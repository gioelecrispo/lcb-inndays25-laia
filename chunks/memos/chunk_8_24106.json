Advisors change\ntheir views, or make mistakes which others correct; this is indeed the purpose\nof internal debate. The result is that advisors are likely to be inhibited if they\nmust anticipate that their remarks will be disclosed to others, not party to the\ndebate, who may misunderstand the significance of a particular statement or\ndiscussion taken out of context. Some advisors may hesitate out of self interest\nto make remarks that might later be used against their colleagues or superiors. As the Supreme Court has stated, “[a] President and those who assist him must\nbe free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making de­\ncisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except pri­\nvately.” Id. at 708. These reasons for the constitutional privilege have at least as much force when\nit is Congress, instead of a court, that is seeking information. 10The United States\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has explicitly held that\nthe privilege protects presidential communications against congressional in­\nquiries.\" 10 The Supreme Court has assumed that the constitutional privilege protects executive branch deliberations\nagainst Congress to some degree. See United States v Nixon, 418 U S. at 712 n.19. Moreover, in Nixon v. Admin­\nistrator o f Gen. Servs., 433 U.S. 425 (1977), the Court held that the constitutional privilege protects executive\nbranch deliberations from disclosure to members of the same branch in a later administration; the Court rejected\nthe specific claim of privilege in that case not because the privilege was inapplicable but because the intrusion was\nlimited and the interests justifying the intrusion were strong and nearly unique. See id. at 446-55. 11 During the Watergate investigation the court of appeals rejected a Senate committee’s efforts to obtain tape\nrecordings of conversations in President Nixon’s offices The court held that the tapes were constitutionally privi­\nleged and that the committee had not made a strong enough showing to overcome the privilege. Senate Select Comm,\non Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d 725 (D.C Cir 1974) (en banc). The court held that the com­\nmittee was not entitled to the recordings unless it showed that “the subpoenaed evidence is demonstrably critical\nto the responsible fulfillment of the Committee’s functions ” Id at 731 (emphasis added). 178 D. Accommodation with Congress 1. Governing Principles Because a claim of executive privilege is not absolute, the executive branch\nhas a duty to seek to accommodate requests that are within Congress’ legitimate\noversight powers. See United States v. AT&T, 567 F.2d 121, 127 130 (D.C. Cir.\n1977) (suggesting that, even when a claim of executive privilege rests on national\nsecurity grounds, the Executive does not enjoy clear and absolute discretion to\ndeny legitimate congressional requests for information, but that each of the two\nbranches must attempt to balance and accommodate the legitimate needs of the\nother)."
