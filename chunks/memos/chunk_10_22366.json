  "chunk_text": "Near the end of last year, the United States government suspended the\nrest pursuant to terms of the contracts. It is legally possible that the\ncontracts could still be reinstituted since they have not been cancelled. We understand from the State Department that nothing in the contracts\nwould preclude our making other disposition of the articles being\nprocured while the contracts are suspended. 10. A Broad Prohibition Against All Transactions Between Americans\nRelating to Iran The preceding analysis suggests that very broad restrictions are per­\nmissible under the IEEPA. A caveat is in order, however. The statute\nis limited to property in which a foreign country or foreign national has\nan interest. As we noted above, Treasury’s regulations define the opera­\ntive terms of § 1702 to include many kinds of legal interests and their\ndirect or indirect transfer. Thus, it would seem possible to reach trans­\nactions in which Iran has an indirect interest, but it is not possible to\nreach “purely domestic” transactions. John M .
