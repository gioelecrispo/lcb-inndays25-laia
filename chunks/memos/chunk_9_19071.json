See\nOffice of Government Ethics, Summary of Ethical Requirements Applicable to Special Government\nEmployees, Informal Advisory Op. 00x1, at 5-6 (Feb. 15, 2000), available at http://www.oge.gov/ OGE-Advisories/Legal-Advisories/Legal-Advisories/ (last visited July 12, 2012). The OGE Letter asks\nwhether a special government employee who is reappointed would be subject to conflict of interest\nrestrictions during the period after reappointment but before the next day on which he actually works. This question seems to concern special government employees who are not appointed by the President\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate but are reappointed annually, either by the President or by\nanother officer. OGE Letter at 3. We believe that the reappointments of such employees do not place\nthem in the same position as the Senate-confirmed appointees we address in this opinion. In many\ninstances, as a matter of practice, special government employees are employed continuously, and the\nsuccessive one-year appointments are primarily a means of enabling the appointing officer to assess\nwhether the work anticipated in the next year will exceed 130 days and require an end to the\ndesignation as a special, rather than ordinary, government employee. See Office of Government Ethics,\nSpecial Government Employees and 18 U.S.C. §§ 202, 203, and 205, Informal Advisory Op. 81x24,\nat 2-3 (July 23, 1981), available at http://www.oge.gov/OGE-Advisories/Legal-Advisories/LegalAdvisories/ (last visited July 12, 2012). We believe that the conflict of interest restrictions would apply\ncontinuously to a special government employee, until he resigns or the agency notifies him that he has\nnot been reappointed. 39 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 49 10/22/12 11:13 AM"
