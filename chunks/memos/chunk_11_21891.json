  "chunk_text": "Before requesting that a congres­\nsional committee issue a subpoena, GAO might attempt to enforce its request for information pursuant to the judi­\ncial enforcement mechanism authorized under 3 1 U S C §716. Such a course of action could be successfully resisted\nby the executive branch without a claim of executive pnvilege, however, because judicial enforcement is precluded\nwhenever the Director of the Office of Management and Budget or the President certify that the information could\nbe withheld under exemptions (b)(5) (information withholdable in litigation) or (b)(7) (law enforcement informa­\ntion) of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5), (b)(7)) and ‘‘disclosure reasonably could be expected\nto impair substantially the operations of the Government.\" 31 U S C § 716(d)(1)(C). Upon such a certification,\nGAO would presumably refer enforcement to the congressional committee. 180"
