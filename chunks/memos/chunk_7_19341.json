It would also impermissibly specify the precise subject matter o f the\nExecutive’s communications with foreign governments.

Before any such station is established, she\nis also required to ensure that the conditions prescribed in section 235A(a)(5) are\nsatisfied. A condition precedent both to the satisfaction of section 235A(a)(5)’s\nconditions and to the actual establishment of any preinspection station is that the\nforeign government concerned agree to the establishment of the station."
