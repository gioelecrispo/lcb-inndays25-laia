  "chunk_text": "The only factor possibly raising a question would be the first. In\nmost instances, a person calling 911 will be doing so to obtain help for himself\nor someone in his immediate vicinity, and thus he will undoubtedly be “ on no­\ntice” that calling 911 will entail disclosure of his location. Even if the caller\nis seeking help for a third party in a different location, he should be deemed\nto be on notice that his call will entail disclosure of his physical location in order\nto expedite the government’s response. 19 Moreover, this simply is not a situation\nwith any of the indicia of unwarranted interference into the private aspects of\na person’s life. In particular, the government’s “ search” is in response to the\ncaller’s request for assistance; it is not a government-initiated intrusion into a per­\nson’s private life. RICHARD L. SHEFFRIN\nD eputy Assistant Attorney General\nOffice o f Legal Counsel 413 U.S. 266, 271 (1973) (warrantless inspections are constitutional where businessmen engaged in federally regulated enterprises “ accept the burdens as well as the benefits o f their trade . . . [and] in effect consent! ] to the\nrestrictions placed upon [them ]” ); United States v. Bonanno , 487 F.2d 654, 658-59 (2d Cir. 1973) (consent shown\nwhere “ informer went ahead with a call after knowing what the law enforcement officers were about” ). 19 Although we think it unnecessary, the FCC could consider publishing a notice in the telephone book and/or\nin the standard service contract signed by each subscriber that anyone calling 911 will be deem ed to consent to\ndisclosure of their physical location. 323"
