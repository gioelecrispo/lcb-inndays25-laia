To\nour knowledge, the Commission has not been called upon to and thus has not\nformally addressed the application of § 439a to gifts made to the President or the\nVice President to defray the expenses of their offices. Moreover, even if § 439a ultimately is to be relied upon to grant gift authority\nfor the President and Vice President, we would advise that guidelines be estab­\nlished for the receipt of contributions under the provision. This will be necessary\nsince the Standards of Conduct regulations applicable to agencies in the Ex­\necutive Office of the President, 3 C.F.R. §§ 100.735—(1)—(32), were not drafted\nwith the intent of regulating contributions to meet the official expenses of the\nPresident and Vice President. Those regulations as currently drafted might not be\nconsistent with full implementation of § 439a if that were desired. T h eo d o r e B. O lso n Assistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel 223"
