With respect to the nature of the event giving rise to an expense, an earlier\nopinion of this Office, entitled “ Political Trips” and transmitted to the Counsel to\nthe President on March 15, 1977, stated the following guidelines:\n' S e e .e /> .2 3 C om p. G en 6 9 4(1944), 4 6 Com p. G en . 6 8 9 (1 9 6 7 ) Scralso 9 C om p D ec. 174 (1902), 17Com p.\nD ec. 712 (1911) 216 As a general rule, Presidential and Vice Presidential travel should\nbe considered ‘political’ if its primary purpose involves their\npositions as leaders of their political party. Appearing at party\nfunctions, fundraising, and campaigning for specific candidates\nare the principal examples of travel which should be considered\npolitical. On the other hand, travel for inspections, meetings,\nnon-partisan addresses, and the like ordinarily should not be\nconsidered ‘political’ travel even though they [sic] may have\npartisan consequences or concern questions on which opinion is\npolitically divided. The President cannot perform his official\nduties effectively without the understanding, confidence, and\nsupport of the public. Travel and appearances by the President and\nVice President to present, explain, and secure public support for\nthe Administration’s measures are therefore an inherent part of the\nPresident’s and Vice President’s official duties (pages 11-12). We concur with the foregoing rules of thumb, which are based largely on a\ncommon sense understanding of the nature of political and official activities. 2 While we would hope that the foregoing generalities may be useful guides for\nthe future, they should not be viewed as inflexible. There clearly is much room\nfor discretion in determining whether an event giving rise to an expense is\npolitical or official. At bottom, the question is a factual one that can only be\nanswered by those most familiar with the particular facts of a given situation. Nonetheless, in general, if the purpose of an event on a trip is to promote the\npartisan aims of the President’s or Vice President’s party or candidates of that\nparty, then expenses incurred in performing the event would generally be\npolitical in character. Should particular questions arise about specific events, we\nwould be glad to provide more concrete advice concerning them. The second variable that may, in some circumstances, determine the character\nof a particular expense incurred on a trip is the nature of the individual whose\nactivity generates the expense. There are some individuals who, in particular\nsituations, are on a trip for inherently official or political purposes. Expenses\nincurred by them should generally be viewed as either official or political\ndepending on their particular role. For instance, there are some persons whose\nofficial duties require them to be with the President, whether or not the President\nhimself is on official business. 3 This group includes the President’s doctor, his\nmilitary aide, and the Secret Service agents responsible for his protection.4 A\nsimilar group would exist for the Vice President."
