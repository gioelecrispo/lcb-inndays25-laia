  "chunk_text": "The conclusion is perhaps more doubtful with respect to\nlesser actions such as reprimand and civil penalties, but here again it is quite\nlikely that disruptions would result. For a Presidential appointee to set aside the\ntime to prepare for a hearing and to follow through with the administrative\nprocess contemplated by the bill might be a substantial interference with the\nPresidentâ€™s necessary direction and control o f such officials. It would also\ncloud the line o f authority between the President and his subordinates. The M yers holding proceeded from the view that the power to remove is\nimplicit in the power to appoint and must necessarily be retained by the\nPresident if he is to fulfill his constitutional obligation faithfully to execute the\nlaws. A different conclusion cannot be drawn with respect to the imposition of\nwhat might be seen as less drastic sanctions. Larry A. H am m ond Deputy Assistant Attorney General\nOffice o f Legal Counsel 109"
