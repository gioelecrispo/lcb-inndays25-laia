Here, the former employee, while with the MSC, “ participated personally and\nsubstantially” in the “ particular matter” in question, which involves “ specific\nparties.” See Potts Letter at 2. The former employee, however, makes two basic\narguments that the statute does not apply. First, he argues that Guam is not a\n“ person” under §207 and that his representation is, therefore, not “ on behalf\nof any other person.” See Memorandum for the Director, U.S. Office of Govern­\nment Ethics, from Former Employee, Re: Request fo r Advisory Opinion Con­\ncerning the Application o f 18 U.S.C. § 207(a)(1), at 3 (Feb. 26, 1996). Second,\nhe argues that his representation is not on behalf of a person “ except the United\nStates,” because Guam is an instrumentality of the United States. Id. at 3-4. He\nmaintains, in addition, that his representation would square with the policy of\nthe statute because Guam and the MSC have no adverse interests in the FMC\nproceedings, and he urges the relevance of the principle that criminal statutes must\nbe strictly construed. Id. at 4-5. These arguments are unpersuasive. First, although Guam is not a “ person” under some other statutes, see, e.g.,\nNgiraingas v. Sanchez, 495 U.S. 182 (1990) (Guam not a “ person” under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983), it is a “ person” under §207. That provision treats even the United\nStates and the District of Columbia as persons; it applies to representation of “ any\nother person (except the United States or the District of Columbia).” It also treats\nstate and local governments as “ persons” : a one-year “ cooling o f f ’ period for\nrepresentation by former high-level officials of “ persons other than the United\nStates,” 18 U.S.C. § 207(c), (d) & (e), is expressly made inapplicable to represen­\ntation undertaken by employees of state and local governments, on behalf of those\ngovernments. See id. §207(j)(2)(A). Representation of state or local governments\nby former federal employees, therefore, could violate § 207(a)(1), the provision\nat issue here. By providing exemptions for work on behalf of the United States,\nthe District of Columbia, and (in some circumstances) state and local governments,\nand by restricting certain other work on behalf of state and local governments,\nthe statute bespeaks an intent to cover units of government as “ persons.” Cf.\nUnited States v. Smith, 499 U.S. 160, 167 (1991) (quoting Andrus v. G lover\nConstr. Co., 446 U.S. 608, 616-17 (1980)) (“ ‘Where Congress explicitly enumer­\nates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to\nbe implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.’ ” ). Guam\nis therefore a “ person” under §207. 327 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 20"
