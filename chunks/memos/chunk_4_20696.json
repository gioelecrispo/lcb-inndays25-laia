The locus of a suit against reporters, editors and proprietors is a matter of\nmajor importance to the publishing trade. If it is established that suits based on\nlibel or violations of the Espionage Act can be brought at any point at which even\na single subscriber receives the publication, the trade would feel itself in grave\njeopardy. Accordingly, an attempt to start a prosecution at a point remote from the\nplace of publication might raise a nationwide outcry from the press, and prevent\nthe public from reaching an understanding of the merits of the case. OSCAR S. COX\nAssistant Solicitor General 105"
