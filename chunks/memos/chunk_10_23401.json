P e r telep h o n e co n v ersatio n with Mr. Jack M iller, D eputy A sso ciate G eneral C ounsel, G S A . 117 from the judgm ent fund.13 (Apparently, the draftsmen of the regulation over­\nlooked the fact that protests costs in CICA cases, unlike CDA cases, were to\nbe paid out o f the judgment fund.) If the regulation were read to require\nagencies to pay such costs without any recourse to the judgment fund, we\nwould find it invalid. The plain language of both the judgment fund statute,\n31 U.S.C. § 1304, and of the Brooks Act provision that refers to it, 40\nU.S.C. § 759(f)(5)(C), compels the conclusion that Board awards of bid\nprotest cases are payable only out of the judgment fund, not out of the\nagency’s appropriation. 14 Insofar as a regulation conflicts with the express\nprovisions of a statute, the regulation is without effect. See, e.g., Dole v.\nU nited States Steelworkers o f Am., 494 U.S. 26, 42 & n.10 (1990); Board o f\nG overnors o f the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. Dimension Fin. Corp., 474 U.S. 361,\n368 (1986); A rizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison T. & S.F. Ry. Co., 284 U.S. 370,\n387 (1932); 3 Op. O.L.C. 457, 459 (1979). Accordingly, we conclude that the Board is not validly authorized by\nstatute or by regulations to order reimbursement. III. Conclusion The General Services Board of Contract Appeals lacks the authority\nto order the reimbursement o f the judgment fund from a procuring agency’s\nappropriation where the judgment fund has paid a Board award o f bid pro­\ntest costs against the agency in a case decided under 40 U.S.C. § 759.
