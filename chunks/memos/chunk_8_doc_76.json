The Daugherty Opinion\nreversed Attorney General Knox’s conclusion about appointments in intrasession recesses. 7 In 1985, the Office “cautioned against a recess appointment during [what was mistakenly believed to be] an 18-day intrasession recess,” Intrasession Recess Appointments,\n13 Op. O.L.C. at 273 n.2 (citing Memorandum for the Files from Herman Marcuse,\nAttorney-Adviser, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Recess Appointments to the Export 22 Recess Appointments Amid Pro Forma Senate Sessions The recess appointment practice of past Presidents confirms the views\nexpressed in these opinions. See Am. Ins. Ass’n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S.\n396, 414 (2003) (relying on the accumulated “historical gloss” to discern\nthe scope of presidential authority where “the source of the President’s\npower to act . . . does not enjoy any textual detail”); see also Evans v.\nStephens, 387 F.3d 1220, 1225–26 (11th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (relying in\npart on historical practice to reject “the argument that the recess appointment power may only be used in an intersession recess”). Intrasession\nrecesses were rare in the early years of the Republic; when they occurred,\nthey were brief. See Congressional Directory 522–25 (listing five intrasession recesses before the Civil War, ranging from five to twelve days\nin length). But as intrasession recesses became common, so too did intrasession recess appointments. President Johnson is believed to have\nmade the first intrasession recess appointments in 1867. Henry B. Hogue,\nThe Law: Recess Appointments to Article III Courts, 34 Presidential Stud.\nQ. 656, 666 (2004). 8 “The length of the recess may have triggered the\nappointments, because none of the intrasession recesses taken by the\nSenate until that time had lasted more than 15 days.” Id. Presidents Harding and Coolidge each made intrasession recess appointments in the\n1920s (during recesses of twenty-eight and fourteen days, respectively),\nsee 61 Cong. Rec. 5646 (1921) (recess from Aug. 24, 1921, until Sept. 21,\n1921); id. at 5737 (recess appointment to the Register of the Land Office\nmade on Aug. 30, 1921); 69 Cong. Rec. 910 (1927) (recess from Dec. 21,\n1927, until Jan. 4, 1928); Declaration of Ronald R. Geisler, Chief Clerk of\nthe Executive Clerk’s Office, Exhibit B, Bowers v. Moffett, Civ. Action\nNo. 82-0195 (D.D.C. Jan. 22, 1982) (recess appointment to the Interstate\nImport Bank (Jan. 28, 1985) (“Marcuse Memorandum”)). This reluctance was attributable\nin part to factors other than the length of the recess, and we did “not say that [the appointments] would be constitutionally invalid as a matter of law,” Marcuse Memorandum\nat 1–3. Regardless, the caution was not heeded, and the appointments were made in a\nfourteen-day intrasession recess. Id. at 4.\n8 As an analyst from the Congressional Research Service has explained, “it is virtually\nimpossible” to identify all recess appointments before 1965, because before that date\n“recess appointments were recorded in a haphazard fashion.” Memorandum for Senate\nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, from Rogelio Garcia, Analyst in\nAmerican National Government, Government Division, Congressional Research Service,\nLibrary of Congress, Re: Number of Recess Appointments, by Administration, From 1933\nto 1984, at 1 (Mar. 13, 1985). 23 36 Op.
