  "chunk_text": "The statute, to\nthis extent, treats the Board like the private NASD, which we understand is the\nonly “registered securities association.” Congress may have wished to treat the\nBoard as private for all statutory purposes, and section 7211(b) indicates that this\nis what Congress chose to do. The unequivocal declaration that “[n]o member or\nperson employed by, or agent for, the Board shall be deemed to be an officer or\nemployee of or agent for the Federal Government by reason of such service” and\nthat the Board “shall not be an agency or establishment of the United States\nGovernment,” 15 U.S.C. § 7211(b), determines our answer. STEVEN G. BRADBURY\nActing Assistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel 5\nMoreover, if the Board were an agency of the United States, a highly paid official of the Board\nwho left the government would be subject to the one-year cooling-off period under section 207(c), and\npractice before the Board by such a former official in the year after his or her departure would violate\nthe criminal provision. The administrative rule, at least to this extent, would then seem superfluous. See\n2004 Summary, supra note 3, at 8. 53"
