Individual members of Congress, including ranking minority members, do not have the\nauthority to conduct oversight in the absence of a specific delegation by a full house,\ncommittee, or subcommittee. They may request information from the Executive\nBranch, which may respond at its discretion, but such requests do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a\nsubpoena or contempt proceedings. May 1, 2017 LETTER OPINION FOR THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT We understand that questions have been raised about the authority of\nindividual members of Congress to conduct oversight of the Executive\nBranch. As briefly explained below, the constitutional authority to conduct oversight—that is, the authority to make official inquiries into and to\nconduct investigations of executive branch programs and activities—may\nbe exercised only by each house of Congress or, under existing delegations, by committees and subcommittees (or their chairmen). Individual\nmembers of Congress, including ranking minority members, do not have\nthe authority to conduct oversight in the absence of a specific delegation\nby a full house, committee, or subcommittee. Accordingly, the Executive\nBranch’s longstanding policy has been to engage in the established process for accommodating congressional requests for information only when\nthose requests come from a committee, subcommittee, or chairman authorized to conduct oversight. The Constitution vests “[a]ll legislative Powers” in “a Congress of the\nUnited States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 1. The Supreme Court has recognized that one\nof those legislative powers is the implicit authority of each house of\nCongress to gather information in aid of its legislative function. See\nMcGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 174 (1927). Each house may exercise its authority directly—for example, by passing a resolution of inquiry\nseeking information from the Executive Branch. See 4 Deschler’s Precedents of the United States House of Representatives, ch. 15, § 2, at 30–50\n1 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 41 (1981) (describing the practice of resolutions of inquiry and providing\nexamples); Floyd M. Riddick & Alan S. Frumin, Riddick’s Senate Procedure, S. Doc. No. 101-28, at 882 (1992) (“The Senate itself could investigate or hear witnesses as it has on rare occasions[.]”). In modern practice, however, each house typically conducts oversight\n“through delegations of authority to its committees, which act either\nthrough requests by the committee chairman, speaking on behalf of the\ncommittee, or through some other action by the committee itself.” Application of Privacy Act Congressional-Disclosure Exception to Disclosures\nto Ranking Minority Members, 25 Op. O.L.C. 289, 289 (2001) (“Application of Privacy Act”); see also Alissa M. Dolan et al., Cong. Research\nServ., RL30240, Congressional Oversight Manual 65 (Dec. 19, 2014)."
