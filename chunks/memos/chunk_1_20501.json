August 23, 1993 M O p in io n em orandum fo r th e A s s is t a n t D i r e c t o r , L e g a l C o u n s e l\nF ederal B u r ea u of I n v e s t ig a t io n This m em orandum responds to your request for our opinion whether § 406 of\nthe Federal Em ployees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (“FEPCA”), 104 Stat. 1427, 1467,1 preserves extraordinary benefits payable under § 601 o f the Intelli­\ngence A uthorization Act, Fiscal Y ear 1989, Pub. L. No. 100-453, 102 Stat. 1904,\n1911 (1988), as am ended by the Intelligence Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1990,\nPub. L. No. 101-193, § 601, 103 Stat. 1701, 1710 (1989), even after expiration of\n§ 601 ’s paym ent authority. We conclude that § 406 does not preserve the § 601\nbenefits beyond the expiration of the latter provision. Section 601 establishes a demonstration project that attempts to improve re­\ncruitm ent and retention at the New Y ork Field Division (“NYFD”) of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (“FBI”) by increasing pay. See H.R. Rep. No. 100-591(1),\nat 11-12 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U .S.C.C.A.N. 2469, 2479-80. Pursuant to\n§ 601, any FBI em ployee transferred to the NYFD receives a lump sum payment of\nup to $20,000, conditioned upon the em ployee’s agreement to serve at least three\nyears in that office. § 601(a)(1). In addition, all employees in the NYFD receive\nperiodic bonus paym ents o f between 20 and 25% o f their basic pay for the period\ncovered by the bonus. § 601(a)(2). Section 601(b) provides that these benefits\nwill term inate after five years. We understand from you that the program will end\non Septem ber 30, 1993. FEPCA institutes a system of pay adjustments for general schedule employees\nthroughout the Federal government, including locality pay to accommodate the\nhigher cost o f living in certain areas. Under FEPCA, special agents in the NYFD\ncurrently receive a 16% increase over base pay to account for New Y ork’s higher\ncost o f living. Sim ilarly, support staff who receive pay under the general schedule\n1\nFEPCA was enacted as § 529 of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations\nAct, 1991, Pub L. No. 101-509, 104 Stat. 1389 (1990)."
