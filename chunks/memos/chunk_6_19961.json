See United States v. R.L.C., 503 U.S. 291, 306 n.6 (1992) (plurality opinion);\nLiparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419, 427 (1985); but see R.L.C., 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in the judgment) (rule o f lenity also ‘‘assur[es] that the society, through its representatives,\nhas genuinely called for the punishment to b e meted o u t” ). In any event, we believe that §207(a) is unambiguous\nin its application here and so do not resort to the rule o f lenity for guidance. See Lewis v. United States, 445\nU.S. 55, 65 (1980) (the “ touchstone” of the rule o f lenity “ is statutory ambiguity” ). 330"
