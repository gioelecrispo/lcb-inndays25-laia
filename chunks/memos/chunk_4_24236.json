The possibility that deliberations will be disclosed to Congress is, if any­\nthing, more likely to chill internal debate among executive branch advis­\ners. When the Supreme Court held that the need for presidential commu­\nnications in the criminal trial of President Nixon’s close aides outweighed\nthe constitutional privilege, an important premise of its decision was that\nit did not believe that “advisers will be moved to temper the candor of\ntheir remarks by the infrequent occasions of disclosure because of the\npossibility that such conversations will be called for in the context of a\ncriminal prosecution.” Id. at 712. By contrast, congressional requests for\nexecutive branch deliberative information are anything but infrequent. 2The Nixon Court explained that the privilege is constitutionally based:\n[T]he privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within its own\nassigned area of constitutional duties. Certain powers and privileges flow from the nature of\nenumerated powers; the protection o f the confidentiality of Presidential communications has\nsimilar constitutional underpinnings. 418 U.S. at 705-06 (footnote omitted). The Court also acknowledged that the privilege stems from the\nprinciple of separation of powers: “The privilege is fundamental to the operation of Government and\ninextncably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.” Id at 708. 156 Moreover, compared to a criminal prosecution, a congressional investi­\ngation is usually sweeping; its issues are seldom narrowly defined, and\nthe inquiry is not restricted by the rules of evidence. Finally, when\nCongress is investigating, it is by its own account often in an adversarial\nposition to the executive branch and initiating action to override judg­\nments made by the executive branch. This increases the likelihood that\ncandid advice from executive branch advisers will be taken out of con­\ntext or misconstrued. For all these reasons, the constitutional privilege\nthat protects executive branch deliberations against judicial subpoenas\nmust also apply, perhaps even with greater force, to Congress’ demands\nfor information. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\nhas explicitly held that the privilege protects presidential communica­\ntions against congressional demands. During the Watergate investigation,\nthe Court of Appeals rejected a Senate committee’s efforts to obtain tape\nrecordings of conversations in President Nixon’s offices. The court held\nthat the tapes were constitutionally privileged and that the committee\nhad not made a strong enough showing to overcome the privilege. Senate\nSelect Comm, on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d\n725 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (en banc). Indeed, the court held that the committee\nwas not entitled to the recordings unless it showed that “the subpoenaed\nevidence is demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment of the\nCommittee’s functions.” Id. at 731 (emphasis added). 3 Finally, history is replete with examples of the executive’s assertion of\nprivilege in the face of congressional requests for deliberative process\ninformation. We have previously recounted the incidents in which\nPresidents, beginning with President Washington, have withheld from\nCongress documents that reflected deliberations within the executive\nbranch."
