  "chunk_text": "Accordingly, we conclude that the share of the settlement amount attributable\nto MCRA recoverable Chapter 17 services rendered by the Department of VetÂ­\nerans Affairs (less the 3% Department of Justice collection fee) may be deposited\nin the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Care Collections Fund. Thus, to\nthe extent the ten-cents-per-veteran figure was intended to compensate the United\nStates solely for its claims under MCRA for services furnished under Chapter\n17 of Title 38, the portion of the settlement amount that was based on the size\nof the veteran population, less the 3% collection fee, may be deposited in the\nVA Fund. In light of the information that you have provided us, however, we\nare unable to determine the extent to which the settlement figure was aimed at\ncompensating the government for its claims under MCRA, and we cannot reach\na definitive conclusion on the actual amount that ultimately should be transferred\nto the VA Fund.
