Here, however, the statutes do not require the Under\nSecretary for Enforcement personally to carry out the assigned duties, rather than\ndelegating them; we have found no codified regulation requiring such personal\naction, see 31 C.F.R. §§ 1.1, 1.20 (2002); and we are informed by your office that\nthere are no such uncodified regulations or orders. We therefore believe that the 233 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 243 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26 Vacancies Reform Act would not preclude the Secretary from delegating the\nduties in question to another official of the Department. 3\nM. EDWARD WHELAN III\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel 3\nWe do not intend here to set out a comprehensive list of all the kinds of restrictions that might\napply to any transfer of authority within the Department of the Treasury, but confine ourselves to the\npresent case. We also note that we do not address any provisions governing the transfer of funds\nnecessary to effect a transfer of responsibilities. See, e.g., 31 U.S.C. § 321(b)(3) (the Secretary “may\ntransfer within the Department the records, property, officers, employees, and unexpended balances of\nappropriations, allocations, and amounts of the Department that the Secretary considers necessary to\ncarry out a delegation” under section 301(b)(2)). 234 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 244 10/22/12 11:13 AM"
