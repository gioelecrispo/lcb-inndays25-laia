  "chunk_text": "We do not\nthink this possibility undermines our interpretation of the NSL statutes. Congress vested\nthe authority to issue NSLs in Deputy Assistant Directors and Special Agents in Charge\ndesignated by the Director, and there is no indication of congressional intent to preclude\nissuance of NSLs by officials acting in these positions. Moreover, as the FBI Memorandum notes (at pages 1 and 7), the Director selects permanent and acting Deputy Assistant\nDirectors and Special Agents in Charge from the same pool of FBI employees (special\nagents and members of the FBI Senior Executive Service). This practice further supports\nthe view that the issuance of NSLs by Acting Deputy Assistant Directors and Special\nAgents in Charge should not raise any special concern under the NSL statutes. 6 155"
