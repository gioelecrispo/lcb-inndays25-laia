  "chunk_text": "See 2 Trial o f A ndrew Johnson 200 (W ashington\n1868). President Johnson was acquitted by one vote. I will mention a third incident that illustrates an interesting variation\non the historical practice. In the midst o f W orld W ar II, as a result o f\nthe w ork o f the House Com mittee on Un-Am erican Activities, C on­\ngress provided, in a deficiency appropriations act, that no salary or\ncom pensation could be paid to certain named governm ent employees. These individuals had been branded in the House as “ irresponsible,\nunrepresentative, crackpot, radical bureaucrats.” T he Executive re­\nsponded to the statute by taking tw o courses at once. T he Executive\nenforced the letter o f the statute (by not paying the salary o f the\nemployees in question), but joined with the employees in a legal attack\nupon the constitutionality o f the relevant provision. W hen the case\ncame before the Suprem e C ourt, an attorney was perm itted to appear\non behalf o f Congress, as amicus curiae, to defend the statute against\nthe com bined assault. T he C ourt struck the relevant provision, holding\nthat it was a bill o f attainder, and allowed the employees to recover. United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946). A ltogether, there have been very few occasions in our history when\nPresidents or A ttorneys G eneral have undertaken to defy, o r to refuse\nto defend, an A ct o f Congress. M ost o f the relevant cases are cited\n61 either in the foregoing discussion o r in the answers that the Senate\nLegal Counsel has provided to you in response to these same questions. Question 7: W hat is the specific support (if any) expressed in any\nscholarly article o r book for the Justice D epartm ent’s\nassertion that it can deny the validity o f A cts o f C on­\ngress? A helpful scholarly discussion o f this problem , together with citations\nto o ther works, may be found in E dw ard C orw in’s book on the Presi­\ndency. Taking full advantage o f his scholarly prerogative, Corw in\nignores the teaching and, indeed, the holding o f M yers and concludes\nthat the President, even though he may doubt the constitutionality of a\nstatute, “must prom ote its enforcem ent by all the pow ers constitution­\nally at his disposal unless and until enforcem ent is prevented by regular\njudicial process.” 2 E. C orw in, T he President, Office and Powers,\n1887-1957, 66 (4th rev. ed. 1957). Question 8: W hat is the specific authority (if any) deriving from ethi­\ncal pronouncem ents w hich supports the Justice D epart­\nm ent’s assertion that it can deny the validity o f A cts o f\nCongress? T he “ethical” obligations that devolve upon the A ttorney G eneral as\na mem ber o f the legal profession cannot enlarge or contract his duties\nas an officer o f the U nited States."
