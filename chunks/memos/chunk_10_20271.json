  "chunk_text": "The CRA requires that the agencies assess financial\ninstitutions’ records in this regard and consider their records when evaluating their\napplications for deposit facilities. In connection with this requirement, the agen­\ncies may promulgate regulations placing reasonable requirements on financial in­\nstitutions to enable the agencies to assess their performance. W e conclude,\nhowever, that the agencies lack authority under the CRA to provide by regulation\nthat financial institutions that do not meet the credit needs of their communities\nmay be subject to enforcement actions under 12 U.S.C. § 1818.
