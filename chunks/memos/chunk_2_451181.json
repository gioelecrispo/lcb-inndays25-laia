  "chunk_text": "Commission, by rule or order) determines are necessary or appropriate to promote\nhigh professional standards among, and improve the quality of audit services\noffered by, registered public accounting firms and associated persons thereof, or\notherwise to carry out [the] Act,” id. § 7211(c)(5); and “enforce compliance with\n[the] Act, the rules of the Board, professional standards, and the securities laws\nrelating to the preparation and issuance of audit reports and the obligations and\nliabilities of accountants with respect thereto, by registered public accounting\nfirms and associated persons thereof,” id. § 7211(c)(6). The Commission exercises substantial “oversight and enforcement authority”\nover the Board. Id. § 7217(a). For example, after consultation with the Chairman\nof the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Secretary of the\nTreasury, the Commission appoints all five members of the Board. Id.\n§ 7211(e)(4). The Commission has the power to approve the Board’s rules of\noperation and administration, id. § 7211(g), and must approve (or modify) the\nBoard’s rules for public accounting firms before they can take effect, id.\n§ 7217(b). The Commission also may “enhance, modify, cancel, reduce, or require\nthe remission of a sanction imposed by the Board upon a registered public\naccounting firm or associated person thereof.” Id. § 7217(c)(3). The statute\nnonetheless declares that the Board\nshall not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government . . . . No Member or person employed by, or agent for, the\nBoard shall be deemed to be an officer or employee of or agent for\nthe Federal Government by reason of such service. Id. § 7211(b). The present question concerns the status of the Board for purposes of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 207(c). Under that provision, a former senior employee of an agency is criminally liable if\nwithin 1 year after the termination of his or her service or employment . . . [he or she] knowingly makes, with the intent to influence,\nany communication to or appearance before any officer or employee\nof the department or agency in which such person served within 1\nyear before such termination, on behalf of any other person (except\nthe United States), in connection with any matter on which such person seeks official action by any officer or employee of such department or agency. (Emphasis added). 2 Because “[t]he nature of the close working relationship\nbetween the Commission and the [Board] necessitates frequent contact between\n2\nSection 207(c) identifies covered senior officials by reference to salary level or to the authority\nunder which they have been appointed. 18 U.S.C. § 207(c)(2). Although the Commission Letter does 48 Status of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Under 18 U.S.C. § 207(c) the Commission’s staff and [Board] members and staff,” Commission Letter at 4,\nif the Board is not considered “the United States” for purposes of section 207(c), a\nformer senior Commission official “could not, as a practical matter, accept an\nappointment as a member of the [Board] or its senior staff,” id. II. Your question concerns former “Commissioners or staff members who leave\nthe Commission to accept a position with the [Board]” and communicate with the\nCommission as part of their official functions. Commission Letter at 1, 3."
