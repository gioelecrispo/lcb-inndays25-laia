  "chunk_text": "If the full Senate or House o f Representatives then\nvotes to hold the official in contempt, it might attempt to impose sanc­\ntions by one o f three methods. First, it might refer the matter to a United\nStates Attorney for reference to a grand jury. See 2 U.S.C. §§ 192, 194. Second, the Sergeant-at-Arms theoretically could be dispatched to arrest\nthe official and detain him in the Capitol; if this unlikely event did occur,\nthe official would be able to test the legality o f this detention through a\nhabeas corpus petition, thereby placing in issue the legitimacy o f his\nactions in refusing to disclose the subpoenaed information. Third, and\nthe most likely option due to legal and practical difficulties associated\nwith the first two options, the Senate or House might bring an action in\ncourt to obtain a judicial order requiring compliance with the subpoena\nand contempt o f court enforcement orders if the court’s order is defied. WILLIAM P. BARR\nAssistant Attorney General\nOffice o f Legal Counsel 162"
