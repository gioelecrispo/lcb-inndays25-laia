  "chunk_text": "111.3\n2 Watervliet Paper Co. v. Commissioner, 16 B.T.A. 604 (1929), is distinguishable. In that case, a\nMichigan taxpayer provided direct services (installation and maintenance of a water system) to the city of\nWatervliet in exchange for relief from taxes. Gross income treatment was appropriate because of the\nclear exchange of tax relief for services provided—the local tax reduction was viewed as a payment for\nservices. In the present case, as in Snyder, Sub1 does not provide any direct services to the State in\nexchange for relief from its SBT liability. Cf. Hurd Millwork Corp. v. Commissioner, 44 B.T.A. 786 (1941),\nacq. in result only, 1941-2 C.B. 7.\n3 Section 111(a) provides that gross income does not include income attributable to the recovery during\nthe tax year of any amount deducted in any prior year, but only to the extent that amount did not reduce PREF-128548-08 5 Consequently, the refundable MEGA Employment Credit is gross income to the\nextent Sub1 receives a refund of the credit, unless the exclusion under § 118 applies. 2. To the extent Sub1 receives a MEGA Employment Credit refund that constitutes\nincome under § 61, the refund is not a contribution to capital excludible under\n§ 118. In the case of a corporation, gross income does not include any contribution to\nthe capital of the taxpayer by a non-shareholder. § 118(a). The section 118 exclusion\napplies to the value of land or other property contributed to a corporation by a\ngovernmental unit or by a civic group for the purpose of inducing the corporation to\nlocate its business in a particular community, or for the purpose of enabling the\ncorporation to expand its operating facilities. Treas. Reg. § 1.118-1.\nHowever, tax subsidies are not always treated as “property contributed to a\ncorporation.” In HMW Industries v. Wheatley, 504 F.2d 146 (3d Cir. 1974), the Third\nCircuit addressed the question of whether non-taxable subsidies equal to 75% of Virgin\nIsland taxes paid in constituted non-shareholder contributions to capital. HMW, a\nPennsylvania corporation, owned STC, a Virgin Islands corporation. STC received\ncertain subsidies pursuant to Virgin Islands Income tax law. The subsidies were\nenacted pursuant to Act. No. 224, which was designed to induce and encourage the\ndevelopment of new business. Each qualifying corporation was entitled to receive a\nnontaxable subsidy in an amount equal to 75% of the income tax paid into the Treasury\nof the Virgin Islands. The Court agreed with the taxpayer that the subsidies constituted\ntax refunds but held that they were not contributions to capital. Id. at 155. The Supreme Court has further defined the meaning of a capital contribution\nutilizing the following factors:\n1. The contribution must become a permanent part of the transferee’s\nworking capital;\n2. The contribution must not be compensation for specific, quantifiable\nservice provided;\n3. The contribution must be bargained for;\n4. The contribution must result in benefit to the transferee commensurate\nwith its value; and\n5. The contributed asset will be ordinarily employed in or contribute to the\nproduction of additional income. U.S. v. Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railroad Co., 412 U.S. 401 (1973) (“CB&Q”)."
