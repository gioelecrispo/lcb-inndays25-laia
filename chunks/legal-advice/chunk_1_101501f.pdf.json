The MHO, a program established by the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (“HUD”), is designed to help low-income Indian families achieve home\nownership. 1 Under the MHO, HUD pays for 50% of the price to construct a new home\nand the appropriate Indian Housing Authority (“IHA”) pays the other 50%. Eligible\nIndian families are then able to occupy the home on the condition that the family makes\na contribution to the IHA of not less than $1,500.00, which could be through contribution\nof land, labor, cash, materials, equipment or other similar means. The family must also\nparticipate in a home-buying counseling program. ----HA’s MHO Program. ----HA administers a lease-to-own program under the MHO program using the\nstandard HUD Mutual Help and Occupancy Agreement (the “Agreement”). Terms of the Agreement. Under the Agreement, ----HA gives each program participant an opportunity to\nachieve home ownership in the project in return for fulfilling the participant’s obligation\nto (1) make contribution to the development of the project, (2) make monthly payments\nbased on income, (3) provide all maintenance of the home, and (4) satisfy all other\nprogram requirements including an annual certification of income and family\ncomposition. 2\nCommencement of Occupancy. The term of the participant’s lease under the Agreement commences on the first\nday of the calendar month following the date specified in the Date of Occupancy3 and\nexpires when the Initial Purchase Price4 has been fully amortized in accordance with the\n1 The regulations governing the MHO, 24 C.F.R. Part 950, Subpart E, has been withdrawn by HUD due to\nthe implementation of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1998\n(“NAHASDA”). Therefore, the MHO program is no longer offered by HUD. However, some individuals\nwho participated in the MHO program prior to the enactment of NAHASD are still in existence. Therefore,\nthe withdrawn HUD regulations are still helpful to understand the MHO program. 2 See Article 1.1 of the Agreement. 3"
