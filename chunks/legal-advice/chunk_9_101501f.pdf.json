  "chunk_text": "If there is an excess in the equity accounts after payment of the maintenance and\nreplacement costs, such excess will be refunded to the participant, including all\nallocated interest earned on these equity accounts. In addition, when the home is\npurchased by the participant, the net credit balances in the participant’s equity accounts\nare refunded to the participant after first being used to pay certain costs and the balance\nof the purchase price on the home. Therefore, there is no constructive receipt of the\ninterest income until these limitations are removed, i.e., when a participant terminates\nthe Agreement or exercises the option to purchase. Issue 3 The payment of any interest earned on the equity accounts pursuant to the MHO\nprogram is subject to information reporting requirements under Code § 6049, since this\nis the type of interest that falls under the definition of interest under Code § 6049(b). In\naddition, ----HA falls within the definition of person under Code § 6049(d)(1) because it\nis an agency or instrumentality of the ------------------tribal government. Therefore, ----HA\nis responsible for issuing the Forms 1099-INT to the program participants. If you have any questions, please contact Patricia P. Wang at (213) 894-3027 x\n182.
