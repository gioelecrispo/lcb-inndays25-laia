  "chunk_text": "The\nrules relating to whether exchanged properties are within the same Product Class are in\nยง 1.1031(a)-2(b)(3). Thus, in the present case, the examination team correctly looked to State 1 law in\ndetermining the proper classification of the County 1 and County 2 pipelines as either\nreal or personal for purposes of ยง 1031. If it is determined that the pipelines are\npersonal property under State 1 law, then such property is of like-kind to other property\nthat is considered of like kind or like class. For this purpose, properties in the same\nGeneral Asset Class or Product Class are considered of like class. 5 If you have any questions regarding this memorandum, please contact Attorney,\nDeborah Gregory at (202) 874-1407. ______________________ Carol E.
