  "chunk_text": "Section 245(c)(3). Since\nwe concluded in Issue 1 that the recharacterized interest income\npaid to TP-FSC by the foreign Tax Exempt Entity here is ECI but 5 See Internal Revenue Code §§ 951(b) and 957 for the\ndefinitions of U.S. shareholder and CFC, respectively. CC:LM:FS:LI:POSTF-129710-02 page 8 not also FTI, the parent/taxpayer is entitled only to a DRD of 80\npercent with respect to its interest income (rather than the\nclaimed 100 percent with respect to its FTI/rental income.) Because the 20 percent of the dividend is attributed to TPFSC’s foreign source interest income, that 20 percent will\nincrease the parent/taxpayer’s financial services basket FTC\nlimitation as determined under § 904(d). In contrast, as\nsuggested in the previous paragraph, if the income were\ncharacterized as rental income, a 100 percent DRD would apply. We note that recharacterizing this O-FSC as a financing\narrangement would make the interest income of TP-FSC possibly\nsubject to double taxation because the interest income will be\ntaxed by the United States at the TP-FSC level and again, to the\nextent of 20 percent, at the parent/taxpayer level. The tax at\nthe parent/taxpayer level could be eliminated to the extent that\nthe additional foreign source income equal to 20 percent of the\ndividend increases the parent/taxpayer’s\n§ 904(d) limitation and if the parent/taxpayer was in an excess\ncredit situation.
