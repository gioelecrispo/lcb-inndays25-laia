  "chunk_text": "Id. We disagree that Arrowsmith applies here. In general, Arrowsmith governs\ncases where a subsequent, unknown or unexpected event occurs, and the proper tax\ntreatment of that event can be determined only after reference to an earlier transaction. In contrast, in this case there is no subsequent event whose tax treatment is related to\nthe integrated steps of the spin-off transaction. Although X and Z entered into the\nemployee assignment agreement in connection with the spin-off, the terms of that\nexecutory agreement fully determine the proper tax treatment of payments under the POSTF-100602-09 9 agreement. However, to the extent Arrowsmith governs X’s refund claim, we disagree\nthat X is entitled to the outcome it seeks. The Court’s analysis in Arrowsmith is not a simple “but . . . for” test; X must show\nan integral relationship between the tax-free spinoff and the employee assignment\nreimbursements. Arrowsmith does not only stand for the proposition that a prior year\n(or event) may be relevant in determining the character of a gain or loss in a\nsubsequent year; it also supports the rationale that, “if money was taxed at a special\nlower rate when received, the taxpayer would be accorded an unfair tax windfall if\nrepayments were generally deductible from receipts taxable at the higher rate\napplicable to ordinary income.” United States v. Skelly Oil Co., 394 U.S. 678, 684-85\n(1969). In Mitchell v. Commissioner, for example, the court held that the character of a\ntaxpayer’s repayment was governed by an earlier transaction because of the “integral\nrelationship” between the two. 428 F.2d 259, 263 (6th Cir. 1970). Courts have not provided a bright line test in these types of cases; rather, the\n“integral relationship” is determined on a case-by-case basis. In Arrowsmith, the loss\nattributable to the judgment was closely related to the capital corporate liquidation—the\njudgment, although it occurred after liquidation, was considered pre-liquidation because\nit was against the corporation, not its individual shareholders. 344 U.S. at 8. In Skelly\nOil, the amount of the deduction in the later year was determined with reference to the\nearlier depletion allowance because the taxpayer otherwise would have made a profit\nequivalent to the taxes on the allowance. 394 U.S. at 686. Finally, in Mitchell, as well\nas a line of similar cases, the character of the taxpayer’s repayment of short-swing profit\non a stock sale was capital because the repayment grew out of the original stock sale. POSTF-100602-09 10 428 F.2d at 264. These cases illustrate that a careful, in-depth knowledge of the facts\nand circumstances of both the original and subsequent transactions is required to\ndetermine if they are integrally related. The Arrowsmith doctrine ultimately is premised\non the idea that, if the transactions are sufficiently related, the tax consequences should\nbe the same as if the prior and the subsequent transactions had occurred at the same\ntime. Seagate Technology, Inc. v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 2000-361, 80 T.C.M.\n(CCH) 759, 763 (2000)."
