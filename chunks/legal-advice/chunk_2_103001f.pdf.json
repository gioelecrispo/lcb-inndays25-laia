The death of the TMP\nis an event that terminates the TMP’s designation. Treas. Reg. § 301.6231(a)(7)-1(l)(i). If the partnership has designated a TMP for a taxable year, that designation has\nterminated under paragraph (l)(1) of section 301.6231(a)(7)-1, and the partnership has\nnot made a subsequent designation under section 301.6231(a)(7)-1 for that taxable\nyear, the TMP for that taxable year is determined under paragraph (m) of section\n301.6231(a)(7)-1. Treas. Reg. § 301.6231(a)(7)-1(m)(1). In such a case, and in\ngeneral, the general partner having the largest profits interest is the TMP (unless it is\nimpractical to apply the largest profits interest rule, in which case the Service can select\nthe TMP). Treas. Reg. § 301.6231(a)(7)-1(m) & (n).\nSection 301.6231(a)(7)-1(e) & (f) set forth two situations in which a partnership\nmay designate a TMP at any time after the filing of the partnership return for that year. Under paragraph (e) of section 301.6231(a)(7)-1, the partnership may file an\nappropriate statement with the Service, and signed by persons who were general\npartners at the close of the year and were shown on the return for that year to hold\nmore than 50% of the aggregate interest in partnership profits held by all general\npartners as of the close of the taxable year. 2 Second, in certain limited circumstances\n(including the death of the general partner), a TMP for a partnership taxable year may\nbe designated by filing a statement with the Service, and signed by persons who were\n2 Section 301.6231(a)(7)-1(e) & (f) set forth specific criteria that the partnership must follow when making\na designation under these paragraphs. POSTSP-107553-10 3 partners at the close of the taxable year and were shown on the return for that year to\nhold more than 50% of the aggregate interest in partnership profits held by all partners\nas of the close of such taxable year. Treas. Reg. § 301.6231(a)(7)-1(f). IV. ANALYSIS & CONCLUSION In the present case, the partnerships designated the general partner ------------------------ to be the TMP for -------. This designation terminated on the date of --------------------------- death. The partnerships have not yet made a subsequent designation under\nsection 301.6231(a)(7)-1. The partnerships want to designate the Trust as the TMP. Based upon the facts provided and the applicable law, the partnerships may\ndesignate the Trust as the TMP in accordance with either paragraph (e) or (f) of section\n301.6231(a)(7)-1 provided that, at the time of designation, the Trust is a general partner\nin the each of the partnerships. From the information provided thus far, we are unable\nto provide advice as to whether the Trust is a general partner in each of the\npartnerships. 3 If it can be confirmed that the Trust is a general partner in each of the\npartnerships, in order for a designation under paragraph (e) or (f) of section\n301.6231(a)(7)-1 to be valid, each of the partnership returns for ------- must be secured\nto ensure that the partnerships comply with the technical requirements of these\nparagraphs."
