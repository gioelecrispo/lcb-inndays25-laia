  "chunk_text": "During the period commencing on Date 6, Taxpayer and LLC were considered to have\ncombined productive capacity of J gallons, which exceeded the 60 million gallon\nlimitation in § 40(g)(1). Because the combined productive capacities of Taxpayer and\nLLC exceeded the 60 million gallon productive capacity limitation at some time during\nthe taxable year ending Date 9, Taxpayer was not an eligible small ethanol producer at\nany time during the taxable year. Therefore, Taxpayer did not qualify for the small\nethanol producer credit for LLC’s ethanol production during the period Date 1 through\nDate 2. We have coordinated this advice with Associate Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and\nSpecial Industries) and the Industry Counsel, Agriculture.
