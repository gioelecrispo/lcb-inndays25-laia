  "chunk_text": "If the\nreimbursements are considered part and parcel of the tax-free spinoff, X may exclude\nthem from its gross income. However, if the reimbursements are integral to the spinoff\ntransaction, all of X’s expenses related to the assigned employees also should be\nconsidered integrally related to the spinoff, and, therefore, not deductible. X fails to\naddress this issue in its claim, but we see it as a logical extension of X’s income\nexclusion arguments. If X is able to exclude the reimbursements from income while\nalso deducting the related expenses, it would receive a tax benefit windfall similar to the\nwindfall rejected by the Supreme Court in Skelly Oil. We believe, therefore, that if X\nultimately is successful in arguing that the reimbursements are not taxable income, the\nService should disallow any deductions for related expenses.\n* * * Please call --------------------- if you have any further questions.
