  "chunk_text": "If it is determined that the services of the workers are not covered under the section 218\nagreement, then relief under section 530 with respect to both income tax withholding\nand FICA tax for the workers is available to the state or local governmental entity if the\nrequirements of section 530 are satisfied. The facts indicate that --------- appears to meet both reporting and substantive\nconsistency requirements, because it has issued Forms 1099 to the workers and there\nare no allegations that ------ members were treated inconsistently from one another. However, further factual development is needed to determine if -------- had any\nreasonable basis for treating the ------ workers as independent contractors, and thus\nwhether -------- satisfies all three requirements to qualify for section 530 relief.
