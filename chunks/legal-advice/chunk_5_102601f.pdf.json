See\nCalifornia Local Law Guide,\nhttp://ccintranet.prod.irscounsel.treas.gov/OrgStrat/Offices/sbse/Pages/CaliforniaLocal\nLaw.aspx. This position is based on the understanding that a contractor who has not\npaid his subcontractors could be deemed to have no property interest in the contract\nproceeds. See IRM 5.17.2.7.1.12(3). California case law has not explicitly answered\nthe questions whether a stop notice deprives a contractor of a property interest. However, it seems likely they would do so given the chance, based on the statutory duty\nto withhold funds. Therefore, we recommend that you return the $--------------to the City of ------------for a continued withholding of the funds subject to the Stop Notices filed by -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
