Step 3: Determination of overpayment for year 1:\nYear 1 tax liability per original return\nYear 1 tax liability after NOL carryback $31,750\n$13,206 Overpayment $18,544 Step 4: Who is entitled to the refund of the overpayment? a) Compute each spouse’s separate tax liability as if the spouses filed married\nfiling separate returns: Gross income S1 S2 $100,000 $150,000 NOL deduction (86,250) AGI 100,000 63,750 Personal exemption (10,000) (10,000) 14 Mortgage interest (15,000) (15,000) Real estate taxes (10,000) (10,000) Medical expense ded ______ (35,219)* Taxable income $ 65,000 (6,469) Tax liability (assume a 25% rate) $16,250 0 * The $35,219 medical expense deduction is the extent to which the expense ($40,000)\nexceeds 7.5% of AGI ($4,781)\nb) Allocate of the joint tax liability based on separate tax liability\nS1's separate tax liability\nX\nS1 and S2 separate tax liability\n16,250\n16,250 recomputed joint tax liability X 13,206 = $13,206 S2's separate tax liability\nX\nS1 and S2 separate tax liability recomputed joint tax liability 0\nX 13,206 = $ 0\n16,250 Thus, in this example, all of the joint tax liability is attributable to S1.\nc) Determine how much tax each spouse paid. In this example, each spouse paid $15,875, which was 1/2 of the original tax liability. d) Calculate the refund to each spouse\nS2 is entitled to a refund of $15,875 because S2 had no tax liability after the carryback\nof S2's NOL. Since the overpayment was $18,544, S1 is entitled to a refund of $2,669\n($18,544 minus S2's refund of $15,875). Step 5: Absorption computation The NOL amount absorbed in Year 1 is equal to S2's Year 1 modified taxable income\ncomputed as if S2 filed a separate return for Year 1. (Note that the NOL would be\nabsorbed only to the extent of the joint modified taxable income if, unlike in this\nexample, the joint modified taxable income is less than the loss spouse's separate 15\nmodified taxable income). As discussed in Part 1 of this document, the personal\nexemption deduction and the NOL are ignored for purposes of computing modified\ntaxable income. Absorption computation:\nS2\nGross income $150,000 AGI $150,000 Mortgage interest (15,000) Real estate taxes (10,000) Medical expense\ndeduction (28,750)* Modifed taxable\nincome 96,250 Amount of NOL\nabsorbed in Year 1 96,250 NOL to be carried to\nYear 2 $210,000 minus $96,250 = $113,750 * The $28,750 medical expense deduction is the amount by which the expenses\n($40,000) exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income ($11,250)\nNote: Had S1 and S2 not divorced and simply filed separate returns for Years 2 and 3,\nthe above calculations would not have been necessary since S2’s individual NOL would\nhave become a joint NOL carryback to the joint return year.
