  "chunk_text": "Regarding potential replacement property, PLR 199911048 issued to the taxpayer provides as follows:\n[T]he timber cutting contracts to be acquired by Taxpayer from Parent and/or third parties will\nconstitute eligible replacement property under § 1033(a)(2)(A) provided such contracts are similar\nor related in use or service to the converted contract…. [T]he replacement property [will consist] of the replacement contract(s) and not the timber which\nthe replacement contracts entitle Taxpayer to cut. Acquisition by Taxpayer of timber or real\nestate containing timber would not satisfy the functional use test of § 1033. [Emphasis added.] 3 from the seller to the buyer. See Merrill v. Commissioner, 40 T.C. 66 (1963), aff’d, 336\nF.2d 771 (9th Cir. 1964). Consequently, a “purchase” under § 1033 contemplates, at a\nminimum, transfer of ownership of the pertinent property. The contract you provided, #XX, generally obligates the taxpayer to cut and pay for a\nspecified quantity of timber over a 10-year period. An “Advance Deposit” is required at\nthe outset of each year to cover the price of a “Base Volume” to be harvested each\nyear. Section 2.7 provides that “Owner shall retain ownership of the Timber until such\ntime as Purchaser harvests the Timber pursuant to the Annual Harvest Plan.” Further,\nsection 2.3 provides that “Owner will bear the risk of loss regarding the Timber until\nsuch time as the Timber is harvested.” Section 2.4 provides that “Owner will retain\npossession and control of the Timber” until harvested by the taxpayer. Thus, even if\npayments under the contracts for timber could qualify as eligible replacement “costs,”\nthe replacement property (timber) is not “purchased” as contemplated by § 1033 until\nthe timber is harvested. In this regard, we assume that all of the contracts are pay-ascut contracts and that the bulk of the $E in anticipated cutting costs relative to the 72\ncontracts will be made after the close of Year 4, which is after the applicable\nreplacement period.
