  "chunk_text": "However, because Corporation X created,\nrather than acquired, its franchise, Treas. Reg. § 1.197-2(e)(2) does not impact the\ntreatment of Corporation X’s ANDA One as an amortizable § 197 intangible. Treas. Reg. § 1.197-2(d)(2) reiterates the statute and clarifies the status of created\nintangibles, stating:\nExcept as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section,\namortizable section 197 intangibles do not include any\nsection 197 intangible created by the taxpayer (a selfcreated intangible). Treas. Reg. § 1.197(d)(2)(iii) confirms franchises are not excluded from amortizable\n§ 197 intangibles, citing I.R.C. § 197(d)(1)(F). As discussed above, an approved ANDA is a government granted franchise within both\nI.R.C. § 197(d)(1)(F) and Treas. Reg. § 1.197-2(b)(10). The self-created exception only\napplies to any § 197 intangible NOT described in I.R.C. § 197(d)(1)(D), (E), and (F). Therefore, the exception provided in I.R.C. § 197(c)(2) is inapplicable to FDA approved\nANDAs. Accordingly, FDA-approved ANDA One is an amortizable § 197 intangible. 3. As Franchises, FDA-Approved ANDAs\nMust Be Amortized Over a 15-Year Period The Internal Revenue Code (Code) provides a taxpayer shall be entitled to an\namortization deduction with respect to any amortizable § 197 intangible. § 197(a). The\nCode also provides that the amount of such deduction shall be determined by\namortizing the adjusted basis of such intangible ratably over the “15-year period\nbeginning with the month in which such intangible was acquired.” Id. See Frontier POSTU-139175-10 11 Chevrolet Company v. Commissioner, 329 F.3d 1131, 1135 (9th Cir. 2003) (an\namortizable § 197 intangible must use the 15-year period for amortization, not some\nother life that the taxpayer asserts). The Treasury Regulations further elaborate on the computation of the amortization\ndeduction by providing:\n[T]he amortization deduction allowable under section 197(a) is computed\nas follows:\n(i)\nThe basis of an amortizable section 197 intangible is\namortized ratably over the 15-year period beginning on the\nlater of—\n(A)\nThe first day of the month in which the property is\nacquired; or\n(B)\nIn the case of property held in connection with the\nconduct of a trade or business or in an activity\ndescribed in section 212, the first day of the month\nin which the conduct of the trade or business or\nthe activity begins. Treas. Reg. § 1.197-2(f)(1)(i) (emphasis added). See Broz II, above (the § 197\nregulations support the determination that a § 197 intangible cannot be amortized if the\ntrade or business or activity to which it relates has yet to commence). An FDA-approved ANDA is acquired for purposes of § 197 on the effective date of the\nfinal FDA approval, provided all applicable exclusionary periods have expired, e.g, the\neffective date is not subject to a condition precedent such as the expiration of period of\nexclusivity barring the ANDA holder from immediately commencing the marketing and\nselling of the drugs that are the subject of the ANDA in the United States. 7 ANDAs are\ntreated as acquired on said date because that is the date the holder of an ANDA can\nbegin to market and sell the generic drugs that are the subject of the ANDA in the\nUnited States. Applying the rule of Treas. Reg. § 1.197-2(f)(1) to Corporation X, Corporation X’s 15year amortization period for amortizing the attorney fees associated with its FDAapproved ANDA"
