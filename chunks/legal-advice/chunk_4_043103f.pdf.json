  "chunk_text": "Such a referral to the\n1 We note the Bureau of National Affairs (BNA) Tax Management Portfolio, is consistent with\nour conclusion that the storage and handling costs are cumulative for existing LIFO layers. “…[T]here is a dramatic difference for LIFO taxpayers, because each year the\nexisting layers will absorb additional costs . . . taxpayers seeking to minimize\ntaxable income would select the basic simplified resale method rather than this\nvariation.” Tax Management Portfolios U.S. Income Series 576-2nd : Uniform Capitalization Rules:\nInventory; Self-Constructed Assets; Real Estate 15. 576-2nd Tax Mgmt. Portfolio (BNA) POSTF-125520-04 5 national office will be treated as a request for technical advice, and the provisions of\nRev. Proc. 97-2 (or any successor) will be followed. We believe that the issue in this\ncase goes directly to how the language in the consent agreement is implemented to\ndetermine proper amount of the section 481(a) adjustment. Therefore, our inquiry is not\nrequired to be treated as a request for technical advice. We note § 1.263A-3(d)(3)(iii)(B) does not specifically prescribe how to apply the storage\nand handling absorption ratio to total § 471 costs in ending inventory. Moreover, the\nregulations do not explicitly state the amount allocated to existing layers is the\nsummation of all prior year storage and handling cost absorption ratios. JOSEPH F.
