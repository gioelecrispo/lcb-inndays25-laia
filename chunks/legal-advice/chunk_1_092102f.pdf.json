[UIL 6321.01-00 Property Subject v.\nNot Subject to Lien]\nConclusion: The Service cannot seize and sell the season ticket renewal, because it is not a\nproperty or right to property under -------------- law. The taxpayer’s personal seat\nlicenses are property or right to property under -------------- law. Therefore, the Service\nis entitled to the deposit for the personal seat license if it serves a levy on the -----------. Facts: The taxpayer owes federal taxes that have not been paid. He has received a\nCDP levy notice under I.R.C. § 6330, which he defaulted. He is a season ticket holder\nof the --------------------------. He hold 16 season tickets. Season tickets have two\ncomponents, the tickets for a particular season and the ability to renew for the\nsubsequent season (“season ticket renewals”). The policy of the ----------- is to allow\nseason ticket holders to renew their tickets and receive season tickets for the\nsubsequent season. In the early 2000’s, ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, the ------ GL-148771-08 2 ----------- charged each season ticket holder a deposit per seat as a personal seat\nlicense. The cost depended on the quality of the seat. In this case, the taxpayer made\na deposit of $----- per seat or $--------. If a season ticket holder decides not to renew his\nseason tickets, this charge is refunded. The ----------- have a waiting list for season\ntickets that has thousands of names on it. The waiting list is at least ----years long. If a season ticket holder cancels, his or her seats are offered to the next person on the\nwaiting list. Anyone who is offered season tickets under this plan is required to pay the\npersonal seat license to receive them. The Service has proposed seizing and selling,\nunder I.R.C. § 6331, the taxpayer’s season ticket renewal. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You have discussed the situation with the -----------’ management, and they have\nindicated that they would oppose a sale, including taking legal action to prevent it. They\nindicated, however, that if they received a levy, they would pay out the deposit for the\npersonal seat licenses ($--------). Analysis: When a taxpayer fails to pay a tax liability after notice and demand, a lien arises\nthat attaches to all the taxpayer’s property and rights to property. I.R.C. § 6321. Under\nI.R.C. § 6331, the Service is authorized to seize and sell the taxpayer’s property and\nrights to property subject to a federal tax lien. The issue is whether season ticket\nrenewals are “property or rights to property” under -------------- law. If they are, they may\nbe seized and sold. We found no case law in --------------addressing whether season ticket renewals\nare property rights under -------------- law."
