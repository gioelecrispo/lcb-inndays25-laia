  "chunk_text": "Interim Rule 325(a) required the\nCommissioner to serve notice of the filing of the [Tax Court]\npetition [seeking relief from joint and several liability] on the\nother individual filing the joint return. Interim Rule 325(b)\nallowed the non-requesting spouse to file a notice of intervention\nwith the Tax Court within 60 days after service of the notice by\nthe Commissioner of the filing of the [innocent spouse] petition. In this case, petitioners - and ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------jointly petitioned from a notice of\ndeficiency and Edwin was already a party to the case. Petitioner -----'s attorneys had actual notice of -----'s request for innocent\nspouse relief. --'s amended petition raising that issue was served\non -'s attorneys in ----, and -'s attorneys were present in Tax\nCourt in ---, when the Court severed -- from the case for the\nexpress purpose of allowing her to pursue her innocent spouse\ndefense. Although the Internal Revenue Service did not provide formal\nwritten notice to -----of -----'s innocent spouse claim, such\nnotice would have been superfluous on the facts of this case. -----------was at all times during 1998 and until at least ---------,\nrepresented by attorneys who were aware of ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'s innocent spouse claim. Counsel for petitioner ---- could have objected to petitioner -------------’s motion to sever or alternatively, could have asserted\nthat - had a right to intervene in -----'s Tax Court case, as\nprovided in Interim Tax Court Rule 325. Counsel for -------elected\nnot to do so. Under former I.R.C. § 6013(e), the spouse not claiming relief\nlacked standing to challenge the innocent spouse relief granted to\nhis or her spouse in a judicial proceeding. Thus, under the law\nexisting when - and ------filed their petition on -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, it is clear that ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ would have had\nno right to challenge --’s claim for innocent spouse relief. See\nGarvey v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1993-354; Himmelwright v.\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo 1988-114. Under I.R.C. § 6015, however, the spouse not claiming relief\nhas standing to challenge the granting of relief from joint and\nseveral liability to his or her spouse in a judicial proceeding. In Corson v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 354, 365 (2000), the Tax Court\nheld that the language of I.R.C. § 6015(e)(4) “was intended to\nconfer some participatory entitlement” by the spouse not electing\nrelief from joint and several liability under I.R.C. § 6015. Petitioner -----'s attorney, ----, moved to sever ----------from\nthe case as it related to her innocent spouse defense on -------,\nalmost -- months after the enactment of I.R.C. § 6015. -------------and ------, counsel for ------, were both present in Tax Court\non -----, when the Court granted --'s motion to sever. Counsel for\n- could have objected to the severance of the case and asserted\nthat - had a right to participate in the litigation of -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------’s claim for relief\nfrom joint and several liability under the newly enacted I.R.C.\n§ 6015, but did not do so. Additionally, the Tax Court has also held that when a spouse\nraises a claim for relief under I.R.C. § 6015 in any judicial\nproceeding before the Tax Court, and the other spouse is not a\nparty to the case, the IRS must notify the nonpetitioning spouse of\nhis or her right to intervene."
