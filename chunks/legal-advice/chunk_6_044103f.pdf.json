  "chunk_text": "This ratio establishes a relationship between the\nselling price and actual cost and enables the retail taxpayer to determine the cost of its\nending inventory by applying the ratio to the retail value of the ending inventory. Thus,\nalthough the retail method permits retailers to compute the retail value of the ending\ninventory at the ending retail price, the entire year’s data for both purchases and selling\nprices must be used to compute the cost ratio. In summary, based on the requirements provided in the regulations and illustrated in\nRev. Proc. 84-57, 1984-2 C.B. 496, the taxpayer must determine its gross profit\npercentage used to convert its IPIC indexes to cost price indexes on the basis of the\ntaxpayer’s average gross profit for the entire year, not a selected month.
