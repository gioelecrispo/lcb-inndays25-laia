  "chunk_text": "These documents were prepared based solely on IFRS. These documents\nwere not identified as supplemental, explanatory, or appendixes. For instance, the\nbalance sheet was not clearly identified as a supplement to or explanation of the\ntaxpayer’s primary presentation. See Treas. Reg. § 1.472-2(e)(4). Similarly, the\nincome statement was not marked as an appendix or otherwise clearly identified as a\nsupplement to or explanation of the taxpayer’s primary position. See Treas. Reg. §\n1.472-2(e)(3)(iii). Therefore, these documents do not meet the exception for supplemental or explanatory\ninformation, and no other exception applies. The issuance of these financial statements\nto the lending bank violated the LIFO conformity requirements.
