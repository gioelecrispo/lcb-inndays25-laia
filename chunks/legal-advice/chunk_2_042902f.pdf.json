  "chunk_text": "The IRS\ndid not give - formal notice of --'s innocent spouse proceeding or\nindicate that - had a right to participate in --’s proceeding. ----- did not in fact participate in --’s proceeding. However, as\nstated above, -'s attorney received direct notice of -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'s amendment to petition in\nwhich she raised the innocent spouse defense, and -'s attorney was\npresent in Tax Court when the Court granted --'s motion to sever\nherself from the case as it related to her innocent spouse defense. On ------, the Tax Court entered a stipulated decision, signed by counsel for the IRS and by --'s attorney -------, which stated\nthat, pursuant to I.R.C. § 6013(e), -- was not liable for any\ndeficiencies for the - through - tax years. (The citation to\nI.R.C. § 6013(e) was erroneous, because I.R.C. § 6015 replaced\nformer I.R.C. § 6013(e), effective for liabilities arising before,\nbut remaining unpaid as of July 22, -.)

ANALYSIS As part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA\n98), Congress added I.R.C. § 6015, effective for tax liabilities\narising after July 22, 1998, or arising on or before July 22,\n1998, but remaining unpaid as of that date. Internal Revenue\nService Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206,\n§ 3201(g)(1), 112 Stat. 685, 740 (1998). Section 6015(e)(4) contains the following provision:\n(4) Notice to Other Spouse. – The Tax Court shall\nestablish rules which provide the individual filing a\njoint return but not making the [an innocent spouse]\nelection under subsection (b)or (c) with adequate notice\nand an opportunity to become a party to a proceeding\nunder either such subsection. On January 26, 1999, the Tax Court issued interim rules regarding the new innocent spouse relief (Title XXXI, ACTIONS FOR\nDETERMINATION OF RELIEF FROM JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ON A JOINT\nRETURN, Interim Rules 320 through 325 of the Tax Court Rules of\nPractice and Procedure). Interim Rule 325(a) required the\nCommissioner to serve notice of the filing of the [Tax Court]\npetition [seeking relief from joint and several liability] on the\nother individual filing the joint return."
