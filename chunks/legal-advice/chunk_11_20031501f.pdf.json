  "chunk_text": "The Year 3 existence of C's profit sharing and pension plans, aggregating\nthen to over a half-million dollars, may belie the company's assertion of a past inability\nto fully fund a pension plan for A who possessed an equal ownership interest to C. In\nfact, the revenue agent has informed us that indeed A did possess similar plans to C,\nbut A exchanged such for a lump-sum payout at A's retirement. POSTF-106186-02 13 Shortly after A's retirement, A exchanged A's Class A stock for an equal number\nof non-voting Class B common stock consistent with the Year 6 Stock Sale Agreement. The relevant documents are unclear as to what consideration A received in exchange\nfor A's 1/3 voting interest in the company. While A's Year 6 Stock Sale Agreement\nreflects that there was a one-for-one conversion of Class A voting stock for Class B\nnon-voting, the agreement does not state whether additional consideration was paid to\nA for A's voting rights. If additional\nconsidera-tion was not received, taxpayer's one-for-one exchange of voting stock for\nnon-voting stock raises questions about the exchange. Taxpayer may argue that prior to the Year 6 Stock Sale Agreement, the amount\nthat A's heirs were to receive on the stock redemption was uncertain. The Year 2 Stock\nRedemption Agreement, although reflecting that the repurchase was to be made\nprimarily using life insurance proceeds, failed to specify an amount for the reacquisition. The agreement did direct that the stock's redemption price would be determined by\nreference to the corpora-tion's book value. In Year 3, A's life was insured by a policy in\nthe amount of $A, although it was not made explicit in the trust document between the\nrelevant parties whether this amount constituted the total redemption price. Presumably, reference would have been to the Year 2 agreement which directed that\nstock value for the redemption would be determined by reference to date of death\ncorporate book value. By couching the monthly pay-ments as deferred compensation\nrather than dividends or redemp-tion installment payments, the corporation can take\ndeductions otherwise unavailable. POSTF-106186-02 14 Correspondingly, since the annuity was to be\npaid to A and then to A's spouse, the amount to be paid by the corporate taxpayer is\nsomewhat open-ended. In Year 3, A was aged 63. Fundamentally, the true character of\nwhat transpired requires a determination of the value of the business at the time of A's\nretirement, the value of the annuity, and expectations regarding interest and corporate\ngrowth. The question as to when a redemption is consummated for tax purposes is a\npractical one to be decided by weighing all of the various factors. Estate of Oscar L.\nMathis v. Commissioner, 47 T.C. 248 (1966); Isidore Himmel v. Commissioner, 41 T.C.\n62 (1963), rev'd on other grounds, 338 F.2d 815 (2d Cir. 1964); In re Lukens' Estate v.\nCommissioner, 246 F.2d 403 (3d Cir. 1957), rev'g 26 T.C. 900 (1956). It is also clear\nthat ยง 302(b)(3) contains no prohibition against payment of the redemption price on an\ninstallment basis. Lisle v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1976-140, 35 T.C.M. 627, 635."
