While the taxpayer presented\nAgreement A, it is not certain when Corporation and k entered CC:LM:NR:----Page 23\ninto that contract. Further, it created no real obligation for\nk to purchase Synthetic Fuel. The lack of current contracts or\nof an available inventory of synfuel is not determinative,\nprovided the taxpayer has “opened his doors,” is actively\nsoliciting contracts and has a facility ready and available to\nproduce, on a regular basis, commercial quantities of synfuel. These things are not evident under these facts. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------b. Please see comments in Analysis, ¶¶ 1. and 1.a.,\nabove. 2. It appears that the Execution Date contract between c\nand Corporation did not constitute a binding written contract,\nas this term has been interpreted in the context of the\ntransitional investment tax credit rules. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you have questions concerning this memorandum, please\ncontact the undersigned at -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
