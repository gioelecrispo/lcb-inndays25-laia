Accessing Award Funds This section provides answers to payment-related questions, including all the information needed to set up your\npayments. For assistance with financial management and award administration, please contact the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one payment system available for accessing federal award funds—the Grant Payment Request\nSystem (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables recipients to use a secure Internet connection to\nrequest funds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States\nDepartment of the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the\nprimary system that agencies use for EFT. A recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made\nsince July 2009. For more information regarding GPRS, please go to\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view the User Guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a GPRS account? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s) will\nbe responsible for requesting federal funds for your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The\nindividual(s) selected must click on https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome and register with the GPRS\nsystem to become a Drawdown Specialist for your agency. Once you have been approved, you will receive an e-mail containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement\nexecutive and/or government executive or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process. All individuals who need access to GPRS must register separately and\ncreate their own unique GPRS username account, as these accounts are not meant to be shared. How do we add an award to an existing GPRS account? If you are currently registered for an active COPS Office award username in GPRS and would like to add a\nrecently awarded COPS Office award to your existing COPS Office award username, contact the COPS Office\nGPRS registration team via e-mail at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following\ninformation:\n•\n•\n•\n• User name (for COPS Office awards) First/last name\nVendor number (as listed on your award document)\nAward number(s) to be added 34 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual How do we fill out the payment enrollment forms? If you are a new award recipient to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on the\nCOPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf. Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001"
