  "chunk_text": "Therefore, the grantee must use the CAGI grant funding to benefit its own population\nexclusively, rather than contracting out the COPS Office-funded officer(s) to other jurisdictions. What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the CAGI grant cannot provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies\nunless they will directly benefit the grantee’s jurisdiction. For example, a sheriff’s department cannot use a\nCAGI-funded officer to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but can use the\nCAGI-funded officer to provide direct law enforcement services to towns within its own county. 13. False statements\nCondition:\nFalse statements or claims made in connection with COPS Office grants may result in fines, imprisonment, or\ndebarment from participating in federal grants or contracts, and/or any other remedy available by law. Why this condition: This condition advises recipients of the consequences of submitting false claims or statements on\napplications, financial and programmatic reports, or other grant documents. What you should do:\nEnsure that all documentation related to your agency’s receipt and use of grant funding (grant applications,\nprogress reports, Federal Financial Reports, etc.) is true and accurate. 14. Duplicative funding\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees to notify the COPS Office if it receives, from any other source, funding for the\nsame item or service also funded under this award. 15 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner’s Manual Why this condition: This grant was awarded to your agency to address its law enforcement needs that are not funded with other\nfunds, including federal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds. Consequently, your agency may not use this funding\nfor items or services that you already have funding for from other sources. What you should do: If your agency receives funding from another source for the same item(s) or services(s) also funded under\nthis award, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. 15. Additional high-risk grantee requirements\nCondition: The recipient agrees to comply with any additional requirements that may be imposed during the grant\nperformance period if the awarding agency determines that the recipient is a high-risk grantee (Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 2 C.F.R. § 200.207 as\nadopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. § 2800.101). Why this condition: In accordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.207, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) may impose additional\nrequirements specific to your award, as needed, when it determines that there is unsatisfactory performance,\nfinancial or administrative instability, noncompliance with award terms and conditions, or other lack of\nresponsibility risk factors. In such cases, the U.S. Department of Justice may impose special conditions or\nrestrictions that may include requiring the production of documentation, financial grant administration\ntraining, on-site monitoring, prior approval for expenditure of funds, quarterly progress reports, separate\nbank accounts, or other requirements. What you should do: In order to obtain a COPS Office grant, recipients must agree to comply with any additional requirements\nthat may be imposed during the grant performance period if the awarding agency determines that the\nrecipient is a high-risk grantee."
