The most recent version of SAFECOM guidance is available at www.safecomprogram.gov/\ngrant/Default.aspx. Quality and accuracy of data Information is only as good as its source, and therefore it is not useful if it is of\nquestionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to\nensure that information from various sources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central\nsystems that are linked to one another and checked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for\nstrategic planning, problem solving, and performance measurement. 67 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Ownerâ€™s Manual Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving\nmust be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to\nthink innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential\nresponses. A major conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured\nand disciplined way is the SARA (scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine\nthe scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more\nincidents similar in one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can\nbe a type of behavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses,\nestablish correlation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is\nimportant to find out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?,\nwhen?, where?, how?, why?, and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem."
