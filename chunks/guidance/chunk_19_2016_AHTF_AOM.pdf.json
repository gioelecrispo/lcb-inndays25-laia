To claim the exemption, however, your organization must certify that it is exempt by logging onto\nthe OCR website at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and following the Certification Form instructions.

Why this condition: This award was provided to your agency to address its law enforcement needs that are not funded with other\nfunds, including federal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds. Consequently, your agency may not use this funding for\nitems or services that you already have funding for from other sources.

Why this condition: In accordance with 2 CFR § 200.207, the DOJ may impose additional requirements specific to your award, as\nneeded, when it determines that there is unsatisfactory performance, financial or administrative instability,\nnoncompliance with award terms and conditions, or other lack of responsibility risk factors. In such cases, the\nDOJ may impose special conditions or restrictions that may include requiring the production of documentation,\nfinancial award administration training, on-site monitoring, prior approval for expenditure of funds, quarterly\nprogress reports, separate bank accounts, or other requirements. What you should do: In order to obtain a COPS Office award, recipients must agree to comply with any additional requirements that\nmay be imposed during the award performance period if the awarding agency determines that the recipient is a\nhigh-risk recipient. 16 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual"
