  "chunk_text": "This includes proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in\nconnection with performance of a Federal contract or award. It does not include audits, site visits,\ncorrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. Conviction, for purposes of this award term and condition, means a judgment or conviction of a\ncriminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or a plea,\nand includes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere. Total value of currently active awards, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts\nincludes— (1) Only the Federal share of the funding under any Federal award with a recipient cost\nshare or match; and\n(2) The value of all expected funding increments under a Federal award and options, even\nif not yet exercised. Why this condition:\nUnder 2 CFR § 200.210 (b) (1) (iii), recipients of awards in excess of $500,000 are required to report certain civil,\ncriminal, and administrative proceedings if they have active federal awards, cooperative agreements, or\ncontracts (or any combination of these) that total more than $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period. The purpose is to protect the public interest and to ensure proper management in federal activities by\nconducting business with responsible parties. What you should do: If the total value of your active awards, cooperative agreements, and contracts from all federal awarding\nagencies exceeds $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period, then you must ensure that the proceedings\ndescribed in paragraph 2 of this award term that are reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) are\ncurrent. The information about the reported proceedings is made available in SAM via the designated integrity\nand performance system (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System 28 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual (FAPIIS)). During the award period, you must either report for the most recent five-year period new information\nabout any proceeding(s) that you have not reported previously or affirm that there is no new information to\nreport. You must also disclose semiannually any information about criminal, civil, and administrative\nproceedings. 25. Computer Network Requirement\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees that no award funds may be used to maintain or establish a computer network\nunless such network blocks the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. Nothing in this requirement\nlimits the use of funds necessary for any federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any other entity\ncarrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. Why this condition:\nSection 533 of Division B, Title V, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L.\n114-113) prohibits the use of federal funds to maintain or establish a computer network that does not block the\nviewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. This provision protects the public interest in the proper\nmanagement and use of federal funds. What you should do: The recipient must not use award funds to maintain or establish a computer network unless the network blocks\npornography. This does not limit the use of funds for criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication\nactivities."
