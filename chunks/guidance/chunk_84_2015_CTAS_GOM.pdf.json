Businesses can help identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own\nsecurity technology and community outreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can\nalso assist in disseminating information about police and business partnerships and initiatives, and crime\nprevention practices. 73 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can\nassist with publicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government\nor community agencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a\nsignificant impact on public perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way departments are organized and managed and\nhow the infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It\nencourages the application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing emphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and\ninfuse it throughout the entire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel,\nand its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management diffuses community policing ideals throughout\nthe agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor\nrelations, decentralized decision making and accountability, strategic planning, policies and procedures,\norganizational evaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture Changing the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values\nsystematic problem solving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal\nnetworks and communication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership Leaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to\nimplement community policing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing’s vision, values, and\nmission within their organization and support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the\npredominant way of doing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized\nlabor must be a part of the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing\nphilosophy. Including labor groups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are\nimperative to community policing implementation. Decision making Community policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decisionmaking. Decentralized decision-making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in\ncommunity policing. When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she\nultimately feels accountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of\nthe community."
