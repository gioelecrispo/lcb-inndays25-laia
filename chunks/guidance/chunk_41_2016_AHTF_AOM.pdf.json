Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the\nComptroller General of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may\naccess these records for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 39 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual V. Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The two primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving\nfederal financial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 CFR Part 200—\nUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform\nGuidance) on December 26, 2013. This new guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments\nawarded on or after December 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of\nSAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR §200.514 (Scope of audit) except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR §200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987 to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit\nis to express opinions on the recipient’s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address specific\ncompliance issues with respect to COPS Office award requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, federal\nagencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in §200.338 Remedies for\nnoncompliance. These sanctions under A-133, section 225 could include the following:\n• Temporarily withholding cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or\nmore severe enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. • Disallowing (that is, denying both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost\nof the activity or action not in compliance. • Wholly or partly suspending or terminating the federal award. 40 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual"
