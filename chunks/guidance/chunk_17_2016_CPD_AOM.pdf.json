Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP)\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the development\nand implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). 14 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that funds the COPS Office, that “the full\nand equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal justice\nsystem is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act’s program to reduce crime and delinquency in the\nUnited States” (28 C.F.R. § 42.301). EEOPs do not impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization’s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private business and has received a single award for $500,000 or\nmore and has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but excluding political\nappointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report and submit it to the OCR for review within 90 days from\nthe start date of the award. For assistance in developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click Complying with the EEOP Requirement. If your organization is a government agency or private business and the largest single award it has received is\n$25,000 or more but less than $500,000, and it has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time\nemployees but excluding political appointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report, but it need not submit\nthe report to the OCR for review. Instead, your organization must certify that it is exempt from the submission\nrequirement, that it maintains the Utilization Report on file, and that it will make the Utilization Report available\nfor review on request. For assistance in developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click Complying with the EEOP Requirement. If your organization has fewer than fifty employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the EEOP\nrequirement. To claim the exemption, however, your organization must certify that it is exempt by logging onto\nthe OCR website at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and following the Certification Form instructions. If you have further questions regarding the EEOP requirements, you may contact an EEOP specialist at the OCR\nby telephone at 202-307-0690, by TTY at 202-307-2027, or by e-mail at EEOsubmisson@usdoj.gov. 12.
