Funds could be used more efficiently based on management actions such as\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• reductions in outlays;\ndeobligation of funds;\nwithdrawal;\ncosts not incurred by implementing recommended improvements; and/or\nany other identified savings. 78 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual • • Questioned costs. Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted from\na violation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, award terms and conditions, or other\ndocument governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable and do not\nreflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because costs at the time\nof the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. Policy and procedure. Weaknesses are identified in a recipient’s accounting practices, fiscal stewardship,\naccuracy of data used in the development of the award applications, and/or inventory controls that led to\nthe recommendation cited in the audit. The recipient is required to develop or revise policies and/or\nprocedures consistent with their existing practices and submit to the COPS Office to forward to the OIG to\nclose the recommendation. After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division will continue working\nas the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The COPS Office will\nissue a closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must keep all\ndocumentation related to the audit for a period of three years following the audit’s closure. 79 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual VI. Reports As part of the TRGP, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report TRGP funding\nseparately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal awards) to ensure accurate\nfinancial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial\ninternal controls in place to monitor the use of TRGP funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the award\nterms and conditions. Good practices in this area include written accounting practices, an accounting system\nthat tracks all drawdowns and award expenditures, and the ability to track when each TRGP position is filled or\nvacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit complete reports, or submit them\nin a timely manner, may result in the suspension and possible termination of your agency’s COPS Office award\nfunding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within\n30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the\naward period."
