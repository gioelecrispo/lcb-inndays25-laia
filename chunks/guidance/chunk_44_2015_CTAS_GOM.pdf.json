  "chunk_text": "Under federal regulations, you may\nexpend grant funds only as approved in the FCM. Any requests to change or alter grant awards require\nwritten approval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Without prior written approval, you\nmust continue to implement your grant as it was originally awarded and accepted by your agency. Please be\nadvised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs (e.g., construction) will not be approved. What you should do: For all modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the “Account Access” link\nin the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office, providing the proposed\nchanges, details of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific grant modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified grant award\nmay begin following written approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for\nactive grants will often be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes. If applicable, your agency is required to sign and submit the modified award document via the Account\nAccess link to officially accept the grant modification. 8. Evaluations\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS Office TRGP. The grantee\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the Attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nAct. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office\nmay assess the way in which your agency implements its grant. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or\nevaluators may study the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect 32 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual information about the programs’ effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In\naddition, they may ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how\nresidents feel about community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be\nuseful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities,\nand obtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate\nany site visits and information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and\ntimely information about your grant activities. You should fully comply with any requests regarding these\nevaluations. 9. Reports/Performance goals"
