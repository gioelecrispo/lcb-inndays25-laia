  "chunk_text": "Q: Does the 6-hour exception apply in non-secure facilities? A: No. The “6-hour exception” applies only in jails and lockups for adults which, by\ndefinition, are “locked” facilities. Q: Must a state count it as a DSO violation when the state detains in a secure detention\nfacility or a secure correctional facility an juvenile who is not in the United States\nlegally but is otherwise a non-offender (i.e., has not been charged with, or been\nadjudicated as having committed, an offense)? A: A juvenile alien who is a non-offender and is detained in a state facility under a written\ncontract with a federal agency, and pursuant to federal authority, has not been “placed” in\nthe facility by the state and is in federal – rather than state – custody. Thus the DSO\nrequirement does not apply. Q: Must a state count it as a core requirement violation when the state detains a tribal\nyouth status offender in a secure detention facility or secure correctional facility, at\nthe request of an Indian tribe? A: When a state detains a tribal youth in a secure detention facility or secure correctional\nfacility under a written agreement or contract with a tribe and pursuant to tribal authority,\nthe state need not count it as a DSO violation. 7"
