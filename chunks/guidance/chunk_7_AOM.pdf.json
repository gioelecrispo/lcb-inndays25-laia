Officers previously employed by your\nagency may be rehired using AHTF award funds, but funding requests must be limited to your agency’s entry-level\nsalary and benefits. Rehired officers are officers who meet one of the following conditions:\n• The officer had been laid off by your jurisdiction prior to the original date of the award application as a result\nof state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) budget cuts.\n• At the time of the award application, the officer was scheduled to be laid off by your jurisdiction on a specific\nfuture date as a result of state, local, or BIA budget cuts. If current personnel are redeployed into this program, they must be paid with local funds. AHTF award funds may\nbe used to backfill the resulting vacancy with newly hired personnel for an equivalent amount of time. (Please\nnote: Overtime for sworn officers engaging in AHTF-related activities is an allowable cost; however, any overtime\nexpenses requested for sworn officer positions must be listed in the “Other Costs” section of your application’s\nbudget. Overtime expenses must exceed the expenditures that your agency is obligated or funded to pay in its\ncurrent budget.)
