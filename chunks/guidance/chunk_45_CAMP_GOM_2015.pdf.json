The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The primary objective of OIG audits is to assess compliance with grant conditions. OIG audits are designed to\npromote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of grants by evaluating compliance with\nlaws, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the operations encompassed in the scope of the audit. How are COPS Office grants selected for an OIG audit? The OIG may conduct an audit in response to a referral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The\nOIG also surveys U.S. Department of Justice agencies on an annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit\nareas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the OIG selects grants based on a number of\nfactors, including the geographical distribution of grants awarded, award amount, population served, and\ntype of grant (both active and expired). As such, the fact that your grant has been selected for an OIG audit is\nnot necessarily indicative of a suspected concern or problem area. The COPS Office’s Grant Monitoring Division serves as the liaison between grantees and the OIG’s Audit\nDivision, which conducts the audit. After the OIG notifies the COPS Office of upcoming audits to be\nconducted, the COPS Office’s Grant Monitoring Division will send out a notification letter to grantees\noutlining the scope of each audit and the anticipated audit timeframe. This notification letter also advises\ngrantees of the supporting documentation required and information necessary for the OIG during their\nscheduled field work, and provides a COPS Office point of contact to address questions and concerns. If you\nhave any questions regarding an OIG audit, please contact the COPS Office’s Grant Monitoring Division at\n800-421-6770. Questions and comments regarding the administration of your CAMP grant, not specifically\nrelated to an audit, should be referred to your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. Typical Audit Findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to grants as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems:\n• unallowable costs. Grantee incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget, were in\nexcess of the approved budget, or were charged to the grant after the expiration date and a grant\nextension was not obtained. • unsupported costs. Specific grant expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by\nadequate documentation. • lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Grantee failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. • supplanting. Grantee could not document efforts to backfill vacant local sworn officer positions, or\ngrantee could not explain reductions in local law enforcement budget or in sworn officer positions\nduring the grant award period. • lack of adequate community policing. Grantee had difficulty demonstrating community policing\nactivities. 36 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual • funds to better use."
