  "chunk_text": "The four primary means of ensuring recipients’ compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n• Site visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to conduct site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is threefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award ii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies iii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare for\nthe review of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period of one or more\ndays. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while on-site or, if\nnecessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 12 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual • Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an\nEOBGR conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative for conducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office’s overall award monitoring\nstrategy. The purpose of the EOBGR is threefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award ii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies iii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve\nany identified noncompliance issues, if necessary, following the EOBGR interview. In addition, award recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. • Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a noncompliance issue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants,\nmedia, citizens, law enforcement agencies, other Federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-bycase basis, COPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS\nOffice staff or the OIG. Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or non-violation based upon the preponderance of the supporting documentation or other facts to determine if the award recipient is in compliance or non-compliance. • Audit liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award."
