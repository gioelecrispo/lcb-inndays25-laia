Reasonable accommodations for applicants with disabilities. The ADA requires that employers provide reasonable accommodations to individuals\nwith disabilities, including during the hiring process, unless doing so would create an\nundue hardship for the employer. 6 See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5), (b)(7); 29 C.F.R. §§ 1630.9, 1630.11.
