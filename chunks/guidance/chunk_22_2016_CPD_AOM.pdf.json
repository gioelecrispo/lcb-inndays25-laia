Why this condition: To further federal spending transparency, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006\n(FFATA) requires, among other things, that information on federal awards (federal financial assistance and\nexpenditures) be made available to the public via a single, searchable website, which is\nwww.USASpending.gov. Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and\nsubaward information and the award term provides guidance to report the related information, as required by\nFFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and\nsystems in place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements\nshould it receive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required to report award\ninformation on any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more and, in certain cases, to report information on\nthe names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the recipient and first-tier\nsubrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the Internet at www.fsrs.gov, is the\nreporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward information and any executive\ncompensation data required by FFATA."
