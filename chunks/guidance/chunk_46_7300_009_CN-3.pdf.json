PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 39\n4.5.7.6. Programs a.\nExamination of program components should be completed to\nensure appropriate privilege and supervision requirements are\nfollowed. b.\nContractors must develop a network of community\nresources to meet the needs of Federal offenders assigned to\ntheir care. These resources must include a minimum of those\nlisted in the SOW for the contract facility. CCMs should\nencourage the contractor to use volunteer groups and programs. It is the CCMs' responsibility to ensure procedures used to\nselect and train volunteers follow the same standards of conduct\nand screening procedures that apply to paid employees. c.\nResident files maintained at the CCC should be closely\nreviewed to ensure each resident has a descriptive, written\nprogram plan. Case notes should clearly address a resident's progress in:\n!\n!\n!\n! employment,\nhousing,\nsubstance abuse counseling, and\nother transitional or treatment needs. d.\nProgram subsistence collection procedures should be\nreviewed. Special emphasis should be on:\n!\n!\n!\n! collecting appropriate amounts,\nfollowing procedures to modify or waive the amount,\ninternal control measures, and\nreceipt and disposition of collected monies. e.\nDuring all reviews, employment records of all Federal\nresidents should be closely reviewed. f. Substance Abuse (1)\nOffenders with a condition of drug aftercare or\nhistory of substance abuse are required to be in drug counseling\nwhile at the center, rather than waiting until they are released\nfrom the CCC. Whenever possible, the resident should receive\ncounseling from the same person and/or agency the USPO requires\nwhen released to supervision. The primary exception to this is\nwhen the CCC has a specialized drug counseling program or\ncounselor that is an integral part of the contractor's program. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 40\n(2)\nContractors must meet with the USPO to develop a\ncounseling program for the resident with drug aftercare as a\ncondition of release. If the contractor sets up a conference and the USPO\ndoes not attend, then the contractor's responsibility is met. The CCM, however, should contact the USPO to discuss this issue\nsince the USPS has agreed to assist our contractors in setting up\ncounseling sessions. (3)\nRandom urinalysis specimens should be taken at the\nrate of one for every 10 residents or less per month; between 11\nand 20 residents, two tests are required per month; between 21\nand 30 residents, three tests are required per month, and so on. The total number of residents upon which the rate should be based\nshould not include USPS cases. Residents with a drug aftercare\ncondition or a history of drug abuse should provide four\nurinalysis specimens every month. Residents who are members of disruptive groups shall be\nadministered a random urinalysis at least once per month. All urinalysis specimens shall be taken on an unannounced,\nsurprise basis and tested for all drugs/substances noted in the\nPRIMARY TEST PANEL included in the SOW. (4)\nThe COS is responsible for maintaining a file\ncontaining the monthly urinalysis specimen report contractors\nsubmit. A tracking system should be developed to ensure the\nrequired number of urinalysis specimens are collected. (5)\nIn the urinalysis specimen program, contractors\nare required to establish a procedure for the chain of custody\nfrom the point of receiving the bottles, through mailing samples\nto the laboratory."
