It is possible that your agency may have excess award funds remaining in your account following the award\nperiod due to an overestimate of item costs during the award period. Your agency should review its records\ncarefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred\nduring the award period. Any excess unobligated or unspent funds should remain in your account, and will\nbe deobligated during the closeout process. Final Program Progress (Closeout) Report After your award period has ended, your agency may be sent a final progress or closeout report from the\nCOPS Office and asked to complete it. This report will serve as your agency’s final programmatic report on\nthe award, and the information your agency provides in this report will be used to make a final assessment\nof your award progress. Equipment disposition\nEach awardee must use any equipment funded through a COPS Office award for approved award-related\npurposes and must retain the equipment for the life of the award. After the conclusion of the award\nperiod, property records must be maintained by the awardee. The records should include a description of\nthe property; a serial number or other identification number; the source of the property; the name of the\nperson or entity that holds the title; the acquisition date and cost of the property; the percentage of federal\nparticipation in the cost of the property; the location, use, and condition of the property; and any ultimate\ndisposition data, including the date of disposal and sale price of the property. A control system must be\ndeveloped to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. 53 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual When the award has expired and original or replacement equipment obtained under the award is no longer\nneeded for the original project or for other activities currently or previously supported by a federal agency,\ndisposition of the equipment shall be made as follows: Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of $5,000 or less may be retained, sold, or\notherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency. Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold\nand the awarding agency is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or\nproceeds from sale by the awarding agency’s federal share in the cost of the original purchase.
