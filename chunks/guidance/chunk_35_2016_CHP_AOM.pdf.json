After completing the training, the recipient should email a copy of the\nNASRO course certificate to COPS-SRO@usdoj.gov. If the COPS Office-funded SRO already completed the NASRO basic training within the last 12 months, the\nrecipient should contact the COPS Office Response Center by phone at 800-421-6770 or by e-mail at\nAskCopsRC@usdoj.gov and provide the location and date of the training so the COPS Office can confirm with\nNASRO and determine if this training requirement has been satisfied.
