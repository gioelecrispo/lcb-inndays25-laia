  "chunk_text": "The most common categories of juvenile facilities are:\na. Juvenile Boarding Institution This is a secure, institution-based facility for more serious\njuvenile inmates serving intermediate or long-term sentences, and\nmay include training schools, reformatories, youth centers, etc.\nb. Juvenile Community-Based Facility This is a minimum security community-based facility\ngenerally with full services, and regular access to the\ncommunity. Programs such as education may be conducted solely in\nthe community. 4.1.2.5. Special Programs The Bureau can contract or enter into agreements for other\nspecialized facilities and services, such as Comprehensive\nSanction Centers (CSCs), Drug Transitional Services, and Home\nConfinement. Other examples are contracts or agreements designed\nto meet specific mental or physical health concerns for inmates\nsuch as pregnancy, mental illness, or a proclivity to commit sex\noffenses. Additionally, contracts for programs concerned with\nstudy and observation cases and drug treatment programs can be\nestablished. Provisions to meet special programming requirements\nmust be contained in the Bureau's solicitation for\nservices/Statement of Work (SOW). PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 4\n4.1.3. NEGOTIATION/CONTRACTING AUTHORITY The Bureau has authority to award option-year contracts for CCC\nservices. The most common award is for five years (two-year base\nwith three one-year option periods), for confinement of prisoners\n(18 U.S.C. 4002). The CO must adhere to the Federal Acquisition\nRegulations (FAR), the Justice Acquisition Regulations (JAR), the\nBOP Acquisition Policy (BPAP), and the Competition in Contracting\nAct (CICA). 4.1.4. TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL BINDING ARRANGEMENTS The CO shall determine the type of arrangement instrument based\nupon the requirements identified in the Request for Contract\nAction (RCA). Each contract file shall be fully documented to\nexplain why the chosen arrangement was selected. There are\nbasically four types of arrangements the Bureau uses:\n4.1.4.1.\nContract (Firm-Fixed Unit Price Requirements,\nIndefinite Quantity) The word “contract,” in a broad sense, means a mutually binding\nlegal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the services\nor the supplies and the buyer to pay for them. Therefore, the word contract can mean a purchase order (PO), or a\ncontract. This provides for a fixed-price per inmate, per day, during the\nlife of the contract. This contract type places a reasonable\nmajority of risk and\nresponsibility for all costs and resulting\nprofit and loss on the contractor. It provides maximum incentive\nfor the contractor to control costs, to perform effectively, and\nto impose minimum administrative burden upon the contract\nparties. Ordinarily, the Bureau contracts for a two-year base\nperiod, to include three additional one-year options. The\ndecision to exercise an option is the Bureau's unilateral right. 4.1.4.2. Purchase Order A PO is a simplified small purchase procedure which may be\nappropriate in a variety of situations. POs cannot exceed one\nyear, nor may they extend beyond one fiscal year into the next. The two most common uses of a PO for Community corrections\ncontracts are: PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 5\na. Procuring services upon specified definitive terms and\nconditions, under which the aggregated amount does not exceed\n$100,000. This is to be used in a one-time situation where one\nor more inmates are placed in a facility, but the Bureau does not\nanticipate using the facility again (single use). b.\nPurchase of recurring requirements, when requirements\nare not known in advance. The amount shall not exceed $100,000."
