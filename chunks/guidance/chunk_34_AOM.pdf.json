Awards terminated due to noncompliance with the federal statutes, regulations, or award terms and conditions,\nwill be reported to the integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS). Accepting the award After you have reviewed the conditions of your AHTF award and your agency agrees with these conditions, you are\nready to accept the award. The Director of the COPS Office has signed the award document indicating approval of\nyour award, an obligation of federal funds to your organization, and our commitment to the award. As stated at\nthe beginning of this section, to officially begin your award and draw down your funds, the authorized officials (see\n32 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual the Glossary of Terms in the appendices) of your agency must access https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov and select the\n“Account Access” link in the upper right corner to log in, review, and electronically sign the award document with\nthe award terms and conditions; the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM) that is incorporated by reference\ninto the award document; and, if applicable, the special award conditions or high risk conditions in the award\ndocument supplement within 90 days of the date shown on the award congratulatory letter. Who should sign the award document for our agency? The authorized officials are the law enforcement and government executives who have ultimate and final\nresponsibility for all programmatic and financial decisions regarding this award as representatives of the legal\nrecipient. COPS Office awards require that both the top law enforcement executive (e.g., chief of police, sheriff, or\nequivalent) and the top government executive (e.g., mayor, board chairman, or equivalent) sign the award\ndocument. For non–law enforcement agencies (universities, etc.), the authorized officials are the programmatic\nand financial officials who have the ultimate signatory authority to sign contracts on behalf of your organization. Typically, these are the same executives named on your agency’s 2017 AHTF application. If one or both of these\nindividuals have changed, please complete a Change of Information (COI) form online at\nhttps://portal.cops.usdoj.gov through the “Account Access” link and create accounts for them so that they may\nelectronically sign the award. If you have any questions as to who should sign the award, please contact your\njurisdiction’s local legal advisor. By when must the award document be signed?"
