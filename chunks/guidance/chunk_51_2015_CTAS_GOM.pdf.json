  "chunk_text": "The TRGP-E/T grant funding is\nintended to benefit the communities within the grantee’s primary law enforcement jurisdiction. Therefore,\nthe grantee must use the TRGP grant funding to benefit its own population exclusively. 37 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual What you should do: Your law enforcement agency should avoid any agreements with other jurisdictions to share officer\npositions or other awarded equipment, technology, or vehicles, unless the agreement complies with the\nrequirement that COPS Office-funded items must exclusively benefit the grantee service population. For\nexample, if your jurisdiction has both a tribal police department and a BIA department, items funded under\nthe grant might be able to be used by the BIA department as long as this would result in an exclusive\nbenefit to the population that you serve. You may not, however, allow officers, equipment, technology, or\nvehicles funded under the grant to be utilized by any agency or transferred to any agency that does not\nexclusively benefit the population that you serve. For example, you may not, during the grant term, loan two\nof your awarded computers to a neighboring county’s sheriff’s department. Before you enter into any agreement with another law enforcement agency, you should contact your COPS\nOffice Grant Program Specialist (GPS) at 800-421-6770 for additional guidance. 15. False statements False statements or claims made in connection with COPS Office grants may result in fines, imprisonment, or\ndebarment from participating in federal grants or contracts, and/or any other remedy available by law. Why this condition: This condition advises recipients of the consequences of submitting false claims or statements on\napplications, financial and programmatic reports, or other grant documents. What you should do:\nEnsure that all documentation related to your agency’s receipt and use of grant funding (grant applications,\nprogress reports, Federal Financial Reports, etc.) is true and accurate. 16. Duplicative funding The recipient understands and agrees to notify the COPS Office if it receives, from any other source, funding for the\nsame item or service also funded under this award. Why this condition: This grant was awarded to your agency to address its law enforcement needs that are not funded with other\nfunds, including federal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds. Consequently, your agency may not use this funding\nfor items or services that you already have funding for from other sources. What you should do: If your agency receives funding from another source for the same item(s) or services(s) also funded under\nthis award, please contact your COPS Office GPS at 800-421-6770. If necessary, the COPS Office will work\nwith your agency to reprogram funding for items or services that are allowable under this grant program. 17. Additional high-risk grantee requirements The recipient agrees to comply with any additional requirements that may be imposed during the grant\nperformance period if the awarding agency determines that the recipient is a high-risk grantee (Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 2 C.F.R. § 200.207 as\nadopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. § 2800.101). 38 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual"
