Reporting Procedures\nEnter in the SAM Entity Management area the information that SAM requires about each proceeding\ndescribed in paragraph 2 of this award term and condition. You do not need to submit the information a\nsecond time under assistance awards that you received if you already provided the information through\nSAM because you were required to do so under Federal procurement contracts that you were awarded. Reporting Frequency\nDuring any period of time when you are subject to the requirement in paragraph 1 of this award term\nand condition, you must report proceedings information through SAM for the most recent five year\nperiod, either to report new information about any proceeding(s) that you have not reported previously\nor affirm that there is no new information to report. Recipients that have Federal contract, award, and\ncooperative agreement awards with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 must disclose\nsemiannually any information about the criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings. Definitions For purposes of this award term and condition:\na. Administrative proceeding means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to\nmake a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative\nproceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract\nAppeals proceedings). This includes proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in\nconnection with performance of a Federal contract or award. It does not include audits, site visits,\ncorrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. b. Conviction, for purposes of this award term and condition, means a judgment or conviction of a\ncriminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or a plea,\nand includes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere. c. Total value of currently active awards, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts\nincludes— (1) Only the Federal share of the funding under any Federal award with a recipient cost share or\nmatch; and\n(2) The value of all expected funding increments under a Federal award and options, even if not yet\nexercised. Why this condition:\nUnder 2 CFR § 200.210 (b) (1) (iii), recipients of awards in excess of $500,000 are required to report certain civil,\ncriminal, and administrative proceedings if they have active federal awards, cooperative agreements, or\ncontracts (or any combination of these) that total more than $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period. The purpose is to protect the public interest and to ensure proper management in federal activities by\nconducting business with responsible parties. What you should do:"
