Inmates must complete a course of activities provided\nby the Psychology Services Department in a treatment unit set apart from the\ngeneral prison population. This component must last at least six months. (3) Community Treatment Services (CTS). Inmates who have completed the unitbased program and (when appropriate) the follow-up treatment and transferred to\na community-based program must complete CTS to have successfully completed\nRDAP and receive incentives [i.e., early release under 18 U.S.C. § 3621(e), if applicable]. The Warden, on the basis of his or her discretion, may find an inmate ineligible for\nparticipation in a community-based program; therefore, the inmate cannot\ncomplete RDAP. (f) Completing the unit-based component of RDAP. To complete the unit-based\ncomponent of RDAP, inmates must have satisfactory attendance and participation\nin all RDAP activities. (g) Expulsion from RDAP. (3) We may return an inmate who withdraws or is removed from RDAP to his/her\nprior institution (if we had transferred the inmate specifically to participate in\nRDAP). § 550.56 Community Treatment Services (CTS)\n(a) For inmates to successfully complete all components of RDAP, they must\nparticipate in CTS. If inmates refuse or fail to complete CTS, they fail RDAP and\nare disqualified for any additional incentives. (b) Inmates with a documented drug use problem who did not choose to\nparticipate in RDAP may be required to participate in CTS as a condition of\nparticipation in a community-based program, with the approval of the Supervisory\nCommunity Treatment Services Coordinator.
