You must\nkeep all documentation related to the audit for a period of three years following the audit’s closure. 37 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner’s Manual VI. Reports As part of the CAGI, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CAGI funding\nseparately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal grants) to ensure accurate\nfinancial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial\ninternal controls in place to monitor the use of CAGI funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the\ngrant terms and conditions. Good practices in this area would include written accounting practices, an\naccounting system that tracks all drawdowns and grant expenditures, and the ability to track when each\nCAGI position is filled or vacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit\ncomplete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result in the suspension and possible termination of your\nagency’s COPS Office grant funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the\nend of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the\nfunding period and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official grant end date;\nhowever, you will have a 90-day grace period after the grant award end date during which you can draw\ndown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before the grant end date. How do we file a Federal Financial Report? All COPS Office grantees are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Grantees are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office website\nat www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the “Account Access” link in the upper right corner to log in; once you\nare logged in, select “Applications” from the agency portal menu, click on the “SF-425” icon, and follow\nthe instructions to complete and submit your reports. The online SF-425 requires the same reporting\ninformation as the paper version. The use of this online application enables authorized users to view past\nSF-425s, and allows them to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports due? (see last paragraph)\nSF-425s for COPS Office grants must be submitted every quarter and no later than 30 days after the last day\nof each reporting quarter, as detailed below:\nTable 1. Due dates of SF-425s by quarter\nReporting Quarters SF-425 Due Date January 1–March 31 April 30 April 1–June 30 July 30 July 1–September 30 October 30 October 1–December 31 January 30"
