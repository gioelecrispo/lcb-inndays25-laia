  "chunk_text": "Businesses can\nhelp identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security apparatus\nand community outreach. The local chamber of commerce can also assist in disseminating information\nabout police and business partnerships and initiatives. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. It can\nassist with publicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government\nor community agencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a\nsignificant impact on public perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime.

It encourages the application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing emphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and\ninfuse it throughout the entire department, including the way the department is managed and organized,\nits personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management needs to infuse community policing ideals\nthroughout the agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal\nlabor relations, decentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and\nprocedures, organizational evaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture Changing the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem solving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and communication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership Leaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community policing, and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders,\ntherefore, must constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing’s vision, values, and mission within\ntheir organization and support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the dominant way of\ndoing business. 54 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor need to be a part of the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community\npolicing philosophy. Including labor groups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are\nimperative to community policing implementation. Decision making Community policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision\nmaking. Decentralized decision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing."
