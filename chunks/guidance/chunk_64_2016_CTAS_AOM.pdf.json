  "chunk_text": "not substantially complying with the award requirements or other applicable provisions of federal law;\nfailing to make satisfactory progress toward the goals or strategies outlined in its application;\nnot adhering to award requirements or conditions;\n64 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual •\n•\n•\n• proposing substantial plan changes to the extent that, if originally submitted, would have resulted in the\napplication being denied funding;\nnot submitting financial or programmatic reports in a timely manner;\nfiling false statements or certifications in connection with an application, periodic report, or other awardrelated documents;\nproviding other good cause for sanctions or termination as determined by the COPS Office. In these instances, the COPS Office may\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• temporarily withhold payments pending correction of the situation by your agency;\ndisallow all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance;\nwholly or partly suspend or terminate your award;\nrequire that some or all of the award funds be remitted to the U.S. Department of Justice;\ncondition a future award or elect not to provide future award funds to your agency until appropriate actions\nare taken to ensure compliance;\nwithhold or bar your agency from obtaining future awards;\nrecommend civil or criminal enforcement by other agencies;\ntake other remedies that may be legally available. In the event that sanctions are imposed or your award is terminated, your agency will be notified in writing of\nour decision and the reason(s) for that decision. Awards terminated due to non-compliance with the federal statutes, regulations, or award terms and conditions,\nwill be reported to the integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS). Accepting the award After you have reviewed the conditions of your TRGP award and your agency agrees with these conditions, you\nare ready to accept the award. The Director of the COPS Office has signed the award document indicating\napproval of your award, an obligation of federal funds to your organization, and our commitment to the award. As stated at the beginning of this section, to officially begin your award and draw down your funds, the\nauthorized officials (see the Glossary of Terms on page 111 of this publication) of your agency must access\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov and select the “Account Access” link in the upper-right corner to log in, review, and\nelectronically sign the award document with the award terms and conditions; the FCM that is incorporated by\nreference into the award document; and, if applicable, the special award conditions or high risk conditions in the\naward document supplement within 90 days of the date shown on the award congratulatory letter. Who should sign the award document for our agency? The authorized official is the government executive who has ultimate and final responsibility for all\nprogrammatic and financial decisions regarding this award as the representative of the legal recipient. COPS Office awards require the top government executive (e.g., Tribal Chairman, President, Chief, or equivalent) to\nsign the award document. Typically, this is the same executive named on your agency’s 2016 TRGP application. (If this individual has changed, please complete a Change of Information form online at www.cops.usdoj.gov\nthrough the “Account Access” option.)"
