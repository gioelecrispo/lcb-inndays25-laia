Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using AHTF funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with operating\nprinciples of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. The recipient acknowledges that it has completed, signed, and submitted the Reviews\nand Certifications form with its award application certifying compliance with 28 C.F.R. Part 23. 28 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found in 28 CFR Part 23. An\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system that receives, stores, analyzes,\nand exchanges or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 CFR Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems which protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use AHTF program funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated\nforms of technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 CFR Part 23 does\nnot apply to this award. What you should do:\nAll AHTF recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence Systems/28 CFR Part 23 as part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to use their\naward funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use award\nfunds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should have indicated this in your\napplication and certified your agency’s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 CFR Part\n23. Your agency now must comply with 28 CFR Part 23 in operating the inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence\nsystem funded through your AHTF award. 28. Sole Source Justification\nCondition:\nAHTF recipients who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group of items) or service in\nexcess of $150,000 and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement process must provide a\nwritten sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating, expending, or drawing down\naward funds for that item or service. Why this condition: In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in\nsome instances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: An award recipient must request written approval from the COPS Office for sole source procurement in excess of\n$150,000 prior to purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract; or entering\ninto a contract with award funds."
