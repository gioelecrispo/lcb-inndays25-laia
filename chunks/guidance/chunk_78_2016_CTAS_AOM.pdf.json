In addition, once you have completed your final drawdown, this report should reconcile with\nthe total amount of funds drawn down by your agency. When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency has incurred but not\nyet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the award period to request reimbursement for funds\nobligated. Please be advised that 2 C.F.R.

Part 200.343(b)\nrequires recipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of the\naward. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period following\naward expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess award funds remaining in your account following the award\nperiod due to an overestimate of item costs during the award period. Your agency should review its records\ncarefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred during\nthe award period. Any excess unobligated or unspent funds should remain in your account, and will be\ndeobligated during the closeout process.
