The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving\nfederal financial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 CFR Part 200—\nUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform\nGuidance) on December 26, 2013. This new guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments\nawarded on or after December 26, 2014 and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of\nSAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR §200.514 (Scope of audit) except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR §200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute in\neffect on January 1, 1987 to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit\nis to express opinions on the recipient’s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address specific\ncompliance issues with respect to COPS Office award requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, federal\nagencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in §200.338 (Remedies for\nnoncompliance). These sanctions under A-133, Section 225 could include the following:\n•\n•\n• Temporarily withholding cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or\nmore severe enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity\nDisallowing (that is, denying both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost\nof the activity or action not in compliance\nWholly or partly suspending or terminating the federal award 41 2016 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner’s Manual • •\n• Initiating suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 CFR part 180 and federal awarding\nagency regulations (or in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding be initiated by a\nfederal awarding agency) Withholding further federal awards for the project or program\nTaking other remedies that may be legally available Your SAA reports should not be sent to the COPS Office. If the U.S. Department of Justice is your cognizant federal agency (see the Glossary of Terms on page 84), they\nshould be sent to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse at:\nFederal Audit Clearinghouse\nBureau of Census\n1201 East 10th Street\nJeffersonville, IN 47132\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) serves as the liaison between recipients and\nauditors in the conduct of resolving and closing SAA audits."
