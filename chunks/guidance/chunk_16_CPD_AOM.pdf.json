Items must meet the guidelines described in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 (Uniform Administrative\nRequirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards) as adopted by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice in 2 C.F.R. Part §2800.101. Travel/Training\nTravel costs for transportation, lodging, subsistence, temporary dependent care, and related items are\nallowable under the CPD Program with prior approval from the COPS Office. In accordance with 2 C.F.R.\n§ 200.474, travel costs for official business directly related to the award will be reimbursed based upon\nthe awardee’s written travel reimbursement policies if the costs are reasonable and allocable under the\nproject. In the absence of an acceptable written policy regarding travel costs, allowable rates and amounts\nestablished by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) for the relevant geographic area will apply. The\ncurrent GSA travel policy and per diem rates can be found at www.gsa.gov. Allowable airfare costs will be reimbursed based upon the least expensive unrestricted accommodations\nclass offered by commercial airlines—for example, lowest discount commercial airfare, the Federal\nGovernment contract airfare (if authorized and available), or standard coach airfare—unless otherwise\nauthorized in advance by the COPS Office. Temporary dependent care costs above and beyond regular dependent care that directly results from\nconference travels are allowable as long as the costs incurred (1) are a direct result of the individual’s travel\nfor the federal award; (2) are consistent with the recipient’s documented travel policy for all entity travel; and\n(3) are only temporary during the travel period. The COPS Office CPD Program will fund award-related travel costs for the awardee agency or other (nonawardee) individuals to attend training and technical assistance conferences, seminars, or classes or to visit\na site specified in the application. Allowable award-related travel costs that were included in the application\nhave been approved by the COPS Office as part of the CPD award and final budget. Your agency should\nkeep timely and accurate records of all travel expenses. If at any time these costs change, you should\nimmediately contact your COPS Office Program Manager. Contracts/Consultants\nCompensation for individual consultant services procured under a COPS Office award must be reasonable\nand allocable in accordance with 2 C.F.R. Subpart E—Cost Principles and consistent with that paid for similar\nservices in the marketplace. Unless otherwise approved by the COPS Office, consultant rates will be based 6 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual on the salary a consultant receives from his or her primary employer, as applicable, up to $550 per day. For\nconsultant or contractor rates which exceed $550 per day, the COPS Office requires written justification if the\nconsultants or contractors are hired through a noncompetitive bidding process, and awardees must receive\nCOPS Office approval of those rates before drawing down award funds. Determinations of approval will be\nmade on a case-by-case basis. Fringe benefits may be paid if they are part of a reasonable compensation package offered to your\nemployees. Particular items of fringe benefits must fall within the categories authorized by the COPS Office."
