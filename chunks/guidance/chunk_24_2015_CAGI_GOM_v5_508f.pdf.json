Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved (construction, indirect costs, etc.). What you should do: For all other modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the “Account Access”\nlink in the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office through the Grants\nManagement Portal, providing the proposed changes, details of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific grant modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified grant award\nmay begin following written approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for\nactive grants will often be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes. If applicable, your agency is required to sign and submit the modified award document via the “Account\nAccess” link to officially accept the grant modification. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS Anti-Gang Initiative. The\ngrantee agrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. 10 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner’s Manual Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the Attorney General for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nAct. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine what programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may\nassess the way in which your agency implements its CAGI grant. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or\nevaluators may study the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect\ninformation about the programs’ effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In\naddition, they may ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how\nresidents feel about community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be\nuseful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and\ninformation-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information\nabout your grant activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)."
