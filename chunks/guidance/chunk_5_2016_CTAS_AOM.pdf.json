What you should do:\nPlease read the entire TRGP Award Owner’s Manual carefully prior to signing the award document. If you have\nany questions, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. When accepting your award, you\nshould ensure that the proper reporting and financial systems are in place to satisfy the award requirements. 2. Assurances and Certifications\nCondition: The recipient acknowledges its agreement to comply with the Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed as\npart of its TRGP Hiring application. Why this condition:\nAlthough the COPS Office has made every effort to simplify the process of applying for and receiving awards,\nseveral provisions of federal law require us to seek your Assurances and Certification regarding certain matters. Most of the Assurances and Certifications apply to all federal award programs. What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS Office award programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at the\ntime of application. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have read, understood, and\naccepted the award terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications. Your agency is required\nto keep Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed as part of its award application. Please read these\ndocuments carefully, because signatures on these documents are treated as a material representation of fact\n4 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual upon which reliance will be placed when the U.S. Department of Justice determines whether to fund the\ncovered award. Additional copies of the Assurances and Certifications forms are contained in appendix B of this\nmanual on page 88. If you have any questions about the Assurances and Certifications, please contact your COPS\nOffice Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. 3. Allowable Costs\nCondition: The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs to meet the most serious needs of law enforcement\nin tribal communities. The allowable costs for which your agency’s award has been approved are limited to those\nlisted on the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which are included in your agency’s award package. The FCM specifies the amount of TRGP Hiring funds awarded to your agency. You should carefully review your FCM,\nwhich contains the final officer salary and fringe benefit categories and amounts for which your agency was\napproved. Please note that the salary and fringe benefit costs requested in your award application may have been\nadjusted or removed. Your agency may only be reimbursed for the approved cost categories that are documented\nwithin the FCM, up to the amounts specified in the FCM. Your agency may not use TRGP Hiring award funds for\nany costs that are not identified as allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual allowable\ncosts incurred during the award period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown."
