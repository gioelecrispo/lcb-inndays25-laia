Community policing also encourages the use of technology to\ndevelop accountability and performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics\nand a broad array of measures and information. 76 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Ownerâ€™s Manual Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely\ninformation on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers\nin their patrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem\nanalysis functions by enabling agencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime\nlocations, and quality-of-life concerns, and to further enhance analysis. SAFECOM Guidance The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Emergency Communications, in\ncoordination with various stakeholder groups, develops the annual SAFECOM Guidance on Emergency\nCommunications Grants. The guidance provides recommendations to grantees seeking funding for\ninteroperable emergency communications projects, including allowable costs, items to consider when\nfunding emergency communications projects, grants management best practices for emergency\ncommunications grants, and information on standards that ensure greater interoperability. The guidance\nis intended to ensure that federally funded investments are compatible and support national goals and\nobjectives for improving interoperability nationwide. Grantees (including sub-grantees) that are using\nTRGP funds to support emergency communications activities should comply with the latest version of\nSAFECOM Guidance, including provisions on technical standards that ensure and enhance interoperable\ncommunications. The most recent version of SAFECOM Guidance is available at: www.safecomprogram. gov/grant/Default.aspx. Quality and accuracy of data Information is only as good as its source, and therefore it is not useful if it is of\nquestionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to\nensure that information from various sources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central\nsystems that are linked to one another and checked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for\nstrategic planning, problem solving, and performance measurement. Problem solving\nProblem solving is the process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified\nproblems to develop and evaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving\nmust be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to\nthink innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential\nresponses. A major conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured\nand disciplined way is the SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine\nthe scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase."
