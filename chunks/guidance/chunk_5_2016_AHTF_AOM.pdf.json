Part 31 (FAR Part 31) as applicable (Contract Cost Principles and Procedures); representations\nmade in the AHTF award application; and all other applicable program requirements, laws, orders, regulations, or\ncirculars. 3 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition: This manual has been designed to inform you of the requirements, laws, regulations, and policies that apply to\nyour award. Your agency will be responsible for the information and rules contained in this manual and for\nimplementing your award in compliance with the applicable terms, conditions, and regulations. More detailed\nguidance regarding any particular award requirement or your agency’s specific circumstances can be requested\nthrough your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. What you should do:\nPlease read the entire AHTF Award Owner’s Manual carefully prior to signing the award document. If you have\nany questions, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. When accepting your award, you\nshould ensure that the proper reporting and financial systems are in place to satisfy the award requirements. 2. Assurances and Certifications\nCondition: The recipient acknowledges its agreement to comply with the Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed as\npart of its AHTF application. Why this condition:\nAlthough the COPS Office has made every effort to simplify the process of applying for and receiving awards,\nseveral provisions of federal law require us to obtain the recipient’s signed Assurances and Certifications\nregarding certain matters. Most of the Assurances and Certifications apply to all federal award programs. What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS Office award programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at the\ntime of application and application update. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have\nread, understood, and accepted the award terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications. Please read these documents carefully, because signatures on these documents are treated as a material\nrepresentation of fact upon which reliance was placed when the U.S. Department of Justice determined whether\nto fund the covered award. Additional copies of the Assurances and Certifications forms are contained in\nappendix B on page 52 of this manual. If you have any questions about them, please contact your COPS Office\nGrant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. 3. Allowable Costs\nCondition:"
