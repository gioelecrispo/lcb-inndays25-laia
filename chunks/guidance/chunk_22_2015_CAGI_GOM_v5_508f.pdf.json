  "chunk_text": "• Equipment and technology must be purchased on or after the award start date (unless an exception is authorized in writing by the COPS Office) and must be in addition to purchases that\nthe grantee is obligated or funded to make in the current budget. Funds currently allocated to\npurchase equipment or technology may not be reallocated to other purposes or reimbursed\nupon the award of a COPS Anti-Gang Initiative grant. For example, a grantee who has budgeted\nlocal funds to pay for a new computer system may not reallocate those funds to pay for any other\nlaw enforcement cost as a result of receiving CAGI funds for the same computer system. 8 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner’s Manual Overtime To meet this grant condition, you must ensure the following: • Sworn officer overtime exceeds expenditures that you are obligated or funded to pay in the current budget. Funds currently allocated to pay for overtime may not be reallocated to other\npurposes or reimbursed upon the award of a COPS Anti-Gang Initiative grant. Additionally, by the\nconditions of this grant, you are required to track all overtime funded through the COPS AntiGang Initiative. Training To meet this grant condition, you must ensure the following: • Any training provided by the COPS Anti-Gang Initiative is in addition to the number of hours of training already provided by your agency. Funds currently allocated for training may not be\nreallocated to other purposes. Note: This grant condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your\nagency under this grant. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any state or locally funded partnership\nagencies use COPS Office funds only to supplement, not supplant, their state or local funding as described\nin this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the grant award period to receive additional time to implement your\ngrant program. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Grants may be extended a maximum of 24\nmonths beyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 24 months will be evaluated\non a case-by-case basis. Only those grantees that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted\nno-cost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays,\nor other circumstances that interrupt the 24-month grant funding period. An extension allows your agency to\ncompensate for such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 24 months of funding. Extension\nrequests must be received prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the grant award period require prior written approval from the\nCOPS Office. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding\nfor costs incurred beyond the official grant award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks\nto accommodate reasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS\nOffice grant. What you should do:"
