  "chunk_text": "The\npurpose of the EOBGR is three-fold: 2. i.\nii.\niii. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review the recipient’s community policing strategies To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one to two day period. Compliance reviews will be conducted for\nactive awards to address any noncompliance and/or administrative issues identified during the review. In\naddition, award recipients will also receive customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS component may refer a noncompliance issue\nto the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media,\ncitizens, law enforcement agencies, other federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case\nbasis, COPS ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate\ncomplaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office\nstaff or the OIG. Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or non-violation based upon the supporting\ndocumentation and/or other factors used to make a determination for compliance or non-compliance. Audit liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event\nyour agency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance and/or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with\nyour agency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may\ninclude repayment of award funds and/or providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance\nand/or providing proof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the causes\nfor the noncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award\nfunds, or a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time. Under certain conditions,\nadditional actions may include referral and placement on the U.S. Department of Justice’s High Risk List, which\nwill include mandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training and being 43 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual subject to increased monitoring of current and future awards while on the list."
