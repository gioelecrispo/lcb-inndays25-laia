Recipient failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. Funds to better use. Funds could be used more efficiently based on management actions such as\nreductions in outlays; deobligation of funds; withdrawal; costs not incurred by implementing recommended\nimprovements; and other identified savings. Questioned costs. Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted from\na violation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, award terms and conditions, or other\ndocument governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable and do not\nreflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because costs at the time\nof the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. Policy and procedure. Weaknesses are identified in a recipient’s accounting practices, fiscal stewardship,\naccuracy of data used in the development of the award applications, and/or inventory controls that led to\nthe recommendation cited in the audit. The recipient is required to develop or revise policies and/or\nprocedures consistent with their existing practices and submit to the COPS Office to forward to the OIG to\nclose the recommendation. After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division will continue working\nas the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The COPS Office will\nissue a closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must keep all\ndocumentation related to the audit for a period of three years following the audit’s closure. 57 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual VII. Reports As part of the CPD program, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CPD award\nfunding separately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal awards) to ensure\naccurate financial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have\nfinancial internal controls in place to monitor the use of CPD funding and ensure that its use is consistent with\nthe award terms and conditions. Good practices in this area would include written accounting practices, an\naccounting system that tracks all drawdowns and award expenditures, and the ability to track when awardfunded positions are filled or approved purchases are made. Failure to submit complete reports or submit them in a\ntimely manner may result in the suspension and possible termination of your agency’s COPS Office award funding or\nother remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of\nthe award period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding\nperiod and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds."
