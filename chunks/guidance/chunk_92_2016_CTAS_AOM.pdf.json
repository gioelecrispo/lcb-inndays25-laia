An inclusive list of stakeholders for the\nselected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents\nsimilar in one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of\nbehavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with\ninput from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. 100 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Ownerâ€™s Manual Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding\nof the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish\ncorrelation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to\nfind out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?, when?, where?,\nhow?, why?, and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem. The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem or reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but\nalso gathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process,\noutcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis\nshould be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and\ntested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear, meaning that additional scanning,\nanalysis, or responses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for example,\ncapable guardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders (e.g.,\nparents, friends, and probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees, and\nmotel clerks)."
