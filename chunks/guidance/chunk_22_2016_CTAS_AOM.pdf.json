Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. Other compensation, if the aggregate value of all such other compensation (e.g., severance,\ntermination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or\nproperty) for the executive exceeds $10,000. 20 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition: To further federal spending transparency, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006\n(FFATA) requires, among other things, that information on federal awards (federal financial assistance and\nexpenditures) be made available to the public via a single, searchable website, which is\nwww.USASpending.gov. Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and\nsub-award information, and the award term provides guidance to report the related information as required by\nFFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and\nsystems in place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements\nshould it receive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required to report award\ninformation on any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to report information on\nthe names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the recipient and first-tier\nsubrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the website at www.fsrs.gov, is the\nreporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward information and any executive\ncompensation data required by FFATA. The subaward information entered in FSRS will then be displayed on\nwww.USASpending.gov associated with your agency’s award, furthering federal spending transparency. For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting requirements, please\nsee Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register,\nwww.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-09-14/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 17. Debarment and Suspension\nCondition: The recipient agrees not to award federal funds under this program to any party which is debarred or suspended from\nparticipation in Federal assistance programs. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, recipients are required to ensure that federal funds are not given to parties that are\ndebarred or suspended from participation in federal assistance programs. This is to protect the public interest\nand to ensure proper management and integrity in federal activities by conducting business only with\nresponsible parties. For details regarding the debarment and suspension requirements, please see 2 CFR Part\n180 (Government-wide Debarment and Suspension), and 2 CFR Part 2867 (DOJ-specific requirements.) What you should do: If under a COPS Office award you enter into a contract for goods or services for $25,000 or more or any\nsubaward, you must verify that the vendor or subrecipient and their respective principals (e.g., owners, top\nmanagers) with whom you intend to do business are not excluded or disqualified from participation in federal\nassistance programs."
