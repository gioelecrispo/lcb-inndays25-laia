  "chunk_text": "Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community—volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters—are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific goals at\ntown hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the community,\nand team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncommon interests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups,\nadvocacy groups, community development corporations, and the faith community. 74 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because\nthey often bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help\nidentify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and\ncommunity outreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating\ninformation about police-business partnerships and initiatives, and crime prevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community\nagencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on\npublic perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how\nthe infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages\nthe application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the\nentire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem\nsolving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and\ncommunication that take place within agencies to support this orientation."
