  "chunk_text": "If your agency draws down excess COPS\nOffice award funding for indirect costs, please return the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a revised\nFederal Financial Report (SF-425). See the COPS Office website for a fact sheet on indirect costs,\nhttp://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2016AwardDocs/ctas/Indirect_Cost_Rate_Fact_Sheet.pdf. Please be advised that recipients may not use COPS Office funding for the same item or service also funded by\nanother U.S. Department of Justice award. See also award condition #13 on page 46, “Duplicative Funding.” Note that certain “Controlled Equipment” as described in the “Recommendations Pursuant to EXECUTIVE\nORDER 13688 Federal Support for Local Law Enforcement Equipment Acquisition,” available at\nwww.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/le_equipment_wg_final_report_final.pdf may be\ndisallowed or require additional justification and certifications. 4. Supplementing, Not Supplanting\nCondition:\nState, local, and tribal governments must use TRGP Equipment/Training award funds to supplement, and not\nsupplant, state, local, or BIA funds that are already committed or otherwise would have been committed for award\npurposes (hiring, training, purchases, and/or activities) during the award period. In other words, recipients may not\nuse COPS Office funds to supplant (replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to the COPS\nOffice-funded item(s) in the absence of the COPS Office award. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds may not be used to replace\nstate or local funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made\navailable for the award purposes. 38 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual What you should do:\nTRGP-E/T recipients may not use award funds to pay for any item or cost funded under the award (equipment,\npersonnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA funds or committed\nto the recipient’s budget. If you have questions concerning this award term, and how it pertains to your project\nbudget, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. In addition, recipients may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within the law enforcement\nbudget to another as a result of receiving TRGP award funds. For example, recipients who have budgeted funds\nto pay for new computer equipment may not reallocate those funds to pay for any other law enforcement cost\nas a result of receiving TRGP-E/T award funds for the same computer equipment. TRGP Equipment and Training—To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n• • Equipment and technology must be purchased on or after the award start date (unless an exception is\nauthorized in writing by the COPS Office) in addition to purchases that the recipient has obligated funding\nin the current budget to make. Funds currently allocated to purchase equipment or technology may not be\nreallocated to other purposes or reimbursed upon the receipt of a TRGP-E/T award. For example, recipients\nwho have budgeted local funds to pay for a new computer system may not reallocate those funds to pay for\nany other law enforcement cost as a result of receiving TRGP-E/T funds for the same computer system."
