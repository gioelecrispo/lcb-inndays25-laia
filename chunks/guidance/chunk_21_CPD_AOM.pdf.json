Evaluations\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS Office Community\nPolicing Development program. The awardee agrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nact. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may\nassess the way in which your agency implements its CPD award. COPS Office staff or evaluators may study\nthe effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about\nthe programs’ effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they\nmay ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel\nabout community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other\ncommunities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities,\nand obtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate any\nsite visits and information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely\ninformation about your award activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these\nevaluations. 9. Reports/Performance goals To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is\nused to track your agency’s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to\ngauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency’s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding. 10 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure\nthe proper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the\nprogress of our programs and awardees. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with CPD\nawards. All reports should be submitted to the COPS Office within the deadlines given to avoid suspension\nor possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions. For more information, please refer to\nsection VII, “Reports,” on page 50 of this manual. 10."
