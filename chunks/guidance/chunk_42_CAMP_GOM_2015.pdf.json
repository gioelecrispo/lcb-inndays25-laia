Your agency should minimize the time between your drawdown of grant funds and your payment of grant\ncosts to avoid earning excess interest on your grant funds. You must account for interest earned on advances\nof federal funds as follows:\n• COPS grant award recipients must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(9) that states that interest\nearned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year may\nbe retained by the grantee for administrative expense. Interest earned on federal advance payments\ndeposited in interest-bearing accounts in excess of $500 must be remitted annually to the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Make check payable to “The Department of Health and\nHuman Services” and mail check to treasury approved lockbox: HHS Program Support Center, P.O. Box\n530231, Atlanta, GA 30353-0231. (Please allow 4–6 weeks for processing of a payment by check to be\napplied to the appropriate Payment Management System (PMS) account.)\n• Please notify your COPS Office Staff Accountant in the COPS Office Financial Division when any interest\nthat is earned is remitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Payment Management\nSystem.\n• For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified\nat 31 C.F.R. Part 205 “Rules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers” and TFM 4A-2000\nOverall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies. Matching funds\nUnder the 2015 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program, no local match is required. The COPS Office is\nfunding 100 percent of the allowable items approved in your FCM. (If applicable, any salary and benefit\ncosts higher than entry level must be paid by your agency with local funds.) Please note: If the total cost\nof allowable items exceeds the approved budget, then the additional expenditures are encouraged to be\nreported on line 10j of the SF-425 as recipient share of expenditures. 33 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual IV. Financial Record Maintenance Under the COPS Office CAMP grant, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems\nand financial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include\nboth federal funds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately\naccount for the funds awarded. As stated in 2 C.F.R. 200.62 (Internal Control over Compliance Requirements for Federal Awards), your\naccounting system should\n• present and itemize actual expenditures of funded items;\n• demonstrate that funds are spent in compliance with your grant conditions;\n• be able to provide the necessary information for periodic financial review and audit. What records must be kept? Your agency’s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and\ncomplete disclosure of the financial activity under your CAMP grant."
