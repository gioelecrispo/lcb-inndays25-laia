Although recipients are encouraged to earn program income\nto defray program costs where appropriate, most COPS\nOffice awards are not conducive to generating program\nincome. Contact your COPS Office program manager or\ngrant program specialist to determine if revenue generated 1. Program income is defined by 2 C.F.R. § 200.80 in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost\nPrinciples, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards as adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in\n2 C.F.R. § 2800.101 for awards made after December 26, 2014. Prior awards would follow 28 C.F.R. §§\n66.25 and 70.24. 2. See 28 C.F.R. § 200.400(g). 1. deducted from total allowable project costs to determine\nnet allowable costs to reduce the federal award; 2. added to the federal award to increase funds committed\nto the project; 3. used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement\nof the federal award. Unless otherwise specified in the award terms and conditions\nor approved by the COPS Office, program income will be\nused to defray program costs and reduce the federal share\nof the project. Program income not anticipated at the time\nof the award must be used to reduce the federal award\nand recipient contributions rather than to increase funds\ncommitted to the project. For example, if you were awarded\n$100,000 in COPS Office funding with no local match\nrequirement to support a conference and earned $5,000 in\nprogram income from registration fees generated from that\nconference, an excess of $5,000 would remain in award\nfunds at the completion of the project. The $5,000 would\nbe returned to the Federal Government, thereby reducing\nthe federal share of the project. Program Income 2 In some cases, with prior approval, recipients may be able to\nwork with their COPS Office program manager to identify\nadditional project-related allowable costs that could be\nsupported with program income. Earned program income can be spent only on allowable\nproject costs incurred during the award period. Program\nincome cannot be commingled with other awards and cannot\nbe used for purposes outside of the scope of the award that\ngenerated the income. There are a variety of circumstances that can affect how\nprogram income is treated. If you anticipate generating\nprogram income, please contact your COPS Office program\nmanager, grant program specialist, or designated financial\nanalyst for guidance. How should recipients report\nprogram income? You are required to report gross program income earned\nand expended on the Federal Financial Report (SF-425)3\nsubmitted each quarter. How you complete the report\ndepends on when you earn and spend the program income\nand the status of your award. Using the example above\nwhere you earned $5,000 from registration fees, you would enter the total amount of program income earned ($5,000)\non 10.l and the total amount of program income expended\non line 10.m. 4 Program income earned and expended must be reported on\na cumulative basis. You must manually enter these\ncumulative amounts each quarter, as the SF-425 form does\nnot automatically calculate these amounts."
