  "chunk_text": "The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised June 27, 2003 and again\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003 to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The new Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 2 C.F.R. Part 200 — Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform\nGuidance) was effective on December 26, 2013, was implemented by federal agencies on the required\neffective date of December 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of\nSAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? A nonfederal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the nonfederal entity’s fiscal year in federal\nawards must have a single audit conducted in accordance with §200.514 “Scope of audit,” except when\nit elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. An\nauditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or a vendor. Specifically, “Federal awards expended as a recipient\nor a subrecipient are subject to audit under §200.501, Subpart F.”\nSAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute,\nin effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA\naudit is to express opinions on the grantee’s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major\ngrant programs, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address\nspecific compliance issues with respect to COPS Office grant requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part,\nfederal agencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in §200.338 “Remedies\nfor noncompliance.” These sanctions under §200.338 “Remedies for noncompliance” could include the\nfollowing:\n• Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or\nmore severe enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. • Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost\nof the activity or action not in compliance. • Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the federal award. • Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 CFR part 180 and federal\nawarding agency regulations (or, in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding\nbe initiated by a federal awarding agency). • Withhold further federal awards for the project or program.\n• Take other remedies that may be legally available. Your SAA reports should not be sent to the COPS Office. If the U.S. Department of Justice is your cognizant\nfederal agency (see the Glossary of Terms on page 64), they should be sent to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse\nat: 35 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual Federal Audit Clearinghouse\nBureau of Census\n1201 East 10th Street\nJeffersonville, IN 47132\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) serves as the liaison between grantees and\nauditors in the conduct of resolving and closing SAA audits. Questions and comments regarding SAA audits\nmay be directed to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770."
