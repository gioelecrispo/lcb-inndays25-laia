Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, recipients are required to ensure that federal funds are not given to parties that are\ndebarred or suspended from participation in federal assistance programs. This is to protect the public interest\nand to ensure proper management and integrity in federal activities by conducting business only with\nresponsible parties.

What you should do: If, under a COPS Office award, you enter into a contract for goods or services for $25,000 or more or any\nsubaward, you must verify that the vendor or subrecipient and their respective principals (e.g., owners, top\nmanagers) with whom you intend to do business are not excluded or disqualified from participation in federal\nassistance programs.
