The appropriate Cost Center Manager is responsible for funds\nallotted to special inmate benefit programs. Operating funds for overtime, uniform allowances, inmate pay for Commissary workers, incentive\nawards, supplies directly related to Commissary operations, and Commissary resale items are\nnormally computed using equity formulas. Modifications to these funding levels and funds for\nadditional object classes are submitted using a Budget Development and Execution Requirement\nform (BP-A0183) and a Budget Requirements form (BP-A0184) or other budget form the\ninstitution uses. The Budget Execution Manual provides instructions for completing these\nforms. The Regional Trust Fund Administrator consolidates institution annual requests, including salary\nrequests, and submits them to the Chief, Trust Fund Branch. (2) Salaries and Positions. The Chief, Trust Fund Branch, allots approved Trust Fund\npositions through the Budget Execution process. Positions are normally allotted to institutions\nbased on an equity formula. Requests for Trust Fund positions are routed through the Regional\nTrust Fund Administrator to the Chief, Trust Fund Branch, for approval. Funds from the Trust\nFund Appropriation are used to fund only the number of authorized Trust Fund positions. At no\ntime may Trust Fund funds be expended for the regular salary of any positions exceeding the\nnumber authorized. (3) Equipment Requirements.
