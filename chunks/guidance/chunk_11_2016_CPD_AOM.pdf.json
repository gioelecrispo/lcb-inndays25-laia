Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable\njustification for delays will be granted no-cost extensions. Extension requests must be received prior to the end date of\nthe award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. When justified, the COPS Office will seek to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed. Requests to extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before\nthe official award end date. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension before the award end date\nmay result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. Please note that the project period of performance will be extended, if necessary, until the deliverable is\nconsidered final. If the award is set to expire, prior to the final approval of the deliverable, a no-cost extension\nwill be executed for a reasonable amount of time for the recipient to complete the final deliverable. 9 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nAward modifications under the Community Policing Development program are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in\naccordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.308. For federal awards in excess of $150,000, any modification request involving the\nreallocation of funding between budget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of the total\napproved budget requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award amount or\nbudget modification percentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In addition,\nany budget modification that changes the scope of the project requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you are required to expend\nfederal funds only as approved in the FCM. Requests to change or alter an award that meet certain threshold\nrequirements must be submitted to the COPS Office for written approval, prior to their purchase or\nimplementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it was originally\noutlined and accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within the\noriginal scope of the award. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved."
