  "chunk_text": "Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) for your award is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after\nthe end date of the award period. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal\nexpenditures that were incurred during the life of the award (as stated in the OMB Uniform Guidance 2 CFR\n§200.77 Period of performance), as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. In addition, once\nyou have completed your final drawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of federal funds\ndrawn down by your agency. The final SF-425 report should also reflect the total amount of the local cash match (if required) contributed over\nthe 36-month award period, which should be at least 25 percent of the total award project, unless waived by the\nCOPS Office in writing. The federal funds expended should reflect only the actual allowable incurred salary and\nfringe benefit costs for the 36-month award period that each award position was occupied. When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency has incurred but not\nyet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the award period to request reimbursement for funds\nobligated. Please be advised that 2 CFR §200.343(a) requires recipients to submit final SF-425s and 2 CFR § 200.343(b) requires\nrecipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of the award. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period following award\nexpiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess award funds remaining in your account following the award\nperiod due to an overestimate of item costs during the award period. Your agency should review its records\ncarefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred during\nthe award period. Any excess unobligated or unspent funds should remain in your account, and will be\ndeobligated during the closeout process. Final Program Progress (Closeout) Report After your award period has ended, your agency may be sent a final progress or closeout report from the COPS\nOffice and asked to complete it. This report will serve as your agency’s final programmatic report on the award,\nand the information your agency provides in this report will be used to make a final assessment of your award\nprogress. 48 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual Equipment disposition\nEach recipient must use any equipment funded through a COPS Office award for approved award-related\npurposes and must retain the equipment for the life of the award.
