Please note that\npart of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement executive or government\nexecutive or other financial points of contact to validate information provided by the Drawdown Specialist. If you are already registered for a COPS Office grant username in GPRS and would like to add a newly\nawarded COPS Office grant to the existing COPS Office grant username, contact the COPS Office GPRS\nregistration team via e-mail at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information:\n• User name (for COPS Office grants)\n• First/last name\n• Vendor number\n• Grant number(s) to be added How do we fill out the payment enrollment forms? If you are a new grantee to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on\nthe COPS Office website at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=100. Prior to accessing your grant funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 7th Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 31 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner’s Manual Your agency must complete the “Payee/Company Information” section following the directions on the\nback of the form and also provide the grant number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial\ninstitution must complete the “Financial Institution Information” section and have the appropriate financial\nofficial sign the form. If you are already a COPS Office grantee, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the newly awarded\ngrant as long as your OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your\nACH enrollment form information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you\nare required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able\nto make drawdowns from your grant account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on\nfile with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Grantees are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via\nthe Internet at www.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see section VI of this\nGrant Owner’s Manual, titled “Reports,” on page 38. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that\ncalendar quarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of “minimum cash on hand” applies to COPS Office grants."
