  "chunk_text": "Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding\nfor costs incurred beyond the official grant award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks\nto accommodate reasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS\nOffice grant. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the grant award period to determine\nwhether a no-cost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the grant\nend date. Requests to extend the grant award period must be submitted online and received by the COPS\nOffice before the official grant award end date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will\nonly be considered when the grantee provides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example\nof this would be an instance where an unforeseen natural disaster prevented a grantee from requesting\nan extension. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension by the end date may result in the\nimmediate deobligation of any remaining grant funds. 9 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner’s Manual Automatic extensions will be granted for grantee requests of six months or less. All extension requests\nbeyond six months will require review and approval by the COPS Office. Individual or cumulative requests\ngreater than one-half of the grant’s original term (i.e., 12 months) will require additional justification and\nmust include a detailed timeline. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the grant due to salary and fringe benefits costs that\nwere lower than anticipated, your agency cannot extend the 24-month funding period for the purpose of\nexpending those excess funds. Grantees are entitled to a maximum of 24 months of federal funding based\non the approved salary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining\ngrant funds during the closeout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time\nextension, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency’s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS AntiGang Initiative award. Grant modifications under CAGI are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All modification\nrequests involving the purchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their\nimplementation. In addition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that\nresults in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram grant funds. Acceptable examples of such\naward modifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items,\nor purchasing a different type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may\nexpend grant funds only as approved in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Any requests to change or\nalter grant awards require written approval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Without\nprior written approval, you must continue to implement your grant as it was originally awarded and\naccepted by your agency. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved (construction, indirect costs, etc.)."
