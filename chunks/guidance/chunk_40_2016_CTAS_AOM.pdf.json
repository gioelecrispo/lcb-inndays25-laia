  "chunk_text": "For example, recipients\nwho have budgeted local funds to pay for a new computer system may not reallocate those funds to pay for\nany other law enforcement cost as a result of receiving TRGP-E/T funds for the same computer system. Any training covered by TRGP-E/T funds is in addition to the number of hours of training already provided\nby your agency. Funds currently allocated for training may not be reallocated to other purposes. Note: This award condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your\nagency under this award. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any partner agencies use COPS Office\nfunds only to supplement, not supplant, their state, local, or BIA funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 36 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated on a caseby-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted no-cost\nextensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays, or other\ncircumstances that interrupt the 36 month award funding period. An extension allows your agency to compensate for\nsuch delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding. Extension requests must be\nreceived prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. 39 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the award end date. Requests\nto extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before the official award end date. Extension\nrequests received after the expiration date will be considered only when the recipient provides justification of\nextraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance in which an unforeseen natural disaster\nprevented a recipient from requesting an extension. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension by\nthe end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency’s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS Office\nTRGP Equipment/Training award. Award modifications under TRGP Equipment/Training are evaluated on a case-bycase basis. All modification requests involving the purchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the\nCOPS Office prior to their implementation."
