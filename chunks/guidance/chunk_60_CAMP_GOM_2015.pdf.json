Strategies and programs can be assessed for\nprocess, outcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered\nduring analysis should be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be\ndeveloped and tested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those aspects that could have an impact on them—for\nexample, capable guardians for victims, handlers for offenders, and managers for locations. Rather than\naddressing root causes of a problem, the police focus on the factors that are within their reach, such as\nlimiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating risk with\nunwanted behavior. Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between the law enforcement agency and the\nindividuals and organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. • other government agencies\n• community members/groups\n• nonprofits/service providers\n• private businesses 52 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual • media\nCommunity policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages\ninteractive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems\nthrough collaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in\nprioritizing public safety problems. Other government agencies\nLaw enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies,\nhealth and human services, child support, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members/groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community—volunteers, activists, formal\nand informal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters—are a valuable resource\nfor identifying community concerns. Partnerships with these factions of the community can engage\nthe community in achieving specific goals at town hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings,\ndecentralized offices or storefronts in the community, and team beat assignments. Nonprofits / service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncertain interests and can include such entities as victims’ groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups,\nadvocacy groups, and the faith community. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners\nbecause they often bring considerable resources to bear on problems of mutual concern. Businesses can\nhelp identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security apparatus\nand community outreach. The local chamber of commerce can also assist in disseminating information\nabout police and business partnerships and initiatives. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community."
