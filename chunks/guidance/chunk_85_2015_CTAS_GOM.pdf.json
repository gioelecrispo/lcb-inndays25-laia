  "chunk_text": "Decentralized decision-making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in\ncommunity policing. When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she\nultimately feels accountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of\nthe community. Decentralized decision-making involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing\ntolerance for risk-taking in problem-solving efforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In\naddition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various resources to attack a problem and allowing\nofficers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community will help define problems and develop\npossible solutions. 74 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide\ncommitment to community policing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and\nexpertise. If a strategic plan is to have value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it\nand be able to give examples of their efforts supporting the plan. Components such as the organization’s\nmission and values statement should be simple and communicated widely. Policies Community policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to\nensure that community policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem\nsolving and partnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding\nsets of procedures, where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response\ntimes, tickets issued, and crime rates), community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome\nmeasures to include such things as greater community satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of\nproblems, and improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to\nevaluation—one that looks at how feedback information is used, not only how outcomes are measured. Transparency Community policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional\npolicing. If the community is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing\nrelevant information on crime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local\npatrol officers have decision-making authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved\nthrough long-term assignments, the development of officers who are generalists and using special units\nappropriately. Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment\nof officers to specific neighborhoods or areas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance customer\nservice and facilitate more contact between police and citizens, thus establishing a strong relationship\nand mutual accountability. Beat boundaries should correspond to neighborhood boundaries and other\ngovernment services should recognize these boundaries when coordinating government public-service\nactivities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers have to be able to handle multiple\nresponsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the\ncommunity. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just in special units, although\nthere may be a need for some specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly\ncomplex problems or managing complex partnerships."
