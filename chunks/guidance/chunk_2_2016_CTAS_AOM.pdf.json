  "chunk_text": "In Fiscal Year 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a single Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation\n(CTAS) that encompassed the department’s available Tribal Government–specific award programs. CTAS\nenabled each tribe to submit a single application for available award funding according to the tribes’ needs. This\ncoordinated process allowed the DOJ to review a single application from a tribe, and it allowed the DOJ awardmaking components to coordinate in making award decisions to address these public safety needs on a more\ncomprehensive basis. The 2016 TRGP, which is also CTAS Purpose Area #1: Public Safety and Community Policing, consists of two types\nof awards. The TRGP-Hiring awards are for entry-level salaries and benefits for newly hired or rehired career law\nenforcement officers, and the TRGP-Equipment/Training (TRGP-E/T) awards provide funding for background\ninvestigations, training, uniforms, basic issue equipment, technology, and vehicles for tribal law enforcement\nagencies. To support community policing, particularly the development of partnerships and problem solving, 2016 TRGP\nrecipients may be offered training and technical assistance by COPS Office training and technical assistance\nproviders. Trainings will assist recipients in the advancement of community policing and may address specific\npublic safety issues facing tribal communities. The COPS Office or its technical assistance providers will notify\nTRGP recipients about training and technical assistance opportunities. Recipients are encouraged to participate\nin the training and technical assistance opportunities to further their public safety efforts. This COPS Office TRGP Award Owner’s Manual will assist your agency with the administrative and financial\nmatters associated with managing your award.
