They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community\nagencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on\npublic perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how\nthe infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages\nthe application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the\nentire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem\nsolving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and\ncommunication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing’s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of doing business. 96 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part\nof the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor\ngroups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing\nimplementation. Decision making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision-making. Decentralized\ndecision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision\nmaking involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving\nefforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate\nvarious resources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the\ncommunity will help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise."
