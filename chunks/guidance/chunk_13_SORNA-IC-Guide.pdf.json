Juvenile Offenders and SORNA\nSORNA requires that jurisdictions register\njuveniles convicted as adults as well as\njuveniles adjudicated delinquent of certain\nserious sex offenses. A common misconception is that SORNA\nrequires jurisdictions to register all\njuveniles who are adjudicated delinquent\nfor sex offenses. In fact, SORNA requires\njuvenile registration only if the juvenile\nwas at least 14 years old at the time\nof the offense and was adjudicated\ndelinquent for committing (or attempting\nor conspiring to commit) a sexual act\n(generally speaking, a forcible penetration\noffense) with another by force, by the\nthreat of serious violence, or by rendering\nunconscious or drugging the victim. Exceptions for Juveniles\nSORNA does not require jurisdictions\nto treat their juvenile sex offenders\nthe same as adult registrants in all\nrespects. Jurisdictions have the\ndiscretion to exempt juveniles from\ntheir public sex offender website. Jurisdictions can also establish\ndifferent procedures for juveniles\nthat recognize the unique needs\nof juvenile offenders. For more\ninformation, see the Attorney\nGeneral’s Supplemental Guidelines\nfor Juvenile Registration (https://\nsmart.ojp.gov/sorna/currentlaw#Attorney). Because of the severity of these offenses,\njuvenile sex offenders adjudicated\ndelinquent are categorized as tier III offenders under SORNA and are subject to duration\nand in-person verification requirements applicable to all tier III offenders. Although SORNA requires registration for juveniles adjudicated delinquent of certain\nsex offenses, SORNA allows registration to be terminated after 25 years for those who\nmaintain a clean record. Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country | 19 International Travel Notice Information\nSORNA* requires that a registered sex\noffender inform their residence jurisdiction\nof any intended travel outside of the United\nStates at least 21 days prior to that travel. The residence jurisdiction must then notify\nthe U.S. Marshals Service’s National Sex\nOffender Targeting Center (USMS-NSOTC)\nwith the intended travel information. The\nresidence jurisdiction must also update\nNCIC/NSOR. The other information-sharing\nrequirements of SORNA apply to this\ninformation as well. Jurisdictions must collect the following\ninformation regarding a registered sex\noffender’s intended international travel:\nl Identifying Information\n— Full primary given name\n— All aliases, nicknames and\npseudonyms\n— Date of birth\n— Sex\n— Citizenship\n— Passport number and country\n— FBI number (for domestic law\nenforcement use only) l Travel Information\n— Destination(s)\n• Dates and places of departure,\narrival and return (if applicable),\nincluding the name of the point\nof departure (city/town) from\neach country Advance Notice\nUnlike notification requirements for\ntemporary domestic lodging, sex\noffenders are required to inform their\njurisdiction of all international travel\n— regardless of trip length — at least\n21 days in advance of their trip. How To Notify the U.S. Marshals\nJurisdictions are strongly\nencouraged to make this\nnotification by way of the\n“Notification of International Travel\nForm” on the SORNA Exchange\nPortal. See “SORNA Exchange\nPortal,” page 17. As an alternative,\njurisdictions may directly submit\nthe “Notification of International\nTravel Form” to the USMS-NSOTC\nat IOD. NSOTC@usdoj.gov, with a\nsubject line of “Sex Offender Travel\nNotification.”"
