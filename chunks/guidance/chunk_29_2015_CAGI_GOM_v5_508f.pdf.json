  "chunk_text": "EEOPs do not impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization’s legal status,\nthe number of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization has fewer than 50 employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the\nEEOP requirement. To claim the exemption, your organization must complete and submit Section A of the\nCertification Form, which is available online at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/pdfs/cert.pdf. If your organization is a government agency or private business and receives an award of $25,000 or more,\nbut less than $500,000, and has 50 or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees\nbut excluding political appointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report (formerly called an EEOP\nShort Form), but it does not need to submit the report to the OCR for review. Instead, your organization\nmust maintain the Utilization Report on file and make it available for review on request. In addition, your\norganization must complete Section B of the Certification Form and return it to the OCR. The Certification\nForm is available at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/pdfs/cert.pdf. 14 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner’s Manual If your organization is a government agency or private business and has received an award for $500,000 or\nmore and has 50 or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but excluding political\nappointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report (formerly called an EEOP Short Form) and submit it\nto the OCR for review within 60 days from the date of this letter. For assistance in developing a Utilization\nReport, please consult the OCR’s website at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm. In addition, your\norganization has to complete Section C of the Certification Form and return it to the OCR. The Certification\nForm is available at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/pdfs/cert.pdf. To comply with the EEOP requirements, you may request technical assistance from an EEOP specialist at the\nOCR by telephone at (202) 307-0690, by TTY at (202) 307-2027, or by e-mail at EEOsubmisson@usdoj.gov. 12. Contracts and/or MOUs with other jurisdictions\nCondition:\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, sworn law enforcement officer positions and civilian positions, awarded\nmay only be used for law enforcement activities or services that exclusively benefit your agency/task force and the\npopulation that it serves. The items funded under the CAGI grant cannot be utilized by other agencies/task forces\nunless the items would exclusively benefit the population that your agency/task force serves. Why this condition: The CAGI grant is intended to benefit the communities within the grantee’s primary law enforcement\njurisdiction. Therefore, the grantee must use the CAGI grant funding to benefit its own population\nexclusively, rather than contracting out the COPS Office-funded officer(s) to other jurisdictions. What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the CAGI grant cannot provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies\nunless they will directly benefit the grantee’s jurisdiction."
