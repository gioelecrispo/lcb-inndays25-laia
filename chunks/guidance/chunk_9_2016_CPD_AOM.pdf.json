  "chunk_text": "In addition, items that have a direct correlation to the overall\nsuccess of a recipient’s project objectives and are necessary for the project to reach full implementation will be\nconsidered on a case-by-case basis by the COPS Office. For recipients that are state, local, or tribal government entities, requests may be made only for items or\npositions that are not otherwise budgeted with state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds and would not\nbe funded in the absence of the CPD award. If at any time you are unsure if an item is considered allowable or unallowable, please contact your COPS Office\nProgram Manager for further assistance. Indirect costs\nIndirect (facilities and administrative, or F&A) costs are costs incurred for a common or joint purpose that are not\nreadily assignable to a particular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance\nof the project. Indirect costs are allowable for this program, but must adhere to the standards set forth in the\napplicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance as stated in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 (Uniform 7 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards) as adopted by the\nU.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. § 2800.101. Examples of indirect costs include those incurred for facility\noperation and maintenance, depreciation, and administrative salaries. Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency carefully track\nand update its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office award period. The recipient understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of application,\nit will be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a current indirect cost\nrate agreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the award prohibiting the\nobligation, expenditure, or drawdown of funds for reimbursement for indirect costs until a current indirect cost\nrate has been approved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS Office. If your agency’s approved indirect cost rate expires during the award period, a current approved rate must be\nsubmitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down award funding for indirect costs. Your expired\nrate must be renegotiated or extended by your cognizant federal agency. An approved indirect cost rate may be\nextended one time for up to four years, and once the cognizant federal agency has approved your extension,\nyou must abide by that rate for the agreed-upon time period. At the end of the extension period, you must\nrenegotiate a new indirect cost rate. Your agency must advise the COPS Office in writing of any changes to your\napproved indirect cost rate during the award period and must request a budget modification with the COPS\nOffice to reflect any rate change."
