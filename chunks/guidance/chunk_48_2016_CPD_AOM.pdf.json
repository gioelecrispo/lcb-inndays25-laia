How do we add an award to an existing GPRS account? If you are currently registered for a COPS Office award username in GPRS and would like to add a recently\nawarded COPS Office award to the existing COPS Office award username, contact the COPS Office GPRS\nregistration team via e-mail at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information:\n•\n•\n•\n• User name (for COPS Office awards) First/last name\nVendor number (as listed on your award document)\nAward number(s) to be added 49 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual How do we fill out the payment enrollment forms? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated Clearinghouse\n(ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on the COPS Office\nwebsite at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf. Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 Your agency must complete the “Payee/Company Information” section following the directions on the back of\nthe form and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial institution\nmust complete the “Financial Institution Information” section and have the appropriate financial official sign the\nform. If you are already a COPS Office award recipient, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long as\nyour OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment\nform information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Staff Accountant. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you are\nrequired to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFRs) using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able to\nmake drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the\nCOPS Office by the deadline date. Awardees are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at\nhttps://portal.cops.usdoj.gov/. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see section VII of this\nmanual, titled “Reports,” on page 58. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. 50 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual Additional payment questions Can we receive advances?
