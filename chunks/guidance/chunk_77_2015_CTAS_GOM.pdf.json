When the Grant Period Has Ended At the end of your agency’s TRGP grant period, the COPS Office is responsible for the closeout of your grant. As part of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation demonstrating that your agency has met all\nof the programmatic and financial requirements of the grant. After the end of the grant period, your agency will be asked to submit a final FFR and any applicable final\nprogram reports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final FFR (SF-425) for your grant is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after the end date of the\ngrant. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal expenditures that were incurred\nduring the life of the grant, as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. In addition, once\nyou have completed your final drawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of funds\ndrawn down by your agency. When should all of the grant monies be spent? Grant funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the grant period. Obligated funds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency\nhas incurred but not yet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the grant period to request\nreimbursement for funds obligated. Please be advised that 2 C.F.R. Part 200.343(a) requires grantees to submit final SF-425s and 2 C.F.R. Part 200.343(b)\nrequires grantees to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration\nof the grant. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess grant funds remaining in your account following the grant\nperiod due to an overestimate of item costs during the grant period. Your agency should review its records\ncarefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred\nduring the grant period. Any excess unobligated or unspent funds should remain in your account, and will\nbe deobligated during the closeout process. Final Program Progress (Closeout) Report After your grant period has ended, your agency may be sent a final progress or closeout report from the\nCOPS Office and asked to complete it. This report will serve as your agency’s final programmatic report on\nthe grant, and the information your agency provides in this report will be used to make a final assessment of\nyour grant progress."
