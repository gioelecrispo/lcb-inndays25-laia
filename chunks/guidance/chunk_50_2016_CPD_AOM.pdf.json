Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for\nthe funds awarded. As required by 2 CFR. § 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your\naccounting system should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the\nfollowing objectives for federal awards:\n•\n•\n• Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency’s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your CPD award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your CPD award (including payroll, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, and purchase order) must be retained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 CFR §200.333 (Retention requirements for\nrecords). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever\nyou find more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving these records has\nbeen started before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These records should be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage."
