For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting requirements,\nplease see Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register, www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-201009-14/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 20 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual 18. Criminal intelligence systems\nCondition:\nGrantees using CAMP funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. The grantee acknowledges that it has completed, signed, and submitted\nwith its grant award the relevant Special Condition certifying its compliance with 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R.\nPart 23. An inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system that receives,\nstores, analyzes, and exchanges or disseminates data regarding on-going pre-arrest criminal activities\n(examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking,\ngambling, extortion, smuggling, bribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law\nenforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23 contains operating principles for these inter-jurisdictional criminal\nintelligence systems which protect individual privacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use COPS Anti Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) grant funds simply to operate a single\nagency database (or other unrelated forms of technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with\nother jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not apply to this grant. What you should do:\nAll COPS Office grant recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence\nSystems/28 C.F.R. Part 23 as part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies\nintend to use their award funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency\nintends to use grant funds to operate an inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should indicate\nthis on the Criminal Intelligence Systems 28 C.F.R. Part 23 Compliance form that was included with your\ngrant award package, and certify and submit this form along with your signed grant award document as\nyour agency’s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Your agency\nnow must comply with 28 C.F.R. Part 23 in operating the inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system\nfunded through your COPS Office grant. 19. Sole source justification\nCondition:\nCAMP awardees who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group of items) or service in\nexcess of $150,000 and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement process must provide\na written sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating, expending, or drawing down\naward funds for that item or service. Why this condition: In general, award recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in some instances, awardees may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do:"
