See\nthe current Program Statement Correctional Services Manual. ■ Dental/surgical instruments cannot be handled as Class B tools; they are not engraved or\nstored on a shadowboard. Instruments will be stored in their sterile packages in a way that\ndoes not compromise the pack’s inte rit and the sterilit of the contents. In the event of\npackaging of multiple instruments together (e.g., an operative setup), the inventories indicate\nhow many and which instruments are in the package. ■ Written inventories (ex: scalpels) are maintained with a method to document/prove\naccountability. The method and frequency of accountability will be established and may\nvary depending on the specific mission or needs of the institution. This protocol will be in\nthe local Institution Supplement.\n■ The inventory of surplus/bulk dental instruments should be verified on a quarterly basis. ■ Access to areas where dental instruments are kept should be limited to Dental\nStaff/contractors, HSA, CD, and supervised inmates. Inmates are not allowed in the dental\nclinic without staff supervision. All dental staff are responsible for supervising inmates and\nwill conduct pat searches as needed. See the current Program Statement Searches of\nHousing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas. ■ Polic /procedures must be developed with uidance from the institution’s Computer Services\nManager for computer and information security. ■ Consult the RCD when developing security measures in the Dental Clinic.
