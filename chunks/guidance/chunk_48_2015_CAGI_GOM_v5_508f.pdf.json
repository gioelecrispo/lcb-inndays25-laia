(If applicable, any salary and benefit costs higher\nthan entry-level must be paid by your agency with local funds.) Please note: If the total cost of allowable\nitems exceeds the approved budget, then the additional expenditures are encouraged to be reported\non line 10j of the SF-425 as recipient share of expenditures. 33 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner’s Manual IV. Financial Record Maintenance Under the COPS Office CAGI grant, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems\nand financial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include\nboth federal funds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately\naccount for the funds awarded. As stated in 2 C.F.R. 200.62 (Internal Control over Compliance Requirements for Federal Awards), your\naccounting system should\n• present and itemize actual expenditures of funded items;\n• demonstrate that funds are spent in compliance with your grant conditions;\n• be able to provide the necessary information for periodic financial review and audit. What records must be kept? Your agency’s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and\ncomplete disclosure of the financial activity under your CAGI grant. Your accounting records should contain\ninformation showing expenditures under the grant and must be supported by items such as payroll records,\ntime and attendance records, cancelled checks, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard grant funds and make sure that they are used for authorized\npurposes only. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must documents be kept? All financial records, including payroll, time and attendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, and\nsimilar documents associated with your CPD award should be kept for at least three years from the date\nthe COPS Office officially closes the award. Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify\nthem by grant year or by fiscal year, whichever you find more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation,\naudit or other action involving these records has been started before the end of the three-year period, the\nrecords should be kept until completion of the action. These records should be easily located and should\nbe properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to maintain adequate records to document award\nexpenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds that cannot be supported with appropriate\nrecords. Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by grant year or by fiscal year, whichever\nyou find more convenient. What if we have more than one grant?"
