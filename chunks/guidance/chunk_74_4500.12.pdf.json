PROCESSING INMATE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM\n(IFRP) PAYMENTS\n11.1 GENERAL This chapter establishes procedures for processing automated and manual payments in TRUFACS\nfor IFRP through SENTRY. IFRP was developed to encourage sentenced inmates to satisfy\ncourt-ordered financial obligation(s). Inmates receive help from Unit Management staff to\ndevelop a financial plan to satisfy these obligation(s). The SENTRY IFRP Module facilitates processing procedures for payments made on behalf of\ninmates who have court-ordered financial obligation(s). It allows tracking of financial data\nentered into the SENTRY database. TRUFACS automates IFRP withdrawals, SENTRY\ntransmission, and processing of the Business Disbursements and Excess Withdrawal transactions. Unit Management staff enter the appropriate data into SENTRY for all inmates with a financial\nobligation. The stored information is updated monthly or quarterly after OFM/Trust Fund staff\nprocess payments, or when the inmate changes participation status, or as necessary for a change in\na financial obligation. The Trust Fund Branch transmits the payment data and funds to the\nappropriate component. 11.2 OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY The Chief, Trust Fund Branch, has oversight of IFRP payments and ensures that the IFRP data\ntransmitted to outside components is accurate and timely. If errors are detected in the data or\nIPAC amounts each institution processes, Deposit Fund staff contact the institution and request\ncorrective action. After reconciliation, the Trust Fund Branch transfers the funds to the appropriate component(s),\nauthorizes SENTRY to release the IFRP data file to the component, and generates reports. Each\ninstitution ensures the accuracy of data they process and promptly corrects errors identified by\nDeposit Fund staff. 11.3 ACRONYMS AND SENTRY IFRP TERMINOLOGY\na. Financial Obligation.
