One aspect of this growth is\nevidenced by the increase in Federal offenders housed in nonFederal facilities. In addition, innovative programs such as\ncommunity-based drug treatment and sanction centers have been\nestablished or expanded. Staff members must be skilled in a number of areas to accommodate\nthe various demands of the community corrections field. Contract\ndevelopment and administration, inmate management, public\nrelations, personnel management, financial management and project\nmanagement are all areas in which staff must be proficient. 1.2 MISSION STATEMENT The mission of community corrections is to provide programs and\nfacilities for Federal offenders serving their sentences in\nnon-Bureau facilities, and to play an instrumental role in\ndesignating Bureau and non-Bureau facilities for placement of\noffenders. Community corrections staff:\nDevelop and manage contract residential resources that\nprovide:\n! (1)\npre-release assistance for inmates who are nearing\ntheir release date,\n(2)\nan option to institutional confinement for certain\nshort-term offenders and,\n(3)\na structured environment for certain probationers,\nparolees, and supervised releasees who need more assistance\nand supervision than can be provided by community\nsupervision."
