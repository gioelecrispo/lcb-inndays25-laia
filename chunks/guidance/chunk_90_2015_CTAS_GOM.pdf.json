  "chunk_text": "It also protects against most other factory loads in caliber .357 Magnum and\n9mm as well as the Type I and II-A threats. Type III-A (.44 Magnum; submachine gun 9mm) Type III-A body armor provides the highest level of protection currently available from concealable body\narmor and is generally suitable for routine wear in many situations. However, departments located in hot,\nhumid climates may need to evaluate the use of Type III-A armor carefully. This armor protects against .44 Magnum lead semi-wadcutter bullets with gas checks, nominal masses of\n15.55 g (240 gr), impacting at a velocity of 426 m/s (1,400 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against\nmost handgun threats as well as the Type I, II-A, and II threats. Type III (high-powered rifle) Type III body armor is clearly intended only for tactical situations when the threat warrants such protection,\nsuch as barricade confrontations involving sporting rifles. This armor, normally of hard or semi-rigid construction, protects against 7.62 mm full-metal jacketed bullets\n(U.S. military designation M80), with nominal masses of 9.7 g (150 gr), impacting at a velocity of 838 m/s\n(2,750 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against threats such as 223 Remington (5.56 mm FMJ), 30\nCarbine FMJ, and 12-gauge rifled slug, as well as the Type I through III-A threats. 79 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Type IV (armor-piercing rifle) Type IV body armor provides the highest level of protection currently available. Because this armor is intended\nto resist armor piercing bullets, it often uses ceramic materials. Such materials are brittle in nature and may\nprovide only single-shot protection, since the ceramic tends to break up when struck. As with Type III armor,\nType IV armor is clearly intended only for tactical situations when the threats warrant such protection. This armor protects against .30-06 caliber armor-piercing bullets (U.S. military designation AMP2), with\nnominal masses of 10.8 g (166 gr), impacting at a velocity of 868 m/s (2,850 ft/s) or less. It also provides at\nleast single-hit protection against the Type I through III threats. Special type\nA purchaser who has a special requirement for a level of protection other than one of the above standard\nthreat levels should specify the exact test rounds and minimum impact velocities to be used and indicate\nthat this standard shall govern in all other respects.
