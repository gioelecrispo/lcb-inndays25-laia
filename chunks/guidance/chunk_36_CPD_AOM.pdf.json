  "chunk_text": "The subaward information entered\nin FSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov associated with your agency’s award, furthering\nfederal spending transparency. For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting requirements,\nplease see Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register, www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-201009-14/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 25. Federal civil rights laws As a condition of receipt of federal financial assistance, you acknowledge and agree that you will not (and will\nrequire any subgrantees, contractors, successors, transferees, and assignees not to), on the ground of race, color,\nreligion, national origin (which includes providing limited English proficient persons meaningful access to your\nprograms), sex, disability or age, unlawfully exclude any person from participation in, deny the benefits of or 23 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual employment to any person, or subject any person to discrimination in connection with any programs or activities\nfunded in whole or in part with federal funds. These civil rights requirements are found in the nondiscrimination\nprovisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. § 2000d); the Omnibus Crime Control and\nSafe Streets Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. § 3789d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended\n(29 U.S.C. § 794); the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101, et seq.); Title IX of the Education Amendments\nof 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.); and the corresponding DOJ regulations implementing those\nstatutes at 28 C.F.R. Part 42 (subparts C, D, E, G, and I). You also agree to comply with Executive Order 13279 Equal\nTreatment for Faith-Based Organizations and its implementing regulations at 28 C.F.R. Part 38, which requires\nequal treatment of religious organizations in the funding process and nondiscrimination of beneficiaries by FaithBased Organizations on the basis of belief or nonbelief. Why this condition: In establishing financial assistance programs, Congress linked the receipt of federal funding to compliance\nwith federal civil rights laws. As a result, awardees are required to comply with the civil rights requirements\nfound in the non-discrimination provisions referenced above. A hold may be placed on your award if it is\ndeemed that your agency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an\nongoing federal civil rights investigation. If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate or\ndraw down federal funds under your agency’s COPS Office award until you comply with federal civil rights\nlaws or cooperate with any ongoing federal civil rights investigation. What you should do: As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the\napplicable federal civil rights laws and to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective\nenforcement of such laws and to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes\nproviding access to records, accounts, documents, information, facilities, and staff. 26. Debarment and suspension The recipient agrees not to award Federal funds under this program to any party which is debarred or suspended\nfrom participation in Federal assistance programs."
