See “Establishing a SORNA\nProgram,” page 22. Tribes are encouraged\nto work with states to establish procedures\nfor this SORNA DNA requirement. Note\nthat contracting with a private laboratory is\nnot sufficient for DNA submission for sex\noffender registration purposes because\nmost private laboratories cannot submit\ntheir DNA profiles to CODIS. Eligible tribal jurisdictions may submit DNA\nsamples directly to the FBI’s Federal DNA\nDatabase Unit (FDDU), and the FBI provides\nDNA sample kits to SORNA tribal registration\njurisdictions for free. Once tribes have taken\nand submitted the DNA sample for analysis,\nit can be discarded. There is no need to retain it. How To Check if a DNA Sample\nHas Been Submitted to the FBI\nChecking an offender’s DNA status\nfirst can reduce duplicate testing\nand submissions, saving time and\nresources. To find out if a DNA\nsample for a particular offender\nwas submitted to the FDDU, submit\na status request form at https://\nforms.fbi.gov/fddu-fco-samplestatus. Tribal jurisdictions participating\nin TAP can view an offender’s\nDNA status via their criminal\nhistory record. Near the top of the\ncriminal history record, above the\nbiographical information, there is a\nDNA indicator showing whether a\nDNA profile already exists in CODIS. (This DNA indicator does not show\nwhether DNA has been submitted to\na state laboratory.) Note: It takes 30 days for the DNA\nindicator to be updated in the criminal\nhistory record. If the indicator is\nnegative, submit the status request\nform above to verify if a sample has\nbeen submitted to FDDU. Keep in mind that a sex offender DNA submission could result in a cold hit, and\ncooperation with other agencies — including the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, state and\nlocal law enforcement, and tribal police — may be necessary. The FBI provides DNA sample kits free of charge\nto SORNA tribal registration jurisdictions,\nwhich can be submitted directly to the FDDU. 16 | Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country Ordering Kits and Submitting DNA Samples to the FBI\nDNA kits can be ordered from the FBI\nwebsite at forms.fbi.gov/buccalcollection-kit-re-order-form. For more\ninformation, contact FDDU by email\nat fddu@ic.fbi.gov; phone at 703-6327529; or mail at Federal DNA Database\nUnit, 2501 Investigation Parkway,\nQuantico, VA 22135. Tribal jurisdictions that submit DNA\nsamples directly to the FBI must\ncollect the samples according to the\nFBI’s directions and standards and\ncomplete the required FBI form, which must include, among other items, data\non each sex offender’s conviction and\npersonal information, two fingerprints,\nand valid and verifiable agency contact\ninformation. The procedures for\ncollecting the sample must be followed\ndiligently and must be complete to\nensure that the submission can be\ntested and the data entered into\nCODIS. For more information on how\nto take and submit a DNA sample with\nthe supplied kits, visit www.fbi.gov/\nservices/laboratory/biometric-analysis/\nfederal-dna-database. SORNA Exchange Portal\nSORNA requires jurisdictions to share\ninformation about sex offenders who\nare relocating between jurisdictions or\nare required to register in more than\none jurisdiction. The SMART Office\ndeveloped the SORNA Exchange Portal\nto meet this directive and provide sex\noffender registration personnel an internetbased community where they can share\ninformation. Each registration jurisdiction\nhas access to its own individual site, and\noffender information can be exchanged\nwith other jurisdictions through offender\nrelocation tasks, document and file sharing,\ndiscussion boards, event calendars and a\nhistorical statutes database."
