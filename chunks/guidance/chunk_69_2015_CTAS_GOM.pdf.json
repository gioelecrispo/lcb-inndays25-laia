Your agency should minimize the time between your drawdown of grant funds and your payment of grant\ncosts to avoid earning excess interest on your grant funds. You must account for interest earned on advances\nof federal funds as follows: • COPS grant award recipients must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(9) that states that interest\nearned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year may\nbe retained by the grantee for administrative expense. Interest earned on Federal advance payments\ndeposited in interest-bearing accounts in excess of $500 must be remitted annually to the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Make check payable to “The Department of Health and\nHuman Services” and mail check to Treasury-approved lockbox: HHS Program Support Center, P.O. Box\n530231, Atlanta, GA 30353-0231. (Please allow 4–6 weeks for processing of a payment by check to be\napplied to the appropriate Payment Management System (PMS) account). • Please notify your COPS Office Staff Accountant in the COPS Office Financial Division when any interest\nthat is earned is remitted to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management\nSystems, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. • For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified\nat 31 C.F.R. Part 205 “Rules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers” and TFM 4A–2000\nOverall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies. Matching funds\nUnder the 2015 COPS Office TRGP Programs, no local match is required. The COPS Office is funding 100\npercent of the allowable items approved in your FCM. (Any salary and benefit costs higher than entrylevel must be paid by your agency with local funds.) Please note: If the total cost exceeds the approved\nbudget, then the addition expenditures are encouraged to be reported on the SF-425 as recipient share of\nexpenditures. 56 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual IV.
