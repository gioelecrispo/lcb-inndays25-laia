UNIT RELEASE PREPARATION. The unit release preparation\nphase provides each inmate the opportunity to receive individual\nassistance from his or her unit staff and usually begins in\nearnest when the inmate is between 11 and 13 months from final\nrelease. Unit staff are to evaluate the inmate’s eligibility for\ncommunity-based programs, and are to provide each inmate the\nopportunity to discuss individual concerns prior to release. Final release plans should be developed in direct relationship to\nthose needs. Each institution will establish a list of topics to be discussed\nwith the inmate during the unit release preparation phase. Suggested topics to be discussed include, but are not limited to,\nthe following:\n• CCC process • Disposition of personal property • Disposition of inmate funds • Release plans:\n- • aftercare/conditions of supervision\nrelease destination\nrelocation\nresidence\nemployment\nIFRP Release Processing:\n- gratuity\nclothing\ntransportation\npersonal identification • Release notification • Release registration P5325.07\n12/31/2007\nPage 19\n• Release to detainer (verify with ISM/CCM) Unit staff will enter “RPP UNIT C” into SENTRY when an inmate\ncompletes the Unit RPP. 15. INSTITUTION SUPPLEMENT. To implement this Program\nStatement’s requirements, each Warden must issue an Institution\nSupplement that:\n• Designates an institution Release Preparation Coordinator; • Provides a specific and comprehensive list of courses that\ncomprise the RPP; • Ensures the list of courses are reviewed annually; • Identifies the members of the RPP Committee and the Unit\nstaff member(s) responsible for the Unit Release\nPreparation; • Establishes procedures to identify and approve inmates\neligible to participate in video taped or a modified RPP\nProgram; • Establishes SENTRY course names and group codes; • Establishes the date the annual report is due; and, • Identifies the topics that will be discussed during the unit\nrelease preparation phase. The institution will involve the Regional Office, Correctional\nPrograms Administrator, in developing the Institution Supplement. Care is necessary to ensure that the Institution Supplement’s\npurpose and intent is consistent with the institution's mission. /s/\nKathleen Hawk Sawyer\nDirector P5325.07\n12/31/2007\nAttachment A, Page 1 Sample Course Calendar - Core Topics # 4 - Information/Community\nResources\nCourse Group\nCode Course\nCode Star\nt Role of the\nUSPO and\nSupervision\nRequirements\n(CMC) RN 4 Supervi\nsion 2/5\n6/5\n10/1\n0 Halfway House\nRegulations\n(CMC) RN 4 CCC\nRules State\nEmployment\nServices\n(CMC) RN 4 Social\nSecurity\nResources\n(CMC) M T W T F End Hour\ns 8-10\n8-10\n8-10 2/5\n6/5\n10/1\n0 2\n2\n2 2/5\n6/5\n10/1\n0 10-12\n10-12\n10-12 2/5\n6/5\n10/1\n0 2\n2\n2 State\nSvc 2/5\n6/5\n10/1\n0 1-3\n1-3\n1-3 2/5\n6/5\n10/1\n0 2\n2\n2 RN 4 Social\nSecurit\ny 2/6\n6/6\n10/1\n1 8-10\n8-10\n8-10 2/6\n6/6\n10/1\n1 2\n2\n2 Finding and\nUsing Local\nSocial Service\nAgencies (CMC) RN 4 Local\nSvc 2/6\n6/6\n10/1\n1 1012\n1012\n1012 2/6\n6/6\n10/1\n1 2\n2\n2 Veterans\nAdministration\nAssistance\n(CMC) RN 4 Veteran\ns 2/6\n6/6\n10/1\n1 1-3\n1-3\n1-3 2/6\n6/6\n10/1\n1 2\n2\n2 Housing\nAvailability\n(CMC) RN 4 Housing 2/9\n6/9\n10/1\n4 8-10\n8-10\n8-10 2/9\n6/9\n10/1\n4 2\n2\n2 Legal\nRequirements\n(CMC) RN 4 Legal 2/9\n6/9\n10/1\n4 10-12\n10-12\n10-12 2/9\n6/9\n10/1\n4 2\n2\n2 Food and Money\nAssistance\n(Business\nOffice) RN 4 Food\nMoney 2/9\n6/9\n10/1\n4 1-3\n1-3\n1-3 2/9\n6/9\n10/1\n4 2\n2\n2 P5325.07\n12/31/2007\nAttachment A, Page 2 Sample Course Calendar - Core Topics # 6 - Personal Growth and\nDevelopment\nCourse Group\nCode Course\nCode Star\nt Life Skills\nInformation\n(Counselor) RE 6 Life\nSkill 2/4\n4/8\n8/10\n10/7 Parenting\n(Education) M Parenti\nng 1/12\n6/15 Anger\nManagement\n(Counselor) RN 6 Anger 3/8\n6/9\n9/10\n12/1\n1 Victim\nAwareness\n(Counselor) RN 6 Victim 1/8\n5/15\n9/20 Drug\nEducation\n(Health\nServices) RN 6 Drug Ed 1/11\n4/8\n7/9\n10/1\n0 Marriage\nenrichment\n(Chaplain) RN 6 Marriag\ne 3/4\n5/8\n9/10\n11/7 M T 911:30\n9:11:\n30"
