Restrictions on Internal Confidentiality Agreements\nCondition: No recipient or subrecipient under this award, or entity that receives a contract or subcontract with any funds under\nthis award, may require any employee or contractor to sign an internal confidentiality agreement or statement that\nprohibits or otherwise restricts the lawful reporting of waste, fraud, or abuse to an investigative or law enforcement\nrepresentative of a federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. Why this condition:\nUnder section 743 of Division E, Title VIII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016\n(Pub. L. 114–113), neither the recipient, subrecipient, nor any entity that receives a contract or subcontract with\nany funds under this or any other Act may require its employees or contractors to sign an internal confidentiality\nagreement or statement prohibiting or otherwise restricting their lawful reporting of waste, fraud, or abuse to an\ninvestigative or law enforcement representative of a federal department or agency. This provision protects the\npublic interest and ensures the proper management and use of federal funds. This limitation is not intended,\nand shall not be understood by the agency making this award, to contravene requirements applicable to\nStandard Form 312 (which relates to classified information), Form 4414 (which relates to sensitive\ncompartmented information), or any other form issued by a federal department or agency governing the\nnondisclosure of classified information. What you should do: In accepting this award, the recipient\n• represents that it neither requires nor has required internal confidentiality agreements or statements from\nemployees or contractors that currently prohibit or otherwise restrict (or purport to prohibit or restrict)\nemployees or contractors from reporting waste, fraud, or abuse as described above;\n• represents that, if it learns or is notified that it is or has been requiring its employees or contractors to\nexecute agreements or statements that prohibit or otherwise restrict (or purport to prohibit or restrict),\nreporting of waste, fraud, or abuse as described above, it will immediately stop any further obligations of\naward funds, will provide prompt written notification to the agency making this award, and will resume\nsuch obligations only if expressly authorized to do so by that agency. If the recipient does or is authorized to make subawards or contracts under this award, in accepting, the\nrecipient\n• represents that it has or will determine that no other entity that the recipient proposes may or will receive\naward funds (whether through a subaward, contract, or subcontract) either requires or has required\ninternal confidentiality agreements or statements from employees or contractors that currently prohibit or\notherwise restrict (or purport to prohibit or restrict) employees or contractors from reporting waste, fraud,\nor abuse as described above;\n• represents that it has or will make appropriate inquiry, or otherwise has an adequate factual basis, to\nsupport this representation; 25 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual"
