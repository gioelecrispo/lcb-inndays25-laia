  "chunk_text": "These recipients are also\nrequired to submit to the COPS Office a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the law enforcement\nagency and their school partner(s) before drawing down funds. Additional information about this requirement\nmay be found in appendix E, “Memorandum of Understanding Guidance,” on page 74 of this manual. 31 2016 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner’s Manual 28. Local Match\nCondition:\nRecipients are required to contribute a local match of at least 25 percent toward the total cost of the approved award\nproject, unless waived in writing by the COPS Office. The local match must be a cash match from funds not previously\nbudgeted for law enforcement purposes and must be paid during the award period. The local match contribution\nmust be made on an increasing basis during each year of the three-year award period, with the federal share\ndecreasing accordingly. Why this condition: The 2016 CHP provides up to 75 percent of the allowable costs of this award project (up to a maximum federal\nshare of $125,000 per officer position). Recipients are responsible for providing at least 25 percent of the total\nproject costs in local matching funds. The local match must be a cash match made from local, state, or other\nnon-COPS Office funds. Federal funds (other than COPS Office funds) may be used to meet your local match only\nif the federal funds are authorized by statute for that purpose and approved in writing by both the federal\nagency providing those funds and the COPS Office. What you should do:\nMatching contributions must be made on an increasing basis during each year of the three-year program with\nthe federal share decreasing accordingly. The local match must be paid in full during the active award period;\npayments made prior to the CHP award start date or after the award end date do not qualify as a local match. Recipients are strongly encouraged to pay local match during each quarterly financial reporting period to avoid\npotential noncompliance. If your agency must withdraw from the award period prior to the end of award funding,\nyour agency is responsible for ensuring that the federal share of funds expended is limited to a maximum of 75\npercent of the total program costs expended. If you have questions about the timing of your local match\npayments, please contact your COPS Office Staff Accountant at 800-421-6770. Your agency must maintain records that clearly demonstrate the source of the local match, the amount of the\nlocal match, and when the local match was contributed. The local match must be in addition to funds previously\nbudgeted for specific law enforcement purposes as indicated on your agency’s fiscal year budget. You do not\nneed to provide these supporting documents to the COPS Office, but such records must be produced in the\nevent of an audit, monitoring site visit, or office-based grant review. In addition, recipients are required to report\nthe amount of local match contributed on the quarterly Federal Financial Report (SF-425), line j. Sources for local match requirements may include the following:\n•\n•\n•\n• Nonfederal asset forfeiture funds (subject to approval from the state or local oversight agency);"
