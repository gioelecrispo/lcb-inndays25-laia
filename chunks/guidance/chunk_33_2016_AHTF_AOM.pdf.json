  "chunk_text": "What you should do: An award recipient must request written approval from the COPS Office for sole source procurement in excess of\n$150,000 prior to purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract; or entering\ninto a contract with award funds. For the purchase of equipment, technology, or services under a COPS Office\naward, recipients must use their own documented procurement procedures that reflect applicable state and\nlocal laws and regulations, as long as those requirements conform to the federal procurement requirements set\nforth in 2 CFR § 200.320 as adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 CFR § 2800.101. A sole source 29 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual justification request should be submitted if a recipient determines that the award of a contract through a\ncompetitive process is not feasible. The COPS Office may authorize a noncompetitive proposal if one or more of\nthe following circumstances apply:\n• The item/service is available only from one source. • The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive\nsolicitation. • The COPS Office authorizes noncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the recipient. • Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. The COPS Office will review your request and the supporting information that you provide and will make a\ndetermination as to whether or not an exception can be granted to the general rule regarding competition. If\nsubmitting a sole source justification request to the COPS Office, please use the format described in section II,\n“Procurement Process,” on page 32. For more information on sole source justification, please review the fact sheet: http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2016AwardDocs/Sole_Source_Justification_FactSheet.pdf What are the specific rules regarding termination of award funding? The COPS Office has the right to sanction or terminate your agency’s project when there is reason to believe that\nyour agency is\n•\n•\n•\n• not substantially complying with the award requirements or other applicable provisions of federal law;\nfailing to make satisfactory progress toward the goals or strategies outlined in its application;\nnot adhering to award requirements or conditions;\nproposing substantial plan changes to the extent that, if originally submitted, would have resulted in the\napplication being denied funding;\n• not submitting financial or programmatic reports in a timely manner;\n• filing false statements or certifications in connection with an application, periodic report, or other awardrelated documents;\n• providing other good cause for sanctions or termination as determined by the COPS Office. In these instances, the COPS Office may\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• temporarily withhold payments pending correction of the situation by your agency;\ndisallow all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance;\nwholly or partly suspend or terminate your award;\nrequire that some or all of the award funds be remitted to the U.S. Department of Justice;\ncondition a future award or elect not to provide future award funds to your agency until appropriate\nactions are taken to ensure compliance;\n• withhold or restrict your agency from obtaining future awards;\n• recommend civil or criminal enforcement by other agencies;\n• take other remedies that may be legally available."
