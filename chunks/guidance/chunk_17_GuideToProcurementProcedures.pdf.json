Ceiling on upward adjustment;\ndownward adjustment appropriate\nwhere elements escalated may fall\nbelow base levels provided in contract. Contingencies are industry-wide and\nbeyond contractor control; contingencies\nmust be specifically defined in the\ncontract. Where cost uncertainties exist and there is\nthe possibility of cost reduction and/or\nperformance improvements by giving\ncontractor (i) a degree of cost responsibility\nand (ii) a positive profit incentive. Firm Target Type: Firm target and final profit\nadjustment formula can be negotiated\ninitially. Limitations Adequate Contractor accounting system\nrequired. Must determine that any other\ncontract type is impractical. Used for\ndevelopment and production\nprocurements. Firm Target: Target cost; target profit;\nprice ceiling; and profit adjustment\nformula.

Term Form: Research preliminary\nexploration, or study when level of effort is\ninitially unknown (or development and test\nwhen a CPIF is impractical). -- Impossible to estimate costs firmly. Negotiated estimate of costs; fee fixed\ninitially except for changes in the work\nor services required. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Time and Materials\n(Labor-Hours) Completion Form: Research or other\ndevelopment effort when the task or job can\nbe clearly defined, a definite goal or target\nexpressed, and a specific end product\nrequired. Not possible initially to estimate extent or\nduration of work (L-H used where materials\nnot involved), e.g., engineering or design\nservices, repair, maintenance, or overhaul. Direct labor hours specified at fixed\nhourly rates; direct materials at \"cost.\" Ceiling price shall be established. Determination that no other type of\ncontract is suitable. Non-Federal entities\nmust closely monitor cost\nreimbursement contracts to avoid\nunneeded cost over-runs. Page | 33 Guide to Selection of Contract Types\nType Applicability Essential Elements\nMaximum government liability, type of\ndefinitive contract, as many definitive\ncontract provisions as possible. No other contract type suitable. Letter Contract Exigency requires immediate binding\nagreement so work can begin, but time does\nnot permit negotiation of a definitive\ncontract. State, Tribal, or Local\nContractor Lists Where adequate competition has occurred\nand the product or service offered meets the\nneeds of the project. Follow local/tribal/state regulations. Ensure that state, tribal, or local\ngeographic presences have not been\nused in the procurement evaluation. Exact time of delivery unknown."
