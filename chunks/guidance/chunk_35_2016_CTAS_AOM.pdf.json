Funded background investigations may not be initiated\nprior to the official start date of the award period. 34 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Allowable costs: Training\nBased on the FCM, recipients may have been awarded funding for otherwise unfunded expenses associated with\nsending recruits to a state academy that will train and certify tribal police officers, to the BIA Indian Police\nAcademy in Artesia, New Mexico, or to basic training from an established academy that trains Indian police\nofficers such as the Navajo Nation’s Academy. Basic law enforcement training is encouraged for existing police\nofficers who have not received it, depending on the needs of your department and the availability of funding. Award funding may only be used for one cycle of basic training per officer. The recipient agency will be\nresponsible for any additional costs associated with an officer not completing basic training on the first attempt. TRGP funds may also pay for community policing and problem-solving training; specialized law enforcement\ntraining in such topics as counterterrorism, family violence, and crime prevention and detection; and training\nrelated to Indian Country jurisdictional issues. Only requests for training by recognized training providers such as\nthe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, the FBI, the BIA Indian Police Academy, a state police academy,\nCOPS Office Regional Community Policing Institutes, or a tribal community college will be considered. In\naddition, funding may be used to attend training conferences such as the National Native American Law\nEnforcement Association’s annual training conference or any COPS Office-sponsored conference. Funding for community policing or other law enforcement training will cover only travel, lodging, and per diem\nexpenses for each representative to and from the training site (if training is conducted more than 50 miles from\nyour agency headquarters). State academy training costs include training instruction fees, academy tuition,\ncourse fees, textbooks, manuals, supplies, and travel in connection with the training (transportation, lodging, per\ndiem, etc.) if the training is located more than 50 miles from the job site. If your state academy does not charge\nfor the training, your department will be reimbursed only for travel in connection with the training. Departments\nthat send officers to the BIA Indian Police Academy will be reimbursed for travel costs only, as there is no cost for\ntuition at the BIA Indian Police Academy for tribal officers. TRGP-E/T funds may pay for computer training for systems, hardware, or software that recipients already own\nbut may not be utilizing to the fullest extent due to of a lack of training. Applicants must demonstrate that the\ntraining enhances law enforcement activities, particularly in support of community policing. TRGP-E/T funding\nmay be used only for training costs not already funded in the applicant’s budget with state, local, or BIA funds. In addition, TRGP-E/T funding may be used for off-site training required to increase tribal capacity to operate a\ncrime information gathering system compatible with the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting System. Allowable costs: Uniforms and basic issue equipment"
