Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency\nincluding recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from sworn officers to\ncivilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be aligned with the agencies’\ncommunity policing values. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment,\nselection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving\nresponsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service, not just a spirit of\nadventure. A community policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it looks for recruits, whom it is\nrecruiting and hiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community involvement in\nthis process through the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. 98 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Personnel supervision/evaluations\nSupervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are\nincorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional procedures should support sound\nproblem-solving activities, proactive policing, community collaboration, and citizen satisfaction with police\nservices. Training\nTraining at all levels—academy, field, and in-service—must support community policing principles and tactics. It\nalso needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to identify\nand correct conditions that could lead to crime, raise public awareness, and engage the community in finding\nsolutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving\nand help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized\nwithin the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information technology systems\nCommunity policing is highly information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in providing ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their patrol beat. In\naddition, technological enhancements can greatly assist with accessing information to provide vital resources,\nimproving two-way communication with citizens, and developing agency accountability systems and\nperformance outcome measures. Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the public\nand internally within their organization. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages\nagencies to develop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports; reverse\n911; e-mail alerts; Internet social media discussion forums; and feedback on interactive applications (such as\nsurveys and geographical information), thereby creating open, ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters, e-mail and\nenhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other entities for\nmore efficient operations."
