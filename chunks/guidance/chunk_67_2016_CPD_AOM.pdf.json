Community policing defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of\npartnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to\npublic safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1.\n2.\n3. Community partnerships\nOrganizational transformation\nProblem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the individuals\nand organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages\ninteractive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through\ncollaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and\naddressing public safety problems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools."
