  "chunk_text": "The purpose is to protect the public interest and to ensure proper management in federal activities by\nconducting business with responsible parties. What you should do: If the total value of your active awards, cooperative agreements, and contracts from all federal awarding\nagencies exceeds $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period, then you must ensure that the proceedings\ndescribed in paragraph 2 of this award term that are reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) are\ncurrent. The information about the reported proceedings is made available in SAM via the designated integrity\nand performance system (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System\n(FAPIIS)). During the award period, you must either report for the most recent five year period new information\nabout any proceeding(s) that you have not reported previously or affirm that there is no new information to\nreport. You must also disclose semiannually any information about criminal, civil, and administrative\nproceedings. 27 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual 25. Computer Network Requirement\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees that no award funds may be used to maintain or establish a computer network\nunless such network blocks the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. Nothing in this requirement\nlimits the use of funds necessary for any federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any other entity\ncarrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. Why this condition:\nSection 533 of Division B, Title V, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L.\n114-113) prohibits the use of federal funds to maintain or establish a computer network that does not block the\nviewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. This provision protects the public interest in the proper\nmanagement and use of federal funds. What you should do: The recipient must not use award funds to maintain or establish a computer network unless the network blocks\npornography. This does not limit the use of funds for criminal investigations, prosecution or adjudication\nactivities. 26. Contracts and/or MOUs with Other Jurisdictions\nCondition:\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, sworn law enforcement officer positions and civilian positions, awarded\nmust only be used for law enforcement activities or services that benefit your agency/taskforce and the population\nthat it serves. The items funded under an AHTF award cannot be utilized by other agencies/taskforces unless the items\nbenefit the population that your agency/taskforce serves. Why this condition: The AHTF award is intended to benefit the communities within the recipient’s primary law enforcement\njurisdiction. Therefore, the recipient must use the AHTF award funding to benefit its own service population. What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the AHTF award cannot provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies\nunless they will directly benefit the recipient’s jurisdiction. For example, a sheriff’s department cannot use an\nAHTF-funded officer to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but can use the\nAHTF-funded officer to provide direct law enforcement services to towns within its own county. 27. Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using AHTF funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with operating\nprinciples of 28 C.F.R. Part 23."
