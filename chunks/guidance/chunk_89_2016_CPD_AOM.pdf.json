The\nguidance provides recommendations to recipients seeking funding for interoperable emergency\ncommunications projects, including allowable costs, items to consider when funding emergency\ncommunications projects, awards management best practices for emergency communications awards, and\ninformation on standards that ensure greater interoperability. The guidance is intended to ensure that federally\nfunded investments are compatible and support national goals and objectives for improving interoperability\nnationwide. Recipients (including sub-recipients) that are using CPD funds to support emergency\ncommunications activities should comply with the latest version of SAFECOM Guidance, including provisions on\ntechnical standards that ensure and enhance interoperable communications. The most recent version of\nSAFECOM guidance is available at www.safecomprogram.gov/grant/Default.aspx. System for Award Management (SAM). The SAM database is the repository for standard information about\nfederal financial assistance applicants, recipients, and sub-recipients. Organizations that have previously\nsubmitted applications via Grants.gov are already registered with SAM, as it is a requirement for Grants.gov\nregistration. Please note, however, that applicants must update or renew their SAM at least once per year to\nmaintain an active status. Information about registration procedures can be accessed at www.sam.gov. supplanting. For the purposes of your COPS Office Community Policing Development award, supplanting\nmeans replacing state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds that otherwise would have been spent on\naward purposes with federal COPS Office funds. State, local, and tribal governments are prohibited from\nsupplanting throughout the award period. This means that your agency may not use COPS Office funds to pay\nfor any equipment/technology, services, personnel, or other items which, in the absence of the COPS Office\nprogram, would otherwise have been funded with state or local funds or with funds supplied by the BIA. The\nCOPS Office funds must instead be used to supplement, or increase, your budget on award purposes. For\nadditional information on supplanting, please review award condition #4 on page 8 in this manual. 110 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development\n(CPD) Program Award Ownerâ€™s Manual This manual was created to assist COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) program recipients with\nthe administrative and financial matters associated with their award.
