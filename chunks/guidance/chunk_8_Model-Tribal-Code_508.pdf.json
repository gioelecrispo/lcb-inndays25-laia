Contact the SMART\nOffice for assistance in\ndetermining which state\noffenses are required to be\nregistered under SORNA. 1. 18 U.S.C. § 1801 (video voyeurism of a minor),\n2. 18 U.S.C. § 2252 (receipt or possession of child pornography),\n3. 18 U.S.C. § 2252A (receipt or possession of child pornography),\n4. 18 U.S.C. § 2252B (misleading domain names on the internet),\n5. 18 U.S.C. § 2252C (misleading words or digital images on the internet), Model Tribal Sex Offender Registration Code | 2 0 1 7 R E V I S E D V E R S I O N 7 6. 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (coercion and enticement of an adult to engage in\nprostitution),\n7. 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) (travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct),\n8. 18 U.S.C. § 2423(c) (engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places),\n9. 18 U.S.C. § 2423(d) (ancillary offenses where the victim is 18 or older),\n10. 18 U.S.C. § 2424 (failure to file factual statement about an alien individual),\n11. 18 U.S.C. § 2425 (use of interstate facilities to transmit information about a\nminor), or\n12. Any other offense defined as a Tier I offense under 42 U.S.C. § 16911(2), as\nit may be amended. G. Certain Military Offenses. Any military offense specified by the Secretary of\nDefense under section 115(a)(8)(C)(i) of Public Law 105-119 (codified at 10\nU.S.C. § 951 note), as amended, that is similar to those offenses outlined in\nSection 3.01(B), (D), (E), or (F) shall be considered a Tier I offense. t SORNA does not require\nan enhanced tiering status\nunless the person has\npreviously been convicted\nof a sex offense that was\npunishable by more than\n1 year in jail. However, as\nmost tribal sex offenses\nhave (until TLOA) been\nlimited to no more than 1\nyear in jail, the technical\nrequirements of SORNA\ncould frustrate the intent\nof the provision. Tribes are\nencouraged to consider\nthis model language in\norder to ensure that repeat\noffenders are classified in\na higher tier than if they\nwere being convicted\nof a first offense. SECTION 3.02 TIER II OFFENSES\nA. Recidivism. Unless otherwise covered by Section 3.03, if an offender has\npreviously been convicted of a sex offense, and the current conviction is for\na sex offense, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a sex offense, the\ncurrent conviction is considered a Tier II offense.
