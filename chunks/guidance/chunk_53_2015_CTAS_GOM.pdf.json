Your agency should continue to use the same DUNS number provided in your grant application and\nupdate, as needed, the information associated with that DUNS number. If your agency is authorized to make\nsubawards under its award, your agency may make subawards only to entities that have DUNS numbers. For\nmore information about your DUNS number, please contact D&B using the toll-free number 866-705-5711 or\nvisit http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. Your agency must maintain active registration and current information in the SAM until you submit the final\nfinancial report or receive the final payment under your award, whichever is later. Your agency must review\nand update its SAM information at least once per year to maintain an active registration status. For more\ninformation about SAM registration, please visit www.sam.gov.\n19.
