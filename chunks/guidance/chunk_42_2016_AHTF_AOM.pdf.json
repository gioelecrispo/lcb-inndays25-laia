Questions and comments regarding SAA audits may\nbe directed to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the OIG for award audits? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits\nare designed to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believed warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on\nan annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances,\nhowever, the OIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the\ngeographical distribution of awards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and\nexpired), and type of award (hiring and non-hiring). As such, the fact that a recipient has been selected for an\nOIG audit is not necessarily indicative of a suspected concern or problem area. 41 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual What are the steps in an OIG audit? The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division’s Audit Liaison Section serves as the liaison between recipients and\nthe OIG’s Audit Division, which conducts the audit. The OIG steps in the audit process will determine the\ninteractions between the OIG, the recipient, and the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section:\n• Call for award data. The OIG requests award documentation from the COPS Office. • Entrance conference. The OIG schedules to meet with the recipient to gather documentation and conduct\naudit. • Draft audit report."
