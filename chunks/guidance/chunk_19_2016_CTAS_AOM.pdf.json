This term means a legal instrument to provide support for the performance of any portion of\nthe substantive project or program for which you received this award and that you as the\nrecipient award to an eligible subrecipient. The term does not include your procurement of property and services needed to carry out the\nproject or program (for further explanation, see Sec. ___.210 of the attachment to OMB Circular\nA-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations”). A subaward may be provided through any legal agreement, including an agreement that you\nconsider a contract. Subrecipient means an entity that:\na.\nb. Receives a subaward from you under this award; and\nIs accountable to you for the use of the federal funds provided by the subaward. Why this condition: The purpose of this standard award term is to ensure government-wide uniformity in establishing the DUNS\nnumber as the universal identifier for federal financial assistance applicants, as well as recipients and their direct\nsubrecipients (if applicable) and to establish the SAM as the repository for standard information about\napplicants and recipients. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was required to provide its DUNS number and be registered in the\nSAM database. Your agency should continue to use the same DUNS number provided in your award application and update, as\nneeded, the information associated with that DUNS number. If your agency is authorized to make subawards\nunder its award, your agency may make subawards only to entities that have DUNS numbers. For more\ninformation about your DUNS number, please contact D&B using the toll-free number 866-705-5711 or visit\nfedgov.dnb.com/webform. Your agency must maintain active registration and current information in the SAM until you submit the final\nfinancial report or receive the final payment under your award, whichever is later. Your agency must review\nand update its SAM information at least once per year to maintain an active registration status. For more\ninformation about SAM registration, please visit www.sam.gov. 17 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual 16.
