  "chunk_text": "A hold may be placed on your award if it is deemed that\nyour agency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an ongoing federal civil\nrights investigation. If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate or draw down federal\nfunds under your agency’s COPS Office award until you comply with federal civil rights laws or cooperate with\nany ongoing federal civil rights investigation. What you should do:\nIncluded with your award package is a memorandum from the Office for Civil Rights, Office of Justice Programs,\nU.S. Department of Justice, which addresses the federal civil rights statutes and regulations applicable to your\naward. You should review this memorandum to understand your agency’s civil rights responsibilities. 44 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the\napplicable federal civil rights laws and to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective enforcement\nof such laws and to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes providing access to\nrecords, accounts, documents, information, facilities, and staff. 11. Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP)\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the development\nand implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that established the COPS Office, that\n“the full and equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal\njustice system is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act’s program to reduce crime and delinquency in\nthe United States” 28 CFR § 42.301. The Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) does not impose quotas or\nhiring requirements on recipients of federal funds. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization’s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private business and has received a single award for $500,000 or\nmore and has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but excluding political\nappointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report and submit it to the OCR for review within 90 days from\nthe start date of the award. For assistance in developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nhttp://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click Complying with the EEOP Requirement. If your organization is a government agency or private business and the largest single award it has received is\n$25,000 or more but less than $500,000, and it has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time\nemployees but excluding political appointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report, but it need not submit\nthe report to the OCR for review."
