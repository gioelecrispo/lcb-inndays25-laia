The OIG requests award documentation from the COPS Office. Entrance conference. The OIG schedules to meet with the recipient to gather documentation and conduct\naudit. Draft audit report. The OIG reviews documentation and presents initial findings to the recipient and copies\nthe COPS Office. The COPS Office interacts with the recipient to coordinate any repayments, and/or policy or\nprocedure documents to be submitted to the OIG before release of the Final Audit Report. Final audit report. The OIG has completed its direct interaction with the recipient.
