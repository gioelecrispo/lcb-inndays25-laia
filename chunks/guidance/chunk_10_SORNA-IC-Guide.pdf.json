See “Tribal\nAccess Program,” page 15. Other tribal\njurisdictions using digital print-taking\ndevices should, if possible, work with the\nstate registry agency and select a device\nthat interfaces with the state’s system, to\nenable electronic submission of prints to\nNGI through the state system.

The FBI’s CJIS Division operates\nand maintains NCIC/NSOR. Many tribal jurisdictions have agreements\nin place, such as memoranda of\nunderstanding, with various state and\nlocal law enforcement agencies in order to\naccess and submit offender information\ninto NCIC/NSOR. Some tribal jurisdictions\nhave their own access and can submit\ndirectly. Be aware that having read-only\naccess to NCIC/NSOR is insufficient: A\ntribal jurisdiction must be able to submit\nand update offender information. Tribal Access Program\nThe U.S. Department of Justice\nlaunched the Tribal Access\nProgram (TAP) to provide tribal\njurisdictions with direct access to\nfederal databases, including NCIC/\nNSOR. The SMART Office is a key\npartner and funder of TAP. For\nmore information on TAP, contact\nTribalAccess@usdoj.gov. TTSORS-NSOR Interconnection\nTribal jurisdictions using TTSORS\nand participating in TAP have\naccess to the TTSORS-NSOR\nInterconnection, an enhanced\nfeature in TTSORS that enables\nregistration information entered\ninto an offender’s TTSORS record\nto be electronically submitted\ninto NCIC/NSOR. This feature\nreduces dual entry and assists in\nensuring timeliness, accuracy and\ncompleteness of an offender’s NSOR\nrecord. For more information, contact\nIIR at registrysupport@nsopw.gov. If the SORNA Officer is uncertain of\nwhether the tribe has full access to NCIC/\nNSOR, contact the tribe’s designated\nlaw enforcement agency. Even if there\nis an agreement in place with another\nentity to provide NCIC access, review the\nagreement to be certain that it includes\nsubmitting registered sex offender\ninformation into NSOR. An agreement for\nNCIC access may have been executed\nprior to a tribe implementing a SORNA program and therefore may not cover submitting\nregistration information. If this is the case, consider working with the tribe’s legal\ncounsel to amend the agreement. For tribes participating in TAP, TTSORS users can\ndirectly submit sex offender information into NSOR TTSORS NSOR Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country | 15 DNA Collection and Submission\nSORNA requires DNA samples to be taken\nfrom sex offenders during the registration\nprocess for analysis and entry into the\nFBI’s CODIS database — if DNA has not\nbeen taken and submitted previously. Some\nstates work with SORNA tribal jurisdictions\nto take, preserve and submit DNA samples\nfrom sex offenders for entry into CODIS and\nto complete the requisite follow-through\nneeded on a match between an offender and\na forensic profile (known as a “cold hit”). Where such cooperation and coordination\nexists, SORNA tribal jurisdictions should\ninclude memoranda of understanding or\ncooperative agreements regarding DNA\nsubmissions as part of their substantial\nimplementation submission to the\nSMART Office. See “Establishing a SORNA\nProgram,” page 22. Tribes are encouraged\nto work with states to establish procedures\nfor this SORNA DNA requirement."
