The US Department of Homeland Security Office of Emergency Communications, in\ncoordination with various stakeholder groups, develops the annual SAFECOM Guidance on Emergency\nCommunications Grants. The guidance provides recommendations to recipients seeking funding for interoperable\nemergency communications projects, including allowable costs, items to consider when funding emergency\ncommunications projects, awards management best practices for emergency communications awards, and\ninformation on standards that ensure greater interoperability. The guidance is intended to ensure that federally\nfunded investments are compatible and support national goals and objectives for improving interoperability\nnationwide. Recipients (including sub-recipients) that are using CPD funds to support emergency communications\nactivities should comply with the latest version of SAFECOM Guidance, including provisions on technical standards\nthat ensure and enhance interoperable communications. The most recent version of SAFECOM guidance is\navailable at www.safecomprogram.gov/grant/Default.aspx. System for Award Management (SAM). The SAM database is the repository for standard information about\nfederal financial assistance applicants, recipients, and sub-recipients. Organizations that have previously submitted\napplications via Grants.gov are already registered with SAM, as it is a requirement for Grants.gov registration. Please note, however, that applicants must update or renew their SAM at least once per year to maintain an active\nstatus. Information about registration procedures can be accessed at www.sam.gov. supplanting. For the purposes of your COPS Office CPD award, supplanting means replacing state, local, or Bureau\nof Indian Affairs (BIA) funds that otherwise would have been spent on award purposes with federal COPS Office\nfunds. State, local, and tribal governments are prohibited from supplanting throughout the award period. This\nmeans that your agency may not use COPS Office funds to pay for any equipment/technology, services, personnel,\nor other items which, in the absence of the COPS Office program, would otherwise have been funded with state or\nlocal funds or with funds supplied by the BIA. The COPS Office funds must instead be used to supplement, or\nincrease, your budget on award purposes. For additional information on supplanting, please review the award\ncondition titled ‘Supplementing, Not Supplanting’ in this manual. 125 2017 COPS Office Community Policing Development\nProgram (CPD) Award Owner’s Manual This manual was created to assist COPS Office Community Policing Development program (CPD) recipients with the\nadministrative and financial matters associated with their award.
