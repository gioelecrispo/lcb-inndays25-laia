The use of this online application enables authorized users to view past SF-425s and allows\nthem to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports (SF-425) due? SF-425s for COPS Office awards must be submitted every quarter and no later than 30 days after the last day of\neach reporting quarter, as detailed in table 1:\nTable 1. Due dates of SF-425 by quarter\nReporting quarter\nJanuary 1–March 31\nApril 1–June 30\nJuly 1–September 30\nOctober 1–December 31 SF-425 due date\nApril 30\nJuly 30\nOctober 30\nJanuary 30 45 2016 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner’s Manual For your initial SF-425 submission, determine when the most recent SF-425 reporting quarter ended and\ncomplete an SF-425 to cover the period from the award start date to the end of that period. You are required to\nsubmit an SF-425 even if you have not spent any money or incurred any costs during a reporting period. The due dates for online filing of SF-425s are the same as for the submission of paper copies. Example: If your award start date is 02-01-13 and the current date is 04-15-13, then your first SF-425 would be due no later\nthan 04-30-13 and would cover the period 02-01-13 (award start date) through 03-31-13 (end of the most recent\nreporting period). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office so that you can successfully complete a\ndrawdown of funds through GPRS. Award recipients who do not submit SF-425s by the due date each quarter will be unable to draw down award\nfunds until the report has been successfully submitted. The payment system contains a function which checks\nfor SF-425 delinquency and will reject a drawdown attempt if the SF-425 is not up to date. Subsequent outreach\nthrough e-mail, fax, or hard copy reminders may be sent to the recipient if the SF-425 is delinquent. For general information concerning online filing of SF-425 reports, go to www.cops.usdoj.gov or contact the\nCOPS Office Response Center by phone at 800-421-6770 or by e-mail at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov. For assistance in completing the SF-425, contact the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 or by e-mail\nat AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov or review the “Helpful Hints Guide for Completing the Federal Financial Report (SF425)” at www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/SF-425_Helpful_Hints_Guide_5.9.13.pdf. How will awards be monitored? The COPS Office and designated representatives from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of Justice\nPrograms monitor the financial aspects of your agency’s award through financial reports, on-site visits, officebased grant reviews, meetings, telephone contacts, reports, audits, reviews of grant change requests, and\nspecial request submissions. Program Progress Reports\nQuarterly Program Progress Reports and a Final Program Progress (Closeout) Report are required to be\nsubmitted directly to the COPS Office through the “Account Access” link of the COPS Office website at\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov.
