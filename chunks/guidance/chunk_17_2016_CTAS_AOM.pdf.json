Why this condition: This condition advises recipients of the consequences of submitting false claims or statements on applications,\nfinancial and programmatic reports, or other award documents.

Duplicative Funding\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees to notify the COPS Office if it receives, from any other source, funding for the\nsame item or service also funded under this award. Why this condition: This award was provided to your agency to address its law enforcement needs that are not funded from other\nsources, including federal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds. Consequently, your agency may not use this funding\nfor items or services for which you already have funding from other sources. What you should do: If your agency receives funding from another source for the same item(s) or services(s) also funded under this\naward, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770.

Why this condition: In accordance with 2 CFR § 200.207, the DOJ may impose additional requirements specific to your award, as\nneeded, when it determines that there is unsatisfactory performance, financial or administrative instability,\nnoncompliance with award terms and conditions, or other lack of responsibility risk factors.
