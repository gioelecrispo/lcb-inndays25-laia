Participant Support Costs: Participant support costs are generally excluded from the\ndistribution base. Therefore, indirect costs may not be applied against participant support\ncosts. Participant support costs are direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence\nallowances, travel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or\ntrainees (but not employees) in connection with meetings, conferences, symposia, or training\nprojects. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.75. This exclusion applies to the entirety of any subcontracts for the\nlodging and travel of conference participants or trainees (but not employees). Costs related to\ncontractors of the recipient who are acting in the capacity of a “Conference Trainer/Instructor/\nPresenter/Facilitator” are considered participant support costs. For more information on allowable costs for conferences and training, please see the 2016 DOJ\nFinancial Guide available at www.ojp.gov/financialguide/DOJ/index.htm. Indirect costs were removed from the budget if the recipient did not provide, at the time of\napplication, either a current approved federal indirect cost rate or documentation showing a\npending request for approval by the cognizant federal agency. If the recipient has never received a\nfederally approved indirect cost rate, it may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of modified\ntotal direct costs (MTDC) in lieu of negotiating a rate with the cognizant federal agency. See 2 CFR §\n200.414(f).\n28. Follow the COPS Office Curriculum Standards, Review and Approval Guide and COPS Office\nInstructor Quality Assurance Guide, if developing training curriculum or delivering training under\nthis cooperative agreement. A copy of these guides will be supplied to you by the program\nmanager. 42 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual 29. Notify and consult with the COPS Office prior to establishing a formal partnership with any nonfederal entity, including soliciting and accepting free goods or services, on activities under this\ncooperative agreement.

If any part of the funded project contains research or statistical activities which involve human\nsubjects that are not covered by an exemption set forth in 28 C.F.R. § 46.101(b), the recipient must\nmeet the provisions of the U.S. Department of Justice’s common rule regarding the Protection of\nHuman Subjects, 28 C.F.R. Part 46, prior to the expenditure of federal funds to perform such\nactivities. The recipient also agrees to comply with 28 C.F.R.

Implementation of this award will be subject to federal monitoring, auditing, or evaluation, and/or\na single audit in accordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.501.
