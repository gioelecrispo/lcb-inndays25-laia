Community policing\nCommunity policing activities to be initiated or enhanced by your agency were identified and described in your\ngrant application. All equipment, technology, training, and/or sworn officer positions awarded under the TRGP\ngrant must be linked to the implementation or enhancement of community policing. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office defines community policing as a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that\nsupport the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the\nimmediate conditions giving rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. TRGP grants must be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities. All newly hired, additional, or\nrehired officers (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) funded under TRGP-Hiring must engage\nin community policing activities. While the COPS Office recognizes that your COPS Office-funded officer(s)\n(or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) will participate in some or all aspects of your identified\ncommunity policing plan and advance your agency’s community policing activities over the life of the grant,\nwe also encourage your agency to move toward an organization-wide philosophy and commitment to\ncommunity policing. COPS Office grants are designed to increase community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This is achieved through problem-solving tactics and community policing partnerships. It enhances police\nprofessionalism by providing officers with the skills and motivation to act in innovative ways to solve\ncommunity crime-related problems. Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure that it is\ninitiating or enhancing community policing in accordance with your proposed plan, and that the officers\nhired (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance\nyour agency’s community policing activities over the life of the grant."
