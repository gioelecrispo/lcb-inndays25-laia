COMPUTING THE CORRECTIONAL COMPLEMENT. A total of 364 days\nis used as a base year for a 7-day post. A 5-day post is 260\ndays. These figures are determined by multiplying the number of\ndays per week a post is manned, i.e., 7-day post, 5-day post, 3day post, and etc., by the amount of weeks in a year (52). After\ndetermining the total number of each post in an institution (7day post, 5-day post, and etc.), each total is multiplied by the\nappropriate base year figures (see examples below). In order to allow for training and annual/sick leave, a position\nis calculated at 210 days per year. The subtotal (man days) is\ndivided by 210. The result is the number of positions required\nto staff the Correctional Services Department. Example:\n` 50 (total number of 7 Day Posts) x 364 = 18,200\n20 (total number of 5 Day Posts) x 260 = 5,200 10 (total number of 3 Day Posts) x 156 = 1,560\nSubtotal: 24,960 (total man days)\n24,960 divided 210 = 118 positions plus 180 man days, which\nequals 119 positions. A remainder of 72 or more is one\nadditional position. To determine the authorized correctional complement for a\nparticular Bureau institution, the following definitions and\ncalculations should be clearly understood:\n1. Post. A post is the location or assignment that is\nactually worked by a staff member. 2. Position."
