Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must\nbe infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think\ninnovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A\nmajor conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way\nis the SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the\nscope of severity, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the selected problem is\ntypically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents similar in one or more\nways, and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a place, a\nperson or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from the\ncommunity, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Analyzing\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding\nof the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish\ncorrelation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to\nfind out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who? what? when? where? how?\nwhy? and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. 62 2016 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner’s Manual Response: Responding to problems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem. The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem to reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem or improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Assessing problem-solving initiatives\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by determining if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but\nalso gathers data that builds knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process,\noutcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis\nshould be reviewed."
