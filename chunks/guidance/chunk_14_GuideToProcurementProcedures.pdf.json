Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352). Contractors that apply or bid for an\naward exceeding $100,000 must file the required certification. Each tier certifies to the\ntier above that it will not and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any\nperson or organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee\nof any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of Congress, or an employee\nof a member of Congress in connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or\nany other award covered by 31 U.S.C. 1352. Each tier must also disclose any lobbying\nwith non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the non-Federal award. Reference: Part 200 Appendix II(I)\n8. Procurement of recovered materials. A non-Federal entity that is a state agency or\nagency of a political subdivision of a state must include a provision requiring contractors\nto comply with section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act. Per Section 6002, where the purchase price of\nthe item exceeds $10,000 or the value of the quantity acquired during the preceding\nfiscal year exceeded $10,000, these non-Federal entities and their contractors must\nprocure only items, designated in guidelines of the EPA at 40 C.F.R. ยง 247, containing the\nhighest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent with maintaining a\nsatisfactory level of competition. These non-Federal entities and their contractors must\nprocure solid waste management services so that energy and resource recovery are\nmaximized, and they must establish an affirmative procurement program for\nprocurement of recovered materials identified in the EPA guidelines. Reference: Part 200 Appendix II(J), 2 C.F.R. ยง 200.322. Page | 27 Chapter 12\nContract Type Selection The following is a list of various contract types. Contract Type can refer both to\nthe overall structure of a contract (e.g. task or delivery order) and the pricing\nstructure of a contract (fixed price vs. cost reimbursement). Determining which\ncontract type to use is important to ensure cost-effectiveness and performance. Pricing Structure: The non-Federal entity must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with\nevery procurement action (including modifications) in excess of the Simplified\nAcquisition Threshold. The exact method and degree of analysis will vary\ndepending on the exact circumstances and facts of a particular procurement\nsituation, but the non-Federal entity must, as a starting point, make independent\nestimates before receiving bids or proposals. 11\n1. Fixed Price. All contracts awarded under a competitive sealed bidding result in some\ntype of \"fixed price\" arrangement, normally a firm fixed price. Fixed price contracts may\nalso be awarded under other contracting methods such as negotiation/competitive\nproposals, for instance, where the use of sealed bidding would be inappropriate\nbecause discussions with the contractor are deemed necessary. Fixed price contracts\nhave the advantage that the risk rests with the contractor. Firm fixed price contracts\nmay be appropriate when:\na. It is possible to describe exactly what is needed to satisfy the requirement;\nb."
