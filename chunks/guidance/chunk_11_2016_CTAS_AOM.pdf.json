Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the TRGP Hiring award. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may\nbe carried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may be improved, and\n9 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which\nyour agency implements its TRGP award. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or evaluators may study the\neffectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the\nprograms’ effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask\nquestions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel about\ncommunity policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other communities\nand police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits\nand information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information\nabout your award activities. You should fully comply with any requests regarding these evaluations. 8.

The progress report is used to track your\nagency’s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness\nof increasing your agency’s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding."
