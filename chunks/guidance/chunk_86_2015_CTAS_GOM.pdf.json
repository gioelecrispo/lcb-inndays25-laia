  "chunk_text": "Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just in special units, although\nthere may be a need for some specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly\ncomplex problems or managing complex partnerships. Resources and finances Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources to support\ncommunity policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained\nand effective. 75 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Personnel The principles of community policing need to be diffused throughout the entire personnel system of an\nagency including recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from\nsworn officers to civilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be\naligned with the agencies’ community policing values. Recruitment, hiring, and selection Agencies need a systematic means of incorporating community\npolicing elements into their recruitment, selection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize\ncommunity policing and problem-solving responsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers\nwho have a spirit of service, instead of only a spirit of adventure. A community policing agency must also\nthoughtfully examine where it is seeking recruits, whom it is recruiting and hiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community involvement in this process through the identification of\ncompetencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations Supervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing\nprinciples and activities that are incorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional\nprocedures should support sound problem-solving activities, proactive policing, community collaboration,\nand citizen satisfaction with police services. Training Training at all levels—academy, field, and in-service—must support community policing principles\nand tactics. It also needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and\nanalytical skills, and techniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers\ncan be trained to identify and correct conditions that could lead to crime, to raise public awareness, and\nto engage the community in finding solutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to\nlearn how to encourage problem solving and help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until\ncommunity policing is institutionalized in the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to\ntake place regularly. Information systems (technology) Community policing is information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in helping to provide ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with improving two-way communication with citizens and in\ndeveloping agency accountability systems and performance outcome measures. Communication/access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to\ncommunicate externally with the public and internally with their own staff. To communicate with the\npublic, community policing encourages agencies to develop two-way communication systems through\nthe Internet that allow for online reports, reverse 911 and e-mail alerts, discussion forums, and feedback on\ninteractive applications (surveys, maps), thereby creating ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters,\ne-mail and enhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with\nother entities for more efficient operations."
