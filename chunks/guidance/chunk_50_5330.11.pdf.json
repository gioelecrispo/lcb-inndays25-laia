An inmate may withdraw voluntarily from the program. Withdrawals must be documented in PDS and a memorandum forwarded to the Unit Team. An inmate may also be moved to Incomplete status for many reasons: placement in the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU), removed from the institution on a writ, unforseen redesignation, etc. An\nincomplete does not mean the inmate is automatically a failure. The Treatment Coordinator and\nP5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 4\nPage 5 the treatment team will make the decision on the inmate’s final treatment determination,\ndepending on the reason for his or her incomplete status. The Treatment Coordinator will ensure\nproper documentation of the meeting in PDS and SENTRY. 4.8.3. Expulsion. Inmates may be removed from the program by the coordinator because of\ndisruptive behavior related to the program or unsatisfactory progress in treatment. Ordinarily,\nstaff will provide the inmate with at least one treatment intervention prior to removal. In response\nto disruptive behavior or unsatisfactory progress, treatment staff will:\n• Meet with the inmate to discuss his or her behavior or lack of progress. • Assign the treatment intervention(s) chosen to reduce or eliminate the behavior, or to improve\nprogress. • Warn the inmate of the consequences of failure to alter his/her behavior. • Properly document in PDS the meeting and treatment intervention(s) assigned. • Properly document in PDS changes to the inmate's treatment plan, and ensure that both staff\nand the inmate sign the amended treatment plan. • When appropriate, require the inmate to discuss his or her targeted behavior in the community. In the event repeated treatment interventions are required in response to inappropriate behaviors\nor unsatisfactory progress, the treatment team will meet to decide if the inmate will be removed\nfrom the program. Within two working days after a decision has been made to expel an inmate, the Program\nCoordinator will:\n• Verbally notify the inmate of his/her expulsion status. • Update the pertinent SENTRY PTP assignments. • Ensure proper documentation of the expulsion has been entered into PDS.

Violence or threats of violence. Escape or attempted escape. Any 100-level series incident. An inmate may be expelled from the program without a formal intervention if the inmate is\ndetermined to have violated confidentiality. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 4\nPage 6 In limited circumstances, an inmate may be expelled from the program without a formal\nintervention if the inmate’s behavior is of such magnitude that an inmate’s continued presence in\nprogramming would create an immediate and ongoing problem for staff and/or other inmates. Whenever immediate expulsion is necessary the program coordinator, or designee, will:\n• Inform the inmate of his or her expulsion. • Ensure proper documentation of the meeting and expulsion are entered into PDS."
