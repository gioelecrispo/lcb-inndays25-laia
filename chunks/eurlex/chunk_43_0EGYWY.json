They give indicative information on what a KIC in the specific area could do, but do not prescribe future KICs' activities and working methods. (4) Spending on health differs from country to country. Share in GDP ranges from 1,1 to 9,7 % and from 4 % to over 18 % of total public spending. Health related sectors have a high R&D intensity: pharmaceuticals and biotechnology outnumber by far any other sector (15,9 %); health care equipment and services are also very high (6,8 %). (5) For example in terms of patient's access to high quality medicines, which is delayed because of legislation for approving new drug products on the market with more time dedicated to tests and certification and for setting prices and reimbursement modalities. (6) In this factsheet, the narrower definition of \"non energy, non agricultural raw materials\" will be used in order to reduce potential overlap with existing Climate Change and Energy KICs, as well as with other future KIC priority areas such as food.

Around 85 % of the Union's GDP is generated in urban areas. Urbanisation is expected to rise in Europe to some 83 % by 2050.
