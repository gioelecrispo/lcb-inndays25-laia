(5) Thresholds associated with nine planetary boundaries have been identified which, once crossed, could lead to irreversible changes with potentially disastrous consequences for humans, including: climate change, biodiversity loss, global freshwater use, ocean acidification, the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and land-use change (Ecology and Society, Vol. 14, No 2, 2009). (6) According to the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, without action, the overall costs of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5 % of global gross domestic product (GDP) each year. Including a wider range of risks and impacts, this figure could increase this to 20 % of GDP. (7) OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050: The Consequences of Inaction (report, 2012). (8) COM(2011) 244.
