  "chunk_text": "The False Claims Act o f 1863, 12 Stat. 696, authorized any person\nto prosecute, in the name o f the United States, a civil action against a con­\ntractor for alleged fraud against the United States. As a reward, the rela­\ntor received a share o f any recovery. After the Civil War, this qui tam\nstatute fell into relative desuetude. By 1986, except for a flurry o f activi­\nty during World War II, it had become an anachronism. In 1986, Congress, dissatisfied with the way the executive branch was\nenforcing government procurement laws, sought to breathe new life into\nthis dormant device. To stimulate private enforcement suits, Congress\namended the False Claims Act to provide for treble damages and penal­\nties o f up to $10,000 for each false claim, and to provide for a bounty to\nthe relator o f up to thirty percent o f any recovery (the “ 1986 Amend­\nments”). The congressional proponents o f these amendments made no\npretense about the fact that they distrusted the executive’s willingness or\nability to enforce the law properly, and they stated that their purpose was\nto “deputize” private citizens to ensure effective law enforcement. In the two years since enactment o f the 1986 Amendments, there has\nbeen a massive upsurge in qui tam actions — over 150 suits have been\nfiled. These actions have disrupted the civil and criminal enforcement\nactivities o f the Department. See Memorandum for the Solicitor General,\nfrom Stuart E. Schiffer, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division\n(June 15, 1989). They have also undermined the executive’s ability to\nadminister complex procurement contracts and, in some cases, have\ncaused serious national security concerns. The 1986 Amendments have\nalso spawned the formation o f full-time “bounty hunting” groups —\nersatz departments o f justice — that go about prosecuting civil fraud\nactions in the name o f the United States. C. Qui Tam’s Unconstitutionality The Office o f Legal Counsel believes that the qui tam provisions o f the\nFalse Claims Act are patently unconstitutional. In our view, this is not\neven a close question. Our conclusion rests on three grounds. First, we believe that private qui tam actions violate the Appointments\nClause o f the Constitution. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. The Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly held that conducting litigation on behalf o f the United States\nto enforce the rights o f the United States must be carried out by an exec­\nutive branch official or other properly appointed government officer. The\nConstitution thus does not permit Congress to vest governmental law\n209 enforcement authority in self-selected private parties, who have not been\nit\\jured and who act from mercenary motives, without commitment to the\nUnited States’ interests and without accountability. Second, we believe qui tam suits violate Article III standing doctrine. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that under Article III, a plaintiff\nis ineligible to invoke federal judicial power unless he can demonstrate\nthat he has suffered “ir\\jury in fact” as a result o f the defendant’s alleged­\nly illegal conduct. Qui tam relators suffer no ii\\jury in fact and thus fail to\nmeet this bedrock constitutional requirement."
