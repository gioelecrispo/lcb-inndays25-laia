No.\n87-286 for maintenance of the White House and its grounds. 2 This Office\nadvised the White House in 1974 that 16 U.S.C. § 6a authorized the Secretary\nof the Interior to accept the donation of a swimming pool at the White House\nfor the President’s use. The mentioned statutes are silent on the question of the acceptance of\nconditional gifts. As a general rule, such gifts may not be accepted by the\nGovernment without the express approval of Congress. Story v. Snyder, 184 F.\n(2d) 454, 456 (D.C. Cir. 1950). The policy of the Curator of the White House\nhas been to refuse gifts offered on the condition that they be displayed in a\ncertain manner or location in the White House, on the ground that this would\ninterfere with the continuing responsibility of the Committee for the Preserva­\ntion of the White House to maintain the interior of the White House in the\nmanner deemed suitable at a particular time. Executive Order No. 11145, 3\nCFR 184 (1964-1965 compilation), reprinted in 3 U.S.C. § 110 note (1976). The type of condition that would be acceptable to the Curator would be, for\nexample, attaching a small plaque to the gift to identify the donor. The current\nWhite House policy appears to be consistent with the general rule on\nconditional gifts outlined above. We recommend that a similar policy on\nacceptance of conditional gifts be adopted for the Vice President’s residence. It is our understanding that, by arrangement with the National Park Service,\nmaintenance and furnishing of the East and West Wings of the White House are\nthe responsibility of the General Services Administration (GSA). According to\n'Section 1 of Pub. L. No. 87-286, 75 Stat. 586 (1961), describes the “ While H ouse\" as “ all of\nthat portion of reservation numbered 1 in the city of W ashington, District of Columbia, which is\nwithin the President’s park enclosure, comprising eighteen and seven one-hundredths acres . . . ”\n2The Department of the Interior’s responsibility derives from the language in § I o f Pub. L. No.\n87-286 that the White House and its grounds “ shall be administered pursuant to the Act of August\n25, 1916, 39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-3, and Acts supplementary thereto and amendatory thereof.” The Act of August 25, 1916, established the National Park Service in the Department of the\nInterior. 350 the Curator’s Office, few of the furnishings donated to the White House are\nused in the East and West Wings; when they are, the items are apparently\nregarded as being on loan from the.collection intended for the residence. We\nsee no reason why gifts donated to the White House, especially those of an\nhistorical nature, cannot be used in the East and West Wings in this fashion. The General Services Administration has jurisdiction over the Old Executive\nOffice Building and would therefore be the proper recipient of any gifts for use\nin that building. The Administrator of GSA is authorized to accept on behalf of\nthe United States “ unconditional gifts of real, personal, or other property in aid\nof any project or function” within his jurisdiction. 40 U.S.C. § 298a (1976)."
