As we explain more fully below, we believe\nthat section 235A requires the Attorney General to establish and maintain certain\npreinspection stations provided the foreign countries concerned have consented\nto the establishment of such stations on their territory and provided that certain\nother preconditions have been satisfied. Section 235A does not, however, oblige\nthe Attorney General or any other executive branch official to enter into diplo­\nmatic negotiations with foreign countries in order to obtain that consent, and it\ndoes not require that preinspection stations be established before the preconditions\nhave been satisfied. BACKGROUND\nSection 235A was added to the INA by section 123 of the Illegal Immigration\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104—208, 110\nStat. 3009—546, 3009-560 ( “ IIRIRA” ). It mandates the establishment of immigra­\ntion “ preinspection” stations at certain foreign airports. 1 Prior to the passage of\nsection 235A, the INA authorized, but did not require, the establishment of\npreinspection stations, and the relevant statutory provisions were neither modified\n1 “ Preinspection” generally refers to immigration inspection procedures conducted at foreign ports of embarkation\nby United States authorities for passengers seeking entry into the United States In some instances, immigration\npreinspection is accompanied by U S. Customs clearance as well."

Sites containing both immigration and customs\ninspection are generally called “ preclearance” sites See, e.g., Agreement Between the Government of the United\nStates o f America and the G overnment of Canada on Air Transport Preclearance, May 8, 1974, art 1(a), 25 U S T\n763 ( “ U S.-Canada A greem ent” ). Section 235A refers only to preinspection. 276 Section 235A o f the Immigration and Nationality Act nor repealed by passage of section 235A. Specifically, under INA § 103(a)(7),\n8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(7), the Attorney General “ may, with the concurrence of the\nSecretary of State, establish offices of the [INS] in foreign countries.” Pursuant\nto that authority, the INS established and maintains preinspection stations at air­\nports in Canada, Ireland, Bermuda, and several other ports of embarkation in the\nCaribbean. Establishing those stations involved entering into diplomatic negotia­\ntions with the foreign countries involved. See, e.g., U.S.-Canada Agreement, 25\nU.S.T. at 763. In contrast, section 235A requires (and does not merely authorize) the establish­\nment of preinspection stations.

These requirements stand as conditions precedent to the statutory duty to establish\nany o f the preinspection stations called for by sections 235A(a)(l) and (4): the\nAttorney General must ensure that they are met “ [p]rior to the establishment of\na preinspection station,” INA §235A(a)(5), and the statutory requirement that\npreinspection stations be established by defined dates is “ [sjubject to” these pre­\nconditions.

In a letter dated January 20, 1998, the Assistant Sec­\nretary of State for Consular Affairs reported that “ only one [country] (Jamaica)\ngave preliminary indication that it would support establishment of an INS\npreinspection station.” Letter for Hon. Doris Meissner, Commissioner, INS, from\nMary A. Ryan, Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, Dept, of State at 2 (Jan.\n20, 1998) (“ Ryan Letter” ).5 To date, no preinspection stations have been estab­\nlished pursuant to section 235A. DISCUSSION To determine whether section 235A unconstitutionally intrudes on the Presi­\ndent’s authority to conduct foreign relations, we begin by identifying section\n235A’s precise requirements. For present purposes, this involves interpreting sec­\ntions 235A(a)(l), (4), and (5). The first two provisions stipulate how many\npreinspection stations are to be established and maintained, the criteria those sta­\ntions must meet, and the dates by which they are to be established. The third\nspecifies certain conditions that must be met before a preinspection station is\nestablished. Sections 235A(a)(l) and (4) both direct the Attorney General, in consultation\nwith the Secretary of State, to “ establish” (and, in the case of section 235A(a)(l),\n“ maintain” ) preinspection stations meeting certain criteria. Section 235A(a)(l)\nprovides that, by Octobcr 31, 1998, the Attorney General “ shall establish and\nmaintain preinspection stations in at least 5 of the foreign airports that are among\nthe 10 foreign airports which the Attorney General identifies as serving as last\npoints of departure for the greatest numbers of inadmissible alien passengers who\narrive from abroad by air at ports of entry within the United States.” Id. Section\n235A(a)(4) provides that, by October 31, 2000, she “ shall establish preinspection\nstations in at least 5 additional foreign airports which the Attorney General, in\nconsultation with the Secretary of State, determines, based on the data compiled\nunder paragraph (3) and such other information as may be available, would most\neffectively reduce the number of aliens who arrive from abroad by air at points\nof entry within the United States who are inadmissible to the United States.” Id. Sections 235A(a)(l) and (4) thus appear to contemplate a two-step process. First, the Attorney General is to identify potential sites for preinspection stations\nthat meet the criteria set out in the relevant section. Second, she is to establish\nsuch stations at a minimum number of sites by the dates prescribed. 5 The Ryan Letter noted that “ [o]ne country (Dominican Republic) indicated it might be willing to allow a\npreinspection staiion, but only if full preclearance was allowed, i.e customs inspections as w ell.” Ryan Letter at\n2 The Ryan Letter further explained that fourteen countries were “ queried ” Id at 2."

As to the fifteenth country,\nGuatemala, the Ryan Letter explained that “ [o]ur embassy in Guatemala has not yet been able to obtain an initial\nreaction from authorities in that country.’* Id. 279 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 24 Additionally, however, sections 235A(a)(l) and (4) both provide that their\nrequirements are “ [s]ubject to” section 235A(a)(5), which, in turn, sets out certain\nconditions that must be met before a preinspection station is established. See supra\np. 279 (quoting section 235A(a)(5)). The ordinary meaning of “ subject to”\nincludes “ governed or affected b y .” Black’s Law Dictionary 1425 (6th ed. 1990). Thus, sections 235A(a)(l) and (4), including the deadlines they prescribe, are\n“ governed or affected by” the conditions set out in section 235A(a)(5).6 Once\nthe Attorney General identifies a potential site for a preinspection station, the\nrequirement that it be “ established” by a particular date does not take effect until\nthe Attorney General is able to ensure that the site meets section 235A(a)(5)’s\nconditions. Section 235A does not specify precisely how the Attorney General is to ensure\nthat the sites she selects for preinspection stations meet section 235A(a)(5)’s\nconditions or how she is to go about establishing and maintaining such stations\nonce they meet those conditions. Because the preinspection stations are to be\nlocated in foreign countries, establishing those stations is not entirely within the\ncontrol of the Attorney General or, indeed, the executive branch as a whole. Rather, preinspection stations can only be established after the United States\nobtains the consent of the foreign countries concerned. See, e.g., U.S.-Canada\nAgreement, supra.1 For two reasons, we do not read section 235A as requiring the executive branch\nto seek or obtain such consent. First, such a reading would impose on the execu­\ntive branch the obligation to achieve outcomes beyond its control. While the\nExecutive may negotiate with foreign sovereigns in an effort to obtain their con­\nsent to the establishment of preinspection stations within their territory, it is not\nwithin the Executive’s power to ensure that such consent is actually given. Simi­\nlarly, the Attorney General’s ability to ensure that section 235A(a)(5)’s conditions\nare met depends at least in part on the cooperation of the relevant foreign govern­\nment, cooperation that she cannot guarantee. Providing “ appropriate protection”\nto federal employees working at preinspection stations, protecting those employees\nand their families from “ unreasonable risks to their welfare and safety,” and\nensuring that aliens in a foreign country receive appropriate “ protection from\nreturn to persecution’ ’ are all undertakings that require the cooperation and partici­\npation of the foreign sovereign concerned. Id. Without that cooperation and\nparticipation, it is not possible for the Attorney General herself either to ensure\n6 C f American Rivers v.

We presume that section 235A is not intended to demand the impossible of\nthe Attorney General. See M cNeil v. Time Ins. Co., 205 F.3d 179, 187 (5th Cir.\n2000) (“ It is a flawed and unreasonable construction of any statute to read it\nin a manner that demands the impossible.” ); Ambassadors and other Public M in­\nisters o f the United States, 7 Op. Att’y Gen. 186, 218 (1855) (Cushing, Att’y\nGen.) (“ [I]t is unreasonable to presume in any circumstances . . . that Congress\nintended to enact what is unreasonable.” ). Accordingly, we do not read section\n235A as requiring the executive branch to obtain either foreign countries’ consent\nto the establishment of preinspection stations or their cooperation in ensuring that\nsection 235A(a)(5)’s conditions are met with respect to those stations. Second, we do not read section 235A to require the Executive to enter into\ndiplomatic negotiations to obtain foreign countries’ consent to the establishment\nof preinspection stations, because such a requirement would unconstitutionally\ninfringe on the President’s foreign affairs power. The Constitution commits to\nthe President the responsibility for conducting the nation’s foreign affairs. 8 That\nresponsibility includes the ‘‘ ‘exclusive authority to determine the time, scope, and\nobjectives’ ” of all international negotiations. Issues Raised by Foreign Relations\nAuthorization Bill, 14 Op. O.L.C. 37, 41 (1990) (quoting 2 Pub. Papers of Ronald\nReagan 1541, 1542 (1987) (President Reagan’s statement on signing the Foreign\nRelations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989)). If section 235A were\nconstrued to require the Executive to negotiate with foreign countries in an attempt\nto obtain their consent to the establishment of preinspection stations, it would\nunconstitutionally intrude on that exclusive authority. Such a reading would run\nafoul of the principle that Congress may not require the Executive to “ initiate\ndiscussion with foreign nations” or “ order[] the Executive to negotiate and enter\ninto treaties” or other types of international agreements.
