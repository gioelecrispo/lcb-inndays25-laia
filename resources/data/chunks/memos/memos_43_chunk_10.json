T here is nothing in my obligation to\nmy profession or to the courts that prevents me from discharging my\nduty either to defend the A cts o f C ongress o r to question them in the\nrare cases in w hich that is appropriate. Question 9: W hat specific instances are there in w hich a court o r bar\nassociation has expressly asserted an ethical duty for gov­\nernm ent litigators to inquire into the validity o f A cts of\nCongress? I know o f no decision by a court or a bar association that expressly\nasserts that governm ent litigators have an ethical duty either to inquire\ninto the validity o f A cts o f C ongress or to defend them. Question 10: Has the Justice D epartm ent ever sought from Congress\nlegislation to deal with any asserted ethical problem in\nlitigation concerning the validity o f A cts o f Congress? No. Question 11: Has there been any relevant change in the ethical rules\nin the past few years, since the Justice D epartm ent has\nfirst begun denying the validity o f A cts o f Congress? I know o f no recent change in any ethical rule that relates to this\nproblem . Y our question assumes that the Justice D epartm ent has some\nnew policy in this field. F rom w hat I have said in response to your\n62 questions, and from the historical examples I have given, I hope it is\nclear that we have no new policy. O ur policy is an old one. Sincerely,\nB e n ja m in 63 R. C iv il e t t i"
