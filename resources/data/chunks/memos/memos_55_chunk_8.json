  "chunk_text": "The weakness in this argument is that it simply presupposes its\nconclusion: it assumes that an “investigative or law enforcement offi­\ncer” for purposes of § 2518 could not be, in the context of an intercep­\ntion under §2516(1) directed at narcotics offenses, an officer of the\nFBI. That is, of course, the question to be answered. It cannot be\nresolved simply by stating conclusorily that § 2516(1) could not be read\nto empower the FBI to participate in court-approved interceptions\ndirected at the offenses listed in it. As noted above, under §2516(l)’s\nmost natural reading it in fact does authorize the FBI to participate in\ncourt-approved interceptions directed at any of the offenses listed in it. IV. For all the reasons stated in this opinion, we do not read § 2516(1) to\nrequire the FBI to have general investigative responsibility for an\noffense listed in that subsection before the FBI may be judicially au­\nthorized to participate in an interception directed at such an offense,\nincluding narcotics offenses. Accordingly, in the type of case that gave\nrise to your opinion request to this Office, we conclude that, under\n§2516(1), the FBI may be judicially authorized to participate in a\ncourt-approved interception directed at an offense noted in that provi­\nsion.
