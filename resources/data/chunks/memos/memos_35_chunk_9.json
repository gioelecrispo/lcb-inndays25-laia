  "chunk_text": "In view of the doubt that may have been created by the portion of the Florida\nAttorney General’s opinion we have discussed, it would be helpful if reconsideration of that portion of the opinion could be had. While the problem, as it affects arrests for federal offenses, is one of interpretation and application of state law, it has nevertheless been made so by the action of\nCongress and the judicial extension of section 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (18\nU.S.C. § 3041). The correct application of the appropriate state law in the federal\ncases is therefore not only a matter of federal interest but may involve, in the legal\nsense, a federal question, cf. Dice v. Akron, Canton and Youngstown R.R. Co., 342\nU.S. 359 (1952); Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U.S. 22 (1923). Since the oversight in interpretation ought to be susceptible of clarification by a\nfurther interpretation, it would be most unfortunate if, as is intimated in your\nmemorandum, the matter would have to be rectified by state legislation. A request\nfor, or enactment of, legislation on this point in one state might unnecessarily give\nrise to confusion and doubts in the other judicial districts of the United States\nwhere, so far as we know, no similar difficulty has been encountered under\ncomparable state law. No doubt you have available suitable means of raising the question with Attorney General Ervin, in order to bring about the desired correction. We might add\nthat this office has in the past enjoyed good relationships with his office on a\nnumber of matters, and we would be quite willing to do whatever we can to assist. J. LEE RANKIN\nAssistant Attorney General\nExecutive Adjudications Division 156"
