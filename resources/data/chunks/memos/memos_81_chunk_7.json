  "chunk_text": "Thus it is a\ntraditional rule that “subsequent legislative history” is entitled to little\nweight in matters of statutory interpretation. See, e.g., TVA v. Hill,\n185 supra; Regional Rail Reorganization A ct Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 132 (1974);\nAllyn v. United States, 461 F.2d 810, 811 (Ct. Cl. 1972); 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction § 48.16 (Sands ed. 1973). In accordance with that rule, even if Senator Magnuson’s statements\nhad been made, not in a letter to the Director of CSA, but in a\nsubsequent committee report or a subsequent congressional debate, they\nw ould carry little force as a matter o f interpretation and would not be a\nsufficient basis for altering the conclusion that seems to be required by\nthe plain meaning of the statutory language. CSA grantees, and other grantees covered by the rider, may not use\nappropriated funds to engage in activities designed to influence legisla­\ntion pending before Congress. T h e o d o r e B.
