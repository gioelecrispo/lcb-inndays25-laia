These statements, however, have given way to the modem\nview that a nation exercises the same full sovereignty over its territorial sea as it exercises over its territory on\nland. Convention on the Territorial Sea, pt. I, art I, 15 U.S T. at 1608; Restatement Third § 513(1 )(a). The no­\ntion that a nation is less than fully sovereign over its territorial sea is now considered archaic. See Restatement\nThird § 512, reporters’ note 1.\n4 The only qualification on a nation’s sovereignty within its temtorial sea is that all ships enjoy a nght of inno­\ncent passage. Convention on the Temtorial Sea, pt. I, art 14(1), 15 U.S.T. at 1610; Restatement Third § 513(l)(a). The n ght of innocent passage is extended to warships so long as their passage is not prejudicial to the peace, good\norder, or security of the coastal state. Id , pt. 1, arts. 14(4), 22, 23, 15 U.S.T. at 1610, 1612. The nght o f innocent\npassage also extends to submarines as long as they are navigating on the surface and show their flag. Id , pt. I, art. 14(6), 15U S .T . at 1610.\n5 The high seas are open to all nations; no nation may claim sovereignty over any part of the high seas Con­\nvention on the High Seas, Apr. 29, 1958, art. 2, 13 U.S T. 2313, 2314. Both the United States and the Soviet Union\nare parties to the Convention on the High Seas.\n6 The contiguous zone is the part of the high seas that borders the temtorial sea. Convention on the Temtorial\nSea, pt. II, art 24(1), 15 U S.T. at 1612, Restatement Third § 511(b). The continental shelf includes the sea-bed\nand the subsoil o f the submarine areas that extend from the coast to the outer edge of the continental margin (or, if\nthe continental margin does not extend so far, to a distance of not more than two hundred miles) Restatement Third\n§ 51 1(c). The EEZ extends from the coast to no further than two hundred miles from the coast. Id. § 5 1 1(d). 240 15 U.S.T. at 1612.7 A nation’s authority over its continental shelf is restricted to\nthe exploration and exploitation of natural resources. Restatement Third § 515(1). A nation’s authority within its EEZ is restricted to activities for economic ex­\nploration and exploitation, scientific research, and the protection of the environ­\nment. Id. § 514(1). Outside these areas, a nation has no jurisdiction over the ac­\ntivities of other nations. Convention on the High Seas, Apr. 29, 1958, art. 2, 13\nU.S.T. 2313,2314. In sum, the United States may exercise full sovereign power within its territo­\nrial sea, while exercising more limited kinds of jurisdiction in three overlapping\nportions of the high seas—the contiguous zone, the continental shelf, and the\nEEZ.8\nII. Constitutional Authority to Extend the Territorial Sea The question of where the power to extend the territorial sea resides under our\nconstitutional scheme is novel and complex."
