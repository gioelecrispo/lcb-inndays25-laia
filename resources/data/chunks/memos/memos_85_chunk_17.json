  "chunk_text": "Most recently,\nDiana Motz was confirmed and appointed to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit in 1994, while her husband, Frederick Motz, was a judge\nfor the District of Maryland. We are not aware of anyone ever proposing that §458 applies to presidential\nappointments of federal judges. In this light, applying §458 to presidential\nappointments of federal judges would represent a novel construction of the statute. We do not reject this construction, however, because it is novel. We reject it\nbecause it is contrary to the statute’s language, structure, and purpose, as well\nas the consistent practice under that statute from the date of its enactment. WALTER DELLINGER\nAssistant Attorney General\nOffice o f Legal Counsel 363"
