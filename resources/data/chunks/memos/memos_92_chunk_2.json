More specifically,\nthe Parent wants the retired officer to provide information related to\nhis observations about security and defense, areas within the retired\nofficer’s expertise. The Parent desires for the retired officer to ask\nquestions and seek information related to how the Parent’s employees can better protect themselves, including communications regarding the Parent’s scope of work and its coordination of on-site activity. Letter for Marilyn L. Glynn, Acting Director, Office of Government Ethics, from\nMichael R. Rizzo, McKenna, Long & Aldridge LLP, Re: Request for Formal\nAdvisory Opinion Pursuant to 5 CFR 2638.301 et seq. at 3 (May 31, 2005)\n(“Rizzo Letter”). The Parent believes that effective communications on these\nissues between the retired officer and Marine Corps personnel is necessary to\nensure the security of the Company’s employees and will potentially save lives. Id.\nII.\nSection 207(c) of title 18 provides criminal penalties for a “senior [officer] of\nthe executive branch” who\nwithin 1 year after the termination of his or her service or employment as such officer or employee, knowingly makes, with the intent\nto influence, any communication to or appearance before any officer\nor employee of the department or agency in which such person\nserved within 1 year before such termination, on behalf of any other\nperson (except the United States), in connection with any matter on\nwhich such person seeks official action by any officer or employee\nof such department or agency. 18 U.S.C. § 207(c)(1).

Cf. 5 C.F.R. § 2641, app. B (2005) (designating the Department of the\nNavy as “distinct and separate” from other components of the Department of\nDefense for purposes of section 207). And because the Marine Corps is part of the\nDepartment of the Navy, see 32 C.F.R. § 700.204(a) (2004), the prohibition\nextends to communications between the retired officer and Marine Corps personnel in Iraq. At the same time, however, “[s]ection 207 does not by its terms forbid a former\nExecutive Branch official from communication with his former agency in all\ncircumstances.” Memorandum for Stuart M. Gerson, Assistant Attorney General,\nCivil Division, from Daniel L. Koffsky, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office\nof Legal Counsel at 2 (Mar. 15, 1993) (“Gerson Memorandum”). Instead, a\ncommunication is prohibited only if it is made (1) “with the intent to influence”;\n(2) “on behalf of any other person (except the United States)”; and (3) “in\nconnection with any matter on which such person seeks official action.”"
