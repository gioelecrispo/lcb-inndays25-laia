  "chunk_text": "In some instances, immigration\npreinspection is accompanied by U S. Customs clearance as well. Sites containing both immigration and customs\ninspection are generally called “ preclearance” sites See, e.g., Agreement Between the Government of the United\nStates o f America and the G overnment of Canada on Air Transport Preclearance, May 8, 1974, art 1(a), 25 U S T\n763 ( “ U S.-Canada A greem ent” ). Section 235A refers only to preinspection. 276 Section 235A o f the Immigration and Nationality Act nor repealed by passage of section 235A. Specifically, under INA § 103(a)(7),\n8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(7), the Attorney General “ may, with the concurrence of the\nSecretary of State, establish offices of the [INS] in foreign countries.” Pursuant\nto that authority, the INS established and maintains preinspection stations at air­\nports in Canada, Ireland, Bermuda, and several other ports of embarkation in the\nCaribbean. Establishing those stations involved entering into diplomatic negotia­\ntions with the foreign countries involved. See, e.g., U.S.-Canada Agreement, 25\nU.S.T. at 763. In contrast, section 235A requires (and does not merely authorize) the establish­\nment of preinspection stations. Section 235A(a)(l), which is entitled “ New Sta­\ntions,” provides:\nSubject to paragraph (5), not later than October 31, 1998, the\nAttorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall\nestablish and maintain preinspection stations in at least 5 of the\nforeign airports that are among the 10 foreign airports which the\nAttorney General identifies as serving as last points of departure\nfor the greatest numbers of inadmissible alien passengers who\narrive from abroad by air at ports of entry within the United States. Such preinspection stations shall be in addition to any preinspection\nstations established prior to the date of the enactment of such Act\n[September 30, 1996]. Additionally, section 235A(a)(4), which is entitled “ Additional Stations,” pro­\nvides:\nSubject to paragraph (5), not later than October 31, 2000, the\nAttorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall\nestablish preinspection stations in at least 5 additional foreign air­\nports which the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary\nof State, determines, based on the data compiled under paragraph\n(3) and such other information as may be available, would most\neffectively reduce the number of aliens who arrive from abroad by\nair at points of entry within the United States who are inadmissible\nto the United States. Such preinspection stations shall be in addition\nto those established prior to the date of the enactment of such Act\n[September 30, 1996] or pursuant to paragraph (l).2\n2 Section 235A(a)(3), which is referenced in section 235A(a)(4), provides\nNot later than November 1, 1997, and each subsequent November 1, the Attorney General shall compile\ndata identifying —\n(A) the foreign airports which served as last points o f departure for aliens who arrived by air at United\nStates ports o f entry without valid documentation dunng the preceding fiscal years,\n(B) the number and nationality o f such aliens arriving from each such foreign airport, and\nContinued 277 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 24"
