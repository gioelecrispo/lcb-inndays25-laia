  "chunk_text": "This portion of the letter is focused on the question whether\nan intrasession recess of three days or fewer constitutes a recess under the\nRecess Appointments Clause. See id. (“[T]he Senate did not recess intrasession for more than three days at a time for over a year beginning in late\n2007.”); id. at 3 n.2 (“[O]fficial congressional documents define a ‘recess’ as\n‘any period of three or more complete days . . . when either the House of\nRepresentatives or the Senate is not in session.’” (quoting 2003–2004 Congressional Directory 526 n.2 (Joint Comm. on Printing, 108th Cong., comp.\n2003)). The letter (like this opinion, see supra note 13) does not answer that\nquestion. Instead, the letter uses the uncertain status of recess appointments\nduring intrasession recesses of three or fewer days to argue that the possibility of recess appointments did not render New Process Steel moot. Thus, it\ndoes not answer the question addressed here, whether pro forma sessions at\nwhich no business is conducted interrupt a recess that is more than three\ndays long in a manner that would preclude the President from exercising his\nappointment power under the Clause. III. In our judgment, the text of the Constitution and precedent and practice\nthereunder support the conclusion that the convening of periodic pro\nforma sessions in which no business is to be conducted does not have the\nlegal effect of interrupting an intrasession recess otherwise long enough to\nqualify as a “Recess of the Senate” under the Recess Appointments\nClause. In this context, the President therefore has discretion to conclude\nthat the Senate is unavailable to perform its advise-and-consent function\nand to exercise his power to make recess appointments.
