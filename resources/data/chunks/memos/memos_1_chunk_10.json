  "chunk_text": "The relator is under no general constraint to pursue Department o f Justice\nlitigation policies or procedures. 215 2d Sess. 27 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5266, 5292. This stands\nto reason: since the relator’s action is in the name of the United States,\nthe relator seeks a share o f damages inflicted on the United States, and\nany recovery (minus the relator’s moiety) is paid into the Treasury. In cases in which the Attorney General does enter within the initial\nsixty-day period, the government has “primary responsibility for prose­\ncuting the action.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(c)(1). The relator nevertheless has\n“the right to continue as a party to the action.” Id. This participation right\ngives the relator a substantial role in the litigation. The relator has the\nright to a hearing if the Attorney General decides to dismiss the action. Id. § 3730(c)(2)(A). If the Attorney General proposes to settle the case\nbut the relator objects, the settlement may go forward only if “the court\ndetermines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate,\nand reasonable under all the circumstances.” Id. § 3730(c)(2)(B). In addi­\ntion, the relator participates fully at trial, calling witnesses, cross-examining witnesses, and testifying, except that on the government’s motion\n“the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the [relator’s] par­\nticipation.” Id. § 3730(c)(2)(C). In cases primarily conducted by the Attorney General, the relator\nreceives between 15 and 25 percent o f the proceeds, plus reasonable\nexpenses (including attorneys’ fees), as determined by the court. Id. §\n3730(d)(1). Moreover, if the Government decides to pursue its claim in\nsome forum other than a False Claims Act suit — such as an administra­\ntive penalty action — the relator has the same rights in that proceeding\nthat he would have in court. Id. § 3730(c)(5). In short, where the Government decides not to join, the relator con­\nducts the suit as if he were the Attorney General, except that unlike the\nAttorney General he takes no oath o f office, he bears no loyalty to the\nGovernment or continuing responsibility for implementing its policies,\nand he receives up to thirty percent o f the suit’s proceeds. If the\nGovernment enters the suit, the relator continues to represent the United\nStates, subject to the court’s (not the Attorney General’s) control. This\narrangement carries out the purpose that underlay the 1986\nAmendments. Congress’s “overall intent in amending the qui tam section\no f the False Claims Act is to encourage more private enforcement suits.” S. Rep. No. 345 at 23-24. In order to do that, Congress decided to “depu­\ntize ready and able people ... to play an active and constructive role\nthrough their counsel to bring to justice those contractors who over­\ncharge the government.” 132 Cong. Rec. 29,322 (1986). B. The Statute’s Impact The heart o f the statute’s impact derives from the fact that the qui tam\nprovisions interfere with the Attorney General’s discretion whether to ini­\ntiate a suit under the False Claims Act. That interference adversely\n216 affects both the Government’s law enforcement powers and its contract­\ning powers. 1. The Government’s Enforcement Role\na. The decision to initiate litigation."
