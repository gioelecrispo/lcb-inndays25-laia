Security Council Resolution 1441\nFalse statements or omissions in Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction declaration would by themselves\nconstitute a “further material breach” of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441. December 7, 2002 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE COUNSEL TO THE VICE PRESIDENT * You have asked whether the Government of Iraq will have committed a “further material breach” of its international legal obligations, as that term is defined\nin paragraph 4 of United Nations (“U.N.”) Security Council Resolution 1441\n(“UNSCR 1441”), if it makes false statements or omissions in the declaration\nrequired by paragraph 3 of that resolution. 1 In paragraph 3, the Security Council\nrequired that Iraq report on all aspects of its weapons of mass destruction\n(“WMD”) programs. Paragraph 4 finds that false statements or omissions in Iraq’s\nparagraph 3 declaration and failure by Iraq to comply and cooperate with UNSCR\n1441 would constitute a further material breach. We conclude that false statements\nor omissions by themselves represent a material breach of the Security Council\nresolution. We have addressed the meaning of U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding\nIraq in previous opinions. See generally Authority of the President Under Domestic and International Law to Use Military Force Against Iraq, 26 Op.

O.L.C. 190 (2002). As the Security Council\nitself has recognized, Iraq is currently in material breach of pre-existing Security\nCouncil resolutions related to its development of WMD programs, its repression of\nits civilian population, and its threat to international peace and security in the\nregion.

Security Council\nresolutions regarding Iraq. Id. at 158-61. 2\nI.\nUNSCR 1441 reaffirms that the Government of Iraq is already “in material\nbreach of its obligations under relevant resolutions.” S.C. Res. 1441, ¶ 1. It also\nimposes additional obligations on Iraq in order to provide it with “a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions of the\nCouncil.” Id. ¶ 2. Paragraph 3 of UNSCR 1441 requires Iraq to provide a new\ndeclaration disclosing all aspects of its WMD program within 30 days of its\nenactment. As the U.N. Security Council approved UNSCR 1441 on November 8,\n2002, the Iraqi declaration of its WMD program is due by December 8, 2002. Specifically, paragraph 3 requires Iraq to provide to the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, the International Atomic Energy\nAgency, and the Security Council a “currently accurate, full, and complete\ndeclaration of all aspects of its” WMD program. Id. ¶ 3. Paragraph 4 provides\nthat false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by\nIraq pursuant to this resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to\ncomply with, and cooperate fully in the implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq’s obligations\nand will be reported to the Council for assessment in accordance\nwith paragraphs 11 and 12 below. Id. ¶ 4 (emphasis added). Because of its use of the word “and,” paragraph 4 might be misconstrued by\nsome to provide that a “further material breach” has occurred only when Iraq both\nmakes false statements or omissions and fails to comply and cooperate with the\nresolution. Under such an interpretation, the word “and” conveys only a conjunctive meaning. Therefore, false statements or omissions in Iraq’s paragraph 3\ndeclaration alone would not in itself constitute a further material breach. Rather,\nthose false statements or omissions would have to be accompanied by some other 2\nIt is the responsibility of this Office, on behalf of the Attorney General, 28 C.F.R. § 0.25(a) & (e)\n(2002), to provide authoritative opinions for the President on all legal questions, including questions of\ninternational law.

II. In this context, an interpretation of “and” as solely conjunctive is illogical and\ninconsistent with the text and purpose of UNSCR 1441. It is well established that\nthe word “and” is capable of more than one possible construction. In some\ncontexts, “and” conveys a conjunctive meaning, under which all enumerated\nconditions must be satisfied before a particular result is achieved. In other\ncontexts, however, “and” is used disjunctively, in which case any one of among\ntwo or more conditions by itself would be sufficient to trigger a particular result."

In other\ncontexts, however, “and” is used disjunctively, in which case any one of among\ntwo or more conditions by itself would be sufficient to trigger a particular result. Whether the word “and” conveys a conjunctive or disjunctive meaning depends on\nthe context. In this case, examination of the context of UNSCR 1441 demonstrates\nclearly that paragraph 4 uses “and” in the disjunctive sense. Making false statements or omissions in Iraq’s declaration of its WMD programs, without more,\nwould constitute a further material breach of Iraq’s international obligations. A.\nUnder standard approaches to legal interpretation, it has been long established\nthat the word “and” may convey a disjunctive rather than a conjunctive meaning. 3 Determining which usage was intended in a particular provision requires, as\nalways, an examination of the context in which the term appears. As the Supreme\nCourt has explained, in order to give effect to the intention of those who drafted a\ntext, “courts are often compelled to construe ‘or’ as meaning ‘and,’ and again\n‘and’ as meaning ‘or.’” United States v. Fisk, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 445, 447 (1865). See also Union Ins. Co. v. United States, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 759, 764 (1867) (“when\nwe look beyond the mere words to the obvious intent we cannot help seeing that\nthe word ‘or’ must be taken conjunctively”). Such constructions are permitted to\neffectuate “[t]he obvious purpose” of the provision, and are appropriate when\n“[t]he evil intended to be remedied” is “transparent.” Fisk, 70 U.S. at 447. While\npleading for reading “and” in its common conjunctive meaning, the most recent\nedition of Sutherland’s treatise on statutory construction recognizes that\n“[d]isjunctive ‘or’ and [c]onjunctive ‘and’ may be interpreted as substitutes.” 3 Some might object that United States cases on the disjunctive meaning of “and” are not applicable\nto international law. The ordinary meaning of words, purpose, and context are relevant in international\nlegal interpretation, just as they are in American practice. As the Restatement (Third) of Foreign\nRelations Law explains, “an international agreement is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance\nwith the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and\npurpose.” Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law 325(1) (1987). See also Vienna Convention\non the Law of Treaties, art. 31(1) (same). The reasoning of American courts in interpreting “and” is\ntherefore relevant and persuasive with regard to how “and” should be read in light of its context. 219 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 229 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26 1A Norman J.

Indeed, in a press\nrelease announcing its unanimous approval of UNSCR 1441, the Security Council\nstated that “[a]ny false statement or omission in the declaration will be considered\na further material breach of Iraq’s obligations.” UNSCR 1441 Press Release, supra\nnote 1.

Iraq could willfully refuse\ninspections and even engage in military hostilities against U.N. inspectors and the\nU.S. and allied forces protecting them. Under a conjunctive reading of “and,” Iraq\ncould make a full disclosure of its existing WMD programs, and then refuse to\ndisarm and instead re-double its illegal efforts to obtain such weapons and yet still\nnot be in “further material breach of [its] obligations” to the Security Council. Or a\nmaterial breach would not occur if Iraq fully cooperated with U.N. inspectors, but\nutterly failed to provide any disclosure of information related to its WMD\nprograms. Such a result cannot be squared with the text of UNSCR 1441. Paragraph 5 and\nsubsequent provisions of UNSCR 1441 detail Iraq’s specific obligations with\nrespect to inspections and disarmament. Iraqi violations of these provisions, such\nas refusing to allow inspectors into Iraq, or harming inspectors, or concealing\nWMD locations and materials, would constitute a material breach of its obligations under UNSCR 1441. Yet, under the conjunctive construction, the most\nwillful violations of its inspection obligations would not constitute a “further\nmaterial breach” so long as Iraq has not made false statements or omissions in its\nparagraph 3 declaration. Under the conjunctive approach, once Iraq satisfied its\ndeclaration obligations under paragraph 3 and refrained from making “false\nstatements or omissions” in that declaration, Iraq would never be vulnerable to a\nfinding of “further material breach of Iraq’s obligations.” Such a construction of 221 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 231 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26 the resolution would render most of UNSCR 1441 a nullity. Only by reading\n“and” in paragraph 4 as disjunctive can we give effect to all of UNSCR 1441. Reading “and” to be conjunctive would also conflict with the very purpose of\nUNSCR 1441. The text of the resolution makes clear that its fundamental purpose\nis to disarm Iraq of WMD. Honest declarations and full and complete access for\ninspectors are merely a means required to meet an end. UNSCR 1441 expressly\nstates that, although Iraq already “has been and remains in material breach of its\nobligations” under prior U.N. Security Council resolutions, the Council would\n“afford Iraq . . . a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations.” S.C. Res. 1441, ¶¶ 1-2 (emphasis added).

Events surrounding the passage of UNSCR 1441 further demonstrate that the\ncore purpose of the resolution is to secure Iraqi disarmament. On October 25,\n2002, President Bush made clear that the United States would not accept any\nSecurity Council resolution that did not make disarmament its paramount objective. He stated that “any resolution that evolves must be one which does the job of\nholding Saddam Hussein to account. That includes a rigorous, new and vibrant\ninspections regime, the purpose of which is disarmament, not inspections for the\nsake of inspections.” 11 After the Council approved UNSCR 1441, President Bush\nstated that, “[w]ith the resolution just passed, . . . Saddam Hussein must fully\ndisclose and destroy his weapons of mass destruction. . . . Any act of delay or\ndefiance will be an additional breach of Iraq’s international obligations. . . . Any\nIraqi noncompliance . . . will show that Iraq has no intention of disarming.” 12 In its\npress release announcing its unanimous approval of UNSCR 1441, the Security\nCouncil reiterated that the resolution merely “afford[ed]” Iraq “a ‘final opportunity\nto comply’ with its disarmament obligations.” UNSCR 1441 Press Release, supra\nnote 1. That announcement also quotes U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who\napplauded the resolution and said that “[t]he goal is to ensure the peaceful\ndisarmament of Iraq in compliance with Council resolutions and a better, more\nsecure future for its people.” Id.

These remarks demonstrate that Iraq’s\nfundamental obligation is disarmament, and that honest declarations by themselves\ncannot immunize Iraq from a finding that it has committed a “further material\nbreach of [its] obligations.” Representatives from the other member nations of the Security Council have\nmade similar statements. For example, United Kingdom representative Jeremy\nGreenstock said that “[t]he resolution made crystal clear that Iraq was being given\na final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations.

Id. Richard\nRyan of Ireland explained that “[t]he resolution was about disarming Iraq,” and\nthat “[t]he Council had given Iraq an opportunity to comply with its disarmament\nobligations.” Id.

We have found no evidence, moreover, to suggest that any member nation of\nthe Security Council believed that noncompliance with inspections or Iraqi refusal\nto disarm would not constitute a “further material breach” under UNSCR 1441, so\nlong as Iraq provided a complete and accurate disclosure of its WMD program. In\nlight of the apparent consensus that Iraq’s fundamental obligation was disarmament, it is unsurprising that no pre-enactment history adopts a conjunctive\napproach to paragraph 4 or asserts that honest declarations by themselves could\nprevent a finding of “further material breach of Iraq’s obligations.” III.
