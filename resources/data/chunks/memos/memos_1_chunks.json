Private qui tam actions violate the doctrine of Article III standing because the relator has\nsuffered no personal “injury in fact.” The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act violate the separation of powers doctrine\nbecause they impermissibly infringe on two aspects of the President’s authority to exe­\ncute the laws: the discretion whether to prosecute a claim and the authority to control\nthe conduct of litigation brought to enforce the Government’s interests.

The Issue The issue presented here is whether the so-called “qui tam” provisions\no f the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733 ( “Act”), are constitution­\nal. This may well be the most important separation o f powers question\nyou will have to address as Attorney General. In these qui tam provisions, Congress purports to authorize any person\nto prosecute — on behalf o f the United States and in the name o f the\nUnited States — a civil fraud for treble damages and penalties against any\nperson who allegedly makes a false claim to the U.S. government. Unlike\nnormal citizen suits, the qui tam plaintiff — or so-called “relator” — is\n^ E d ito r’s N o te : This memorandum was not intended to present the official position o f the Department\no f Justice at the time o f its writing, but rather was intended to contribute to a discussion within the\nDepartment over what position should be adopted The views on the Appointments Clause expressed in\nthe memorandum have been superseded by a subsequent O ffice o f Legal Counsel memorandum. See\nMemorandum fo r the General Counsels o f the Federal Government from Walter Dellinger, Assistant\nAttorney General, Office o f Legal Counsel, Re. The Constitutional Separation o f Poivers between the\nPresident and Congress 20-21 n 53 (May 7, 1996) (to be published)\n1 207 empowered to sue, on the government’s behalf, even if he has not sus­\ntained any personal injury as a result o f the wrongdoer’s alleged miscon­\nduct. As a bounty for prosecuting the fraud, the relator receives up to\nthirty percent o f any damages and penalties recovered, with the balance\npaid into the U.S. Treasury. The relator is empowered to prosecute the\ngovernment’s claim even when the Attorney General has determined that\nthere is no valid claim or that pursuing the suit is not in the interests o f\nthe United States."

Through qui tam, Congress has attempted to create universal standing\nto prosecute purely public offenses. These qui tam suits pose a devastat­\ning threat to the Executive’s constitutional authority and to the doctrine\no f separation o f powers. If qui tam suits are upheld, it would mean\nCongress will have carte blanche to divest the executive branch o f its\nconstitutional authority to enforce the laws and vest that authority in its\nown corps o f private bounty hunters. Simply by attaching a penalty to the\nviolation o f any law and by offering a bounty to any person who sues,\nCongress effectively could “privatize” all civil law enforcement. Indeed,\nthrough this device, Congress has authorized each o f its own members\n(as any “person”) to enforce the laws directly. In several qui tam suits currently pending in federal district court,\ndefendant contractors have moved to dismiss, contending that the qui\ntam mechanism is unconstitutional. Several courts have asked the\nDepartment o f Justice to express a position. The Office o f Legal Counsel,\nthe Civil Division, and the former Office o f Legal Policy all agree that the\nqui tam provisions in the False Claims Act are unconstitutional. We\nbelieve they violate the Appointments Clause, infringe on the President’s\ncore Article II authority to execute the law, and violate Article III stand­\ning doctrine. The Civil Division would like to enter an appropriate case\nand, either as amicus or by intervention, present the executive branch’s\narguments against the constitutionality o f qui tam. The Solicitor General\nargues that we should intervene in district court to support the constitu­\ntionality o f qui tam. B. Background The use o f qui tam suits arose in fourteenth century England as an aid\nto government’s primitive law enforcement capabilities. These statutes\nauthorized private “informers” to bring criminal prosecutions for viola­\ntion o f certain penal laws. Upon conviction of the wrongdoer, the private\nprosecutor was given a share o f the penalty as a reward. While some\nstatutes permitted prosecution only by a person who had suffered injury,\nother statutes authorized “any person,” regardless o f ir\\jury, to prosecute\na wrongdoer in the name o f the sovereign for violation o f a penal law. Initially, these informer actions were brought by criminal indictment or\ninformation, but eventually informers could opt to bring their suits as\n208 either a criminal or civil action. This experiment with private law\nenforcement had an unhappy history o f abuse. Qui tam suits fell into dis­\nfavor and, from the sixteenth century forward, their use was progres­\nsively curtailed. In the United States, during the emergency o f the Civil War, Congress\nresorted to this archaic device in response to widespread contractor\nfraud. The False Claims Act o f 1863, 12 Stat. 696, authorized any person\nto prosecute, in the name o f the United States, a civil action against a con­\ntractor for alleged fraud against the United States."

As a reward, the rela­\ntor received a share o f any recovery. After the Civil War, this qui tam\nstatute fell into relative desuetude. By 1986, except for a flurry o f activi­\nty during World War II, it had become an anachronism. In 1986, Congress, dissatisfied with the way the executive branch was\nenforcing government procurement laws, sought to breathe new life into\nthis dormant device. To stimulate private enforcement suits, Congress\namended the False Claims Act to provide for treble damages and penal­\nties o f up to $10,000 for each false claim, and to provide for a bounty to\nthe relator o f up to thirty percent o f any recovery (the “ 1986 Amend­\nments”). The congressional proponents o f these amendments made no\npretense about the fact that they distrusted the executive’s willingness or\nability to enforce the law properly, and they stated that their purpose was\nto “deputize” private citizens to ensure effective law enforcement. In the two years since enactment o f the 1986 Amendments, there has\nbeen a massive upsurge in qui tam actions — over 150 suits have been\nfiled. These actions have disrupted the civil and criminal enforcement\nactivities o f the Department. See Memorandum for the Solicitor General,\nfrom Stuart E. Schiffer, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division\n(June 15, 1989). They have also undermined the executive’s ability to\nadminister complex procurement contracts and, in some cases, have\ncaused serious national security concerns. The 1986 Amendments have\nalso spawned the formation o f full-time “bounty hunting” groups —\nersatz departments o f justice — that go about prosecuting civil fraud\nactions in the name o f the United States. C. Qui Tam’s Unconstitutionality The Office o f Legal Counsel believes that the qui tam provisions o f the\nFalse Claims Act are patently unconstitutional. In our view, this is not\neven a close question. Our conclusion rests on three grounds. First, we believe that private qui tam actions violate the Appointments\nClause o f the Constitution. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. The Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly held that conducting litigation on behalf o f the United States\nto enforce the rights o f the United States must be carried out by an exec­\nutive branch official or other properly appointed government officer. The\nConstitution thus does not permit Congress to vest governmental law\n209 enforcement authority in self-selected private parties, who have not been\nit\\jured and who act from mercenary motives, without commitment to the\nUnited States’ interests and without accountability. Second, we believe qui tam suits violate Article III standing doctrine. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that under Article III, a plaintiff\nis ineligible to invoke federal judicial power unless he can demonstrate\nthat he has suffered “ir\\jury in fact” as a result o f the defendant’s alleged­\nly illegal conduct. Qui tam relators suffer no ii\\jury in fact and thus fail to\nmeet this bedrock constitutional requirement."

      "content": "Qui tam relators suffer no ii\\jury in fact and thus fail to\nmeet this bedrock constitutional requirement. Because Congress may not\nabrogate this requirement, the False Claims Act’s grant o f universal\nstanding to any person violates Article III. Third, we believe that qui tam actions violate the doctrine o f separation\no f powers. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the authority\nto enforce the laws is a core power vested in the Executive. The False\nClaims Act effectively strips this power away from the Executive and\nvests it in private individuals, depriving the Executive o f sufficient super­\nvision and control over the exercise o f these sovereign powers. The Act\nthus impermissibly infringes on the President’s authority to ensure faith­\nful execution o f the laws. Until now, no federal court has ever considered or addressed the con­\nstitutionality o f qui tam actions. Nor, to our knowledge, has any Attorney\nGeneral ever conceded the constitutionality o f the device. Indeed, in\n1943, Attorney General Biddle called for its repeal. He contended that it\nwas the duty o f the Department o f Justice to enforce the laws and that qui\ntam suits interfered with that responsibility. During these debates in 1943,\na leading Senate proponent o f qui tam complained:\n[T]he Congress enacted that statute in 1863. I ask any\nSenator to name one case, from 1863 until 1942, in which\nthe Attorney General o f the United States tried to enforce\nthe statute. From the day the statute went on the statute\nbooks to the present, the Attorneys General, whether\nDemocrats or Republicans, fought it. 89 Cong. Rec. 10,697 (1943) (emphasis added). D. Reasons fo r Opposing Q u i Tam In my view, the Department o f Justice has an obligation to the President\nand to the Constitution to .resist this encroachment on executive power. Consequently, I recommend that the Civil Division be permitted to present\nthe executive branch’s arguments against the constitutionality o f the qui\ntam device. I submit that three considerations dictate this course. First, qui tam poses a potentially devastating threat to the President’s\nconstitutional authority. If qui tam is upheld, there would be nothing to\n210 prevent Congress from using the device to eviscerate all o f the executive\nbranch’s civil law enforcement authority. We can expect to see the inex­\norable extension o f qui tam into such areas as securities fraud, savings\nand loan fraud, and civil rights. Once the facial constitutionality o f the\ndevice is conceded, there is no principled basis for limiting its future use. As Justice Scalia noted with regard to the independent counsel statute:\nFrequently an issue o f this sort will come before the\nCourt clad, so to speak, in sheep’s clothing: the potential o f\nthe asserted principle to effect important change in the\nequilibrium o f power is not immediately evident, and must\nbe discerned by a careful and perceptive analysis. But this\nwolf comes as a wolf. Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 699 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting). The rationale for the special prosecutor statute at least can be restricted to\nnarrow circumstances."

The rationale for the special prosecutor statute at least can be restricted to\nnarrow circumstances. Qui tam is far more dangerous: there is simply no\nway to cage this beast. Not only would qui tam work a sea change in the balance o f power\nbetween the Congress and the Executive, but it would, in my view, under­\nmine the liberties o f the American people — which is what the doctrine\no f separation o f powers ultimately is designed to safeguard. One o f the\ncentral tenets o f the Framers was that the power to execute the law must\nbe kept in hands that are both independent o f the legislature and politi­\ncally accountable to the people. This enforcement structure was\ndesigned to protect the people from the improvident or tyrannical\nenforcement o f the laws. Qui tam allows Congress to circumvent the\nExecutive’s check and to have its laws enforced directly by its own pri­\nvate bounty hunters. This destroys the longstanding principle that all\nthree branches must concur before the sovereign may exact public penal­\nties from an individual. The second consideration that dictates opposing the constitutionality\no f qui tam is the very force o f the arguments against it. Taken together —\nor taken alone — the three constitutional objections against qui tam are\nformidable. Indeed, as a matter o f principle, they are irresistible. They are\nby no means extreme arguments. On the contrary, they are — as the\nSolicitor General would acknowledge — well within the mainstream and\nfirmly rooted in the consistent rulings o f the Supreme Court. To date, the\nSupreme Court has been unyielding in its insistence both upon “injury in\nfact” as the essential requirement o f standing and upon strict compliance\nwith the Appointments Clause whenever significant governmental\nauthority is vested in an individual. But even if it were a close question — and I do not think that it is — it\nis not our job, when the President’s core constitutional powers are at\nstake, to “decide” these cases as if we were an Article III judge. We are\n211 the Executive’s only advocates, and when the President’s core powers are\nat stake, the Executive’s case is so compelling, and the practical conse­\nquences o f defeat so grave, w e have a duty to advance the President’s\ncause. Indeed, the Framers expected that a “great security” against the\ngradual erosion o f the separation o f powers was precisely the willingness\nand disposition o f each branch’s officers to resist the encroachments o f\nthe others: “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.” The\nFederalist No. 51, at 349 (James Madison) (Jacob E. Cooke ed. 1961). The third consideration that dictates opposing qui tam relates to the\nposture o f these cases. Because o f the unusual way these cases arise, we\nhave nothing to lose by challenging the constitutionality o f qui tam. The\nDepartment o f Justice is not a formal party to these cases. Private defen­\ndants, ably represented, have directly challenged the constitutionality o f\nthe qui tam provisions."

The\nDepartment o f Justice is not a formal party to these cases. Private defen­\ndants, ably represented, have directly challenged the constitutionality o f\nthe qui tam provisions. The U.S. Senate has filed amicus briefs in support\no f qui tam. The fundamental powers o f the President are thus being\ndecided in our absence. This is not a case in which we have the freedom\nto pick where or when to fight. This litigation will proceed with or with­\nout us and will undoubtedly end up in the Supreme Court. As Madison noted, because o f the breadth o f the constitutional powers\no f the legislative branch, that branch easily can “mask under complicat­\ned and indirect measures, the encroachments which it makes on the co­\nordinate departments.” The Federalist No. 48, at 334 (James Madison)\n(Jacob E. Cooke ed. 1961). Madison therefore found it often to be a “ques­\ntion o f real-nicety” whether a particular measure would extend beyond\nthe legislature’s sphere. Id. Despite the difficulties perceived by the\nSolicitor General, no such “question o f real-nicety” is involved here. If we\nfail to object to qui tam, it almost certainly will be upheld. If we enter the\ncase and vigorously contest qui tarn’s constitutionality, we stand a good\nchance o f winning or, at least, obtaining a decision that restricts qui tam. Thus, this is a case in which w e will be in no worse position if we go in\nand lose than we are in right now. In short, there is no “downside” here,\nand this is precisely the kind o f case where we should be aggressively\nresisting encroachment. E. The Solicitor General’s Position The Solicitor General admits that qui tam poses “grave dangers” to the\nPresidency. See Memorandum for the Solicitor General, from Richard G.\nTaranto, Assistant to the Solicitor General at 3, 10-11 (June 26, 1989)\n( “Taranto Memo”). He appears to perceive the issue o f qui tarn’s constitu­\ntionality as a “close” one. See id. at 3. Nevertheless, he is recommending\nthat the Department intervene in district court to support the facial con­\nstitutionality o f the qui tam statute. The Solicitor General’s position would\nrequire the surrender at the outset o f the two strongest arguments against\nqui tam — the Appointments Clause and Article III standing arguments. 212 The Solicitor General assures us, however, that he will reserve the right to\nuse a separation o f powers balancing test to defend against encroachment\nif qui tam is unconstitutionally applied in the future. Id. at 12-14. To uphold qui tam, the Solicitor General is prepared to disregard\ndecades o f clear Supreme Court jurisprudence and the application o f wellsettled constitutional principles. His sole reason for embracing qui tam is\nits historical usage. Id. at 4-5. This argument — that past usage alone is\nenough to establish a practice’s constitutionality — is untenable both as a\nmatter o f history and o f law."

This argument — that past usage alone is\nenough to establish a practice’s constitutionality — is untenable both as a\nmatter o f history and o f law. Moreover, the Solicitor General’s proposed\nstrategy o f preemptive concession makes no sense as a litigation tactic. The Solicitor General vastly overstates the historical acceptance o f qui\ntam. Prior to passage o f the False Claims Act, the only significant use o f\nqui tam occurred in the Federalist period, during which time it appears\nthat perhaps six statutes were enacted that may have authorized penalty\nactions by private persons. These statutes involved relatively arcane\nareas; one set fines for illegally trading with the Indians, another set fines\nfor misconduct by census-takers. The record, however, is most unclear as\nto whether these statutes reflected any appreciable acceptance o f qui\ntam actions by persons who had sustained no injury. It appears from actu­\nal practice that with very few exceptions, suits under these statutes were\nbrought either by government officials (for whom the moiety was com­\npensation) or by persons who had suffered injury in fact. There is little\nevidence that the long-accepted historical practice on which the Solicitor\nGeneral relies ever existed. It is easy to understand why qui tam has been so marginal a practice in\nthe history o f federal law. Adopted when the Executive was embryonic,\nthe early qui tam statutes were essentially stop-gap measures, confined to\nnarrow circumstances in which the government lacked the institutions to\nenforce the law. The intent o f those statutes was to assist a fledgling\nexecutive, not supplant it. As the Executive’s law enforcement capabili­\nties gathered strength, qui tam rapidly fell into disuse. A fair reading o f\nthe history o f qui tam in the United States reveals it as a transitory and\naberrational device that never gained a secure foothold within our con­\nstitutional structure because o f its fundamental incompatibility with that\nstmcture. Moreover, even strong historical support for qui tam could not cure the\npractice’s constitutional -infirmities. No Supreme Court case has ever\ngiven history the kind o f dispositive weight that the Solicitor General\nwould here. On the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stated\nthat history alone can never validate a practice that is contrary to consti­\ntutional principle, even when the practice “covers our entire national\nexistence and indeed predates it.” Walz v. Taac Commission, 397 U.S. 664,\n678 (1970). Accord Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 790 (1983). There\nare numerous examples o f statutes passed by the early congresses that\nhave been held unconstitutional or clearly would be held unconstitution­\n213 al today. See infra p. 233. Thus, if a past practice cannot be reconciled\nwith constitutional principle, an appeal to history alone cannot sustain it. In the case o f qui tam, absent the invocation o f history there is no ques­\ntion about the practice’s unconstitutionality. Although history alone cannot validate a plainly unconstitutional prac­\ntice, the Supreme Court has indicated that close cases will be resolved in\nfavor o f the constitutionality o f certain strong historical traditions."

The\nCourt weighs several factors in determining the authority o f a tradition,\nincluding (1) whether there is evidence that the Framers actually consid­\nered the constitutional implications o f their actions; (2) whether the prac­\ntice is so longstanding and pervasive that it has become “part o f the fab­\nric o f our society;” and (3) whether the practice can be accommodated\nwithin the constitutional framework in a way that does not undermine\nsettled principles. See, e.g., Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils,\n487 U.S. 787 (1987); Marsh v. Chambers-, Walz v. Tax Commission. Qui tam would deserve no deference under these criteria. There is no\nevidence that the Framers considered the constitutional status o f qui\ntam. On the contrary, the early statutes are the kind to which the Court\ngives no weight — “action ... taken thoughtlessly, by force o f long tradi­\ntion and without regard to the problems posed.” Marsh v. Chambers, 463\nU.S. at 791. Nor can it seriously be maintained that qui tam is “part o f the\nfabric o f our society.” Never more than a marginal device, it is today an\nanachronism that easily can be excised without disruption. Qui tarn’s\nprinciple o f private law enforcement, however, is so fundamentally\nincompatible with established doctrines o f standing and separation of\npowers that, if accepted, it would substantially undermine these doc­\ntrines. Thus, qui tam is not merely an innocuous historical oddity that can\nbe narrowly accommodated, but is, by nature, an exception that will con­\nsume the rule. Further, the Solicitor General’s use o f history is internally inconsistent. None o f the old qui tam statutes upon which the Solicitor General relies\nallowed the Attorney General to intervene once the relator brought the\ncase. However, the Solicitor General concludes that the current statute\nwill be unconstitutional if it is applied to limit the Attorney General’s par­\nticipation in the suit. It is difficult to understand how the Solicitor\nGeneral can give dispositive historical weight to statutes that would be\nunconstitutional under his theory for arguing qui tarn’s validity. Finally, as a tactical matter, the Solicitor General’s strategy of preemp­\ntive concession is extremely unwise. It voluntarily surrenders at the out­\nset the two strongest objective arguments against qui tam. Once those are\nabandoned, all that will remain to protect the President’s interests will be\na subjective balancing approach and the argument that at some unde­\nfined point the degree of encroachment will become unbearable. This\napproach leaves executive powers entirely vulnerable to an adverse judi­\ncial decision. 214 II. THE STATUTE AND ITS IMPACT\nA. The Statute The False Claims Act provides that anyone who presents a false money\nclaim to the Federal Government shall be liable for double or treble dam­\nages and civil penalties o f up to $10,000 per false claim. 31 U.S.C. § 3729."

Under the qui tam provisions of the Act, any person may bring a civil\naction “for the person and for the United States Government” to recover\ndamages and penalties. Id. § 3730(b)(1). The qui tam action, although ini­\ntiated by a private person called a relator, is “brought in the name o f the\nGovernment.” Id. The details o f the qui tam mechanism demonstrate that the real party\nin interest is the United States, with the relator functioning as attorney\nfor the United States. When a private person brings a qui tam action, he\nmust serve on the Government the complaint and a written disclosure o f\nthe information he possesses. Id. § 3730(b)(2). The Attorney General is\nthen forced to decide, within 60 days, whether to “intervene and proceed\nwith the action.” Id. By the end o f that period, the Attorney General must\ninform the court whether the government shall proceed; if not, “the per­\nson bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action.” Id. §\n3730(b)(4)(B). Where the Attorney General decides not to proceed with the case, the\nrelator alone represents the government. He has full control over the lit­\nigation, including discovery, admissions, and presentation o f evidence,\nsubject only to a few specific limitations. 1If the relator prevails, most o f\nthe recovery is paid into the Treasury, with the relator keeping between\ntwenty-five and thrity percent as his reward. Id. § 3730(d)(2). The relator\nis also entitled to attorneys’ fees. Id. If the Attorney General initially declines to proceed with the case, he\nmay intervene later only upon a showing of “good cause,” but such inter­\nvention does not limit “the status and rights o f the person initiating the\naction.” Id. § 3730(c)(3). Thus, the relator retains primary control over\nthe case despite the government’s intervention. Moreover, the legislative\nhistory to the 1986 Amendments expressly states that any judgment or\nsettlement in a case conducted exclusively by the relator binds the\nGovernment under principles o f preclusion. S. Rep. No. 345, 99th Cong., 1 A qui tam action may be dismissed only if the court and the Attorney General give written consent. 31 U.S.C. § 3730(b)(1) If ihe Government shows that discovery by the relator would interfere with ongo­\ning civil or criminal investigations or prosecutions, the court may stay discovery for a penod not to\nexceed 60 days The court may impose further stays if the Attorney General shows “that the Government\nhas pursued the cnminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any pro­\nposed discovery in the Iqui tamj action will interfere with the ongoing cnminal or civil investigation or\nproceedings ” Id § 3730(c)(4). The relator is under no general constraint to pursue Department o f Justice\nlitigation policies or procedures. 215 2d Sess. 27 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5266, 5292."

This stands\nto reason: since the relator’s action is in the name of the United States,\nthe relator seeks a share o f damages inflicted on the United States, and\nany recovery (minus the relator’s moiety) is paid into the Treasury. In cases in which the Attorney General does enter within the initial\nsixty-day period, the government has “primary responsibility for prose­\ncuting the action.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(c)(1). The relator nevertheless has\n“the right to continue as a party to the action.” Id. This participation right\ngives the relator a substantial role in the litigation. The relator has the\nright to a hearing if the Attorney General decides to dismiss the action. Id. § 3730(c)(2)(A). If the Attorney General proposes to settle the case\nbut the relator objects, the settlement may go forward only if “the court\ndetermines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate,\nand reasonable under all the circumstances.” Id. § 3730(c)(2)(B). In addi­\ntion, the relator participates fully at trial, calling witnesses, cross-examining witnesses, and testifying, except that on the government’s motion\n“the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the [relator’s] par­\nticipation.” Id. § 3730(c)(2)(C). In cases primarily conducted by the Attorney General, the relator\nreceives between 15 and 25 percent o f the proceeds, plus reasonable\nexpenses (including attorneys’ fees), as determined by the court. Id. §\n3730(d)(1). Moreover, if the Government decides to pursue its claim in\nsome forum other than a False Claims Act suit — such as an administra­\ntive penalty action — the relator has the same rights in that proceeding\nthat he would have in court. Id. § 3730(c)(5). In short, where the Government decides not to join, the relator con­\nducts the suit as if he were the Attorney General, except that unlike the\nAttorney General he takes no oath o f office, he bears no loyalty to the\nGovernment or continuing responsibility for implementing its policies,\nand he receives up to thirty percent o f the suit’s proceeds. If the\nGovernment enters the suit, the relator continues to represent the United\nStates, subject to the court’s (not the Attorney General’s) control. This\narrangement carries out the purpose that underlay the 1986\nAmendments. Congress’s “overall intent in amending the qui tam section\no f the False Claims Act is to encourage more private enforcement suits.” S. Rep. No. 345 at 23-24. In order to do that, Congress decided to “depu­\ntize ready and able people ... to play an active and constructive role\nthrough their counsel to bring to justice those contractors who over­\ncharge the government.” 132 Cong. Rec. 29,322 (1986). B. The Statute’s Impact The heart o f the statute’s impact derives from the fact that the qui tam\nprovisions interfere with the Attorney General’s discretion whether to ini­\ntiate a suit under the False Claims Act. That interference adversely\n216 affects both the Government’s law enforcement powers and its contract­\ning powers. 1. The Government’s Enforcement Role\na. The decision to initiate litigation."

The decision to initiate litigation. First and most obviously, the qui\ntam mechanism removes from the Department’s hands the decision\nwhether and when to commence an action. Once a relator files his com­\nplaint, we have 60 days within which to decide whether to join. This is\ntrue even if we are pursuing an investigation that is far from ready for\ndecision whether to prosecute. 2 In several cases, district courts already\nhave refused to grant us extensions in order to avoid interference with\nongoing criminal investigations. See, e.g., United States ex rel. McCoy v.\nCalifornia Medical Review Inc., 723 F. Supp. 1363 (N.D. Cal. 1989).3 If a\nstay is unavailable, the civil case proceeds with or without us, sometimes\nalerting targets o f criminal investigations; sometimes resulting in disclo­\nsure of key information in our possession, including our litigating posi­\ntions; and sometimes complicating attempts to prepare a comprehensive\nplea arrangement and civil settlement. In addition, informal avenues o f redress and adjustment can be cut off. Instead, the Government may be forced to choose quickly between leaving\nthe suit wholly to the relator or taking the very serious step o f charging\nfraud against a private person. 4 Such a charge is a serious matter, whether\nbrought by the Department or a relator. In many cases prosecutorial discre­\ntion would counsel against our bringing a False Claims Act suit; for exam­\nple, we might find that although a contractor was technically liable, it has\nfired the employees responsible for the fraud. A relator, however, is inter­\nested only in money, not in the faithful execution o f the laws. He has taken\nno oath o f office, has no obligation of loyalty to the Government or its inter­\nests, and has no continuing responsibility for the governmental programs at\nissue. Rather, he holds a personal financial stake that in all other contexts\nwould disqualify him from representing the Government’s interests. United States ex rel. Hyatt v. Northrop Corp., No. CV 87-6892 KN (Jrx), 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18940 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 27, 1989), provides an 2 Contrary to our experience, the Senate Committee believed that “with the vast majority o f cases, 60\ndays is an adequate amount o f time to allow Government coordination, review and decision\" o f fraud\nactions running into millions or billions o f dollars. S Rep No. 345 at 24-25.\n3 This accords with the legislative history, which states that “the Committee does not intend that crim­\ninal investigations be considered an automatic bar to proceeding with a civil fraud suit.\" S. Rep N o 345\nat 25. Instead, the Senate Committee stated that if the Government obtains an initial stay, “the court\nshould carefully scrutinize any additional Government requests for extensions by evaluating the\nGovernment’s progress with its cnminal inquiry” Id\n4 In some circumstances, w e may be considering enforcement action less draconian than a trebledamages-plus-penalties action under the False Claims Act."

Once a relator has ensured that there will be\na treble-damages action, however, we may be forced either to scrap a single-damage suit or attempt to\nhandle it in coryunction with the other. 217 example o f a case in which the qui tam provisions have allowed a relator\nto force a suit that this Department would not have pursued. In that case,\neight employees are suing Northrop for alleged fraud in the manufacture\no f inertial measurement units ( “IMUs”) for the MX (Peacekeeper) Missile. They seek restitution o f $1 billion, $250 million in compensatory dam­\nages, and $5 million in punitive damages. Two o f the eight relators had\nfiled an earlier qui tam action against Northrop that was dismissed\nbecause the information on which it was based was already in the\nGovernment’s possession. The pending suit makes numerous allegations\no f fraud, including that Northrop knowingly delivered defective IMUs to\nthe Air Force, that it failed to test or inspect all components properly, and\nthat it misrepresented the performance o f operation audits and respon­\nsive corrective action. In fact, the Civil Division’s memorandum review­\ning the relators’ suit notes that the complaint is so broad that it encom­\npasses nearly every action undertaken by Northrop in the course o f the\nmanufacture and delivery o f the IMUs. 5 The Civil Division declined to\nenter the relators’ action because extensive investigations o f Northrop’s\noperations by the U.S. Attorney and the Air Force failed to produce evi­\ndence o f fraud. See Civil Division Memo at 8-15. Moreover, the Air Force’s\nrecords show that the actual performance o f the allegedly defective IMUs\nhas far exceeded expectations, thus rebutting the relators’ claims o f\nfraud. See id. at 12. Nevertheless, the relators are permitted by the qui\ntam provisions to continue to pursue their suit on behalf o f the\nGovernment to satisfy their personal purposes, whether for harassment\nor in hopes o f forcing Northrop to pay them a settlement award. b. The conduct of litigation. When we do enter a case, the relator\nretains his rights to participate, which often are exercised in ways\nadverse to the government’s interests. The Civil Division has already\nencountered claims by relators that they, as representatives o f the United\nStates, are entitled access to our investigative files and personnel. Moreover, all disputes between us and the relator over the conduct of the\ncase — from discovery to witness selection to cross-examination — are\ndecided by the court. This leaves open the question whether the Act has\ntransferred the executive power to the relator or the district judge, but it\nis clear that that power has been transferred away from the Attorney\nGeneral. 6 When we do not intervene, the Department nevertheless must spend\nresources monitoring cases that it had for good reason decided not to\nbring.

Bolton, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, from Michael F Hertz, Director, Com m ercial Litigation Branch, at 7 (the “Civil Division Mem o”), recommending that the\nDepartment decline to enter the relators’ suit. GThis arrangement, by which the relator looks over our shoulder at trial, is precisely what Congress\nintended. A t trial, the relator is to act as “a check that the Government does not neglect evidence, cause\nundue delay, o r drop the false claims case without legitimate reason \" S Rep No 345 at 26 218 from a relator’s conduct, we must keep close track of these cases. Other\ndifficulties will also arise; for example, the Civil Division has informed us\nthat in one case a qui tam relator sought to depose a government investi­\ngator who had worked on a grand jury probe o f a contractor other than\nthe qui tam defendant. c. Judgment and settlement. Perhaps the most important interference\ncomes if we seek to settle a case. If we negotiate a settlement but the rela­\ntor objects, the court must determine whether the arrangement is “fair,\nadequate and just” under the circumstances — a judicial role that to our\nknowledge is unique. 7 The perverse results this provision can have are\nreflected in the court’s action in Gravitt v. General Electric Co., 680 F.\nSupp. 1162 (S.D. Ohio), cert, denied, 488 U.S. 901 (1988). In that case, a\nrelator claimed that General Electric had presented false statements to\nthe Defense Department. Many o f General Electric’s records were indeed\nincorrect, but the inaccurate accounting system involved had resulted in\nnet undercharges to the Government. We negotiated a settlement under\nwhich Genera] Electric would pay a substantial penalty and waive its\ncounterclaims growing out o f the undercharges. The relator objected,\nand the district court refused to accept the settlement, lecturing us on the\ninadequacy o f our investigation into the matter, even though the Defense\nDepartment was already quite familiar with the situation.8 A few years\nlater, we succeeded in settling for the original figure. Where we do not enter a qui tam action, the relator either litigates the\ncase to judgment, which binds the United States, S. Rep. No. 345 at 27, or\nsettles it, likewise binding the Government. This may be quite significant. For one thing, a qui tam relator, who has no enforcement interest, may\nallege far more corruption than he can prove. Even if that corruption\nwere real, if the relator could not prove it, a judgment against him on\nthose issues would bar us from acting later. In addition, relators such as\ndischarged employees may bring a qui tam count in conjunction with pri­\nvate causes o f action.

United States, 460 U.S 1001 (1983)\n(Rehnquist, J , join ed by Burger, C.J., and White, J , dissenting). 8 In United States ex rel StillweU v Hughes Helicopters, In c , 714 F. Supp. 1084 (C D Cal 1989), the\ndefendant argued that the qui tam mechanism was unconstitutional on its face and pointed to the distnct\ncourt’s conduct in Gravitt as an example o f an illicit transfer o f authority to the courts. The ju dge in\nStillweU, in upholding the qui tam provisions (which he presumed to be constitutional, since they had not been challenged by the executive branch), replied that the G ravitt court’s views o f our conduct w ere\nentirely reasonable Id. at 1092-93 n.8. This may indicate that in some qui tam cases the courts w ill not\nneed to second-guess our decision to settle, because they will be able to dispose o f the issue by secondguessing our investigative zeal 219 tion o f any payment attributed to them. We must therefore carefully\nreview every qui tam settlement and, if it is defective, try to persuade the\njudge to reject it. Moreover, the collateral effects may go beyond barring further False\nClaims Act litigation. In United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435 (1989), the\nSupreme Court held that civil penalties under the False Claims Act can\nrepresent punishment for purposes o f the Double Jeopardy Clause. The\nCourt specifically left open the question whether a qui tam suit qualifies\nas a suit by the Government for these purposes. Id. at 451 n .ll. If it does,\nwe may be foreclosed by the relator from bringing subsequent criminal\nprosecutions.9 2. The Government as Contractor\nTransfer o f control over the Government’s litigation to private persons\naffects not only our litigation function, but every aspect o f the\nGovernment’s work that can be implicated in a suit under the False\nClaims Act. Any Government contract can give rise to a False Claims Act\naction. For that reason, every routine decision that an agency makes as a\ncontracting party is now subject to the relator’s influence. Any complex contract naturally will produce issues o f construction\nbetween the parties."

For that reason, every routine decision that an agency makes as a\ncontracting party is now subject to the relator’s influence. Any complex contract naturally will produce issues o f construction\nbetween the parties. In the case o f Government contracts, the agency\nconcerned must decide whether contract deviations constitute a breach,\nand sometimes whether a breach amounts to fraud. In making these deci­\nsions, it is frequently in the Government’s interest, as it would be in the\ninterest o f any contracting party, to avoid excessive concern over minor\nfailings that might threaten a useful course o f dealing with the other\nparty. In the Government’s case, especially, the agency must carefully\nconsider such matters where the contract involves important military or\nnational security matters, particularly if there are a limited number o f\nqualified contractors, or the contractor’s performance otherwise has\nbeen adequate or even excellent. Under the 1986 Amendments, however, all such policy decisions poten­\ntially are thrown into the public forum. Relators who have no interest in\nthe smooth execution of the Government’s work have a strong dollar\nstake in alleging fraud whether or not it exists. The possibility o f a qui\ntam suit will therefore lead to a hardening o f positions by the Govern­\nment and the contractor: the contractor must be certain not to be too can­\ndid, while the Government must be scrupulous about even its least sig­\nnificant rights, in order to avoid later second-guessing by a relator and a\ncourt. The ripple effects of qui tam in the Government’s contracting flex­\nibility thus could be enormous. 9 Th ere will also be the nice question o f when jeopardy attaches in a False Claims A ct suit 220 III. QUI TAM SUITS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL\nA. Appointments Clause Violation We believe that qui tam suits brought by private parties to enforce the\nclaims o f the United States plainly violate the Appointments Clause o f the\nConstitution. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. The Supreme Court has made clear that\nexercises o f significant governmental power must be carried out by\n“Officers o f the United States,” duly appointed under the Appointments\nClause. E.g., Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 670-77 (1988); Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976). It is well established that “conducting civil liti­\ngation in the courts o f the United States for vindicating public rights” is\nat the core o f executive power and “may be discharged only by persons\nwho are ‘Officers o f the United States.’” Id. at 140 (emphasis added). See\nalso United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., 125 U.S. 273, 279 (1888) (the\nAttorney General “is undoubtedly the officer who has charge o f the insti­\ntution and conduct o f the pleas o f the United States, and o f the litigation\nwhich is necessary to establish the rights o f the government”);\nConfiscation Cases, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 454, 458-59 (1868) ( “ [S]o far as the\ninterests o f the United States are concerned, [all suits] are subject to the\ndirection, and within the control of, the Attorney-General.”)."

Department of\nJustice, 491 U.S. 440, 482-89 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n(Appointments Clause must be strictly applied; no “balancing” where a\npower has been committed to a particular Branch o f the Government in\nthe text o f the Constitution). Even in Morrison v. Olson, the Court insist­\ned on strict compliance with the Clause’s terms, upholding the use o f spe­\ncial prosecutors only after concluding that (i) the prosecutors were “infe­\nrior” officers, (ii) they were duly appointed by a “Court o f Law” in\naccordance with the Appointments Clause, and (iii) they remained subject\nto sufficient executive control in the initiation and prosecution o f cases. In Buckley, the Court held that Congress violated the Constitution\nwhen it attempted to vest civil litigation authority in a commission whose\nmembers had not been duly appointed under the Appointments Clause. The Court said that “ [a] lawsuit is the ultimate remedy for a breach o f the\nlaw, and it is to the President, and not to the Congress, that the\nConstitution entrusts the responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be\nfaithfully executed.’” 424 U.S. at 138. The qui tam provisions in the False\nClaims Act are equally unconstitutional. Qui tam relators are not appoint­\ned in any o f the ways prescribed by the Appointments Clause and hold no\ncommission under the United States. Yet these relators exercise signifi­\ncant governmental authority by suing to enforce the rights o f the United\nStates in the name o f the United States. Just as Congress cannot vest lit­\nigation authority in commission members who have not been duly\n221 appointed, it cannot vest such litigation authority in self- selected private\nbounty hunters who operate without accountability and without commit­\nment to the United States’ interests. There can be no doubt that qui tam relators are exercising significant\ngovernmental power. Private relators are empowered to level fraud\ncharges against other private citizens and hail them into court to answer\nfor these alleged public offenses, with the possibility o f collecting not\nonly damages but substantial civil penalties. In so doing, the relators are\nempowered to overrule the judgment o f executive officials as to whether\nthe contractor has, in fact, committed fraud and whether it is appropriate\nunder the circumstances to prosecute the Government’s claim. Where the\nAttorney General determines not to proceed with a suit, the relator is\nempowered to prosecute the suit in the Government’s name, controlling\nall aspects o f the litigation and binding the United States by the judgment. I f the Attorney General later decides to intervene, the relator remains in\ncontrol. Even if the Attorney General enters the suit at the outset, the\nrelator remains a party and is empowered to challenge not only the liti­\ngation judgments o f the Government but also any attempt to dismiss or\nsettle the case. It is also beyond dispute that the claim the relator litigates is that o f the\nUnited States. Qui tam relators historically were understood to be suing\nin a representative capacity."

Qui tam relators historically were understood to be suing\nin a representative capacity.

Note, The History and Development o f Qui\nTam, 1972 Wash. U.L.Q. 81,83-84 ( “Washington University Note”). The qui\ntam provisions in the False Claims Act are based precisely on that\npremise. The Act provides that one who files a false claim “is liable to the\nUnited States Government for a civil penalty ..., plus 3 times the amount\no f damages which the Government sustains.” 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a) (empha­\nsis added). In authorizing qui tam suits, the Act provides that the suit\nshall be brought “fo r the United States Government\" and “in the name of\nthe Government.\" Id. § 3730(b)(1) (emphasis added). The history o f the False Claims Act demonstrates that the Act has\nalways been understood to be what it seems to be: an authorization for\nprivate persons to bring suits on behalf o f the Government. Speaking in\nsupport o f the Act when it was adopted, Senator Howard explained that\nit was necessary to deal “speedy and exemplary justice” to “the knave and\nthe rogue” who committed war fraud against “the Government, who is\nthe real sufferer in all cases.” S. Rep. No. 291, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943)\n(quoting 1863 debates). Similarly, the discussions in 1943, when Congress considered eliminating\nthe qui tam action altogether, leave no doubt as to the nature o f a qui tam\naction. Speaking in defense o f the mechanism, Senator Murray, after com­\nplaining about the Department o f Justice’s failure to prosecute antitrust\ncases, said that “if a fraud has been perpetrated ... and the Attorney\n222 General is failing to take advantage o f [evidence of it], any private citizen\nin the United States should be entitled to bring up the case in court.\" 89\nCong. Rec. 7575 (1943) (emphasis added). In a like vein, Senator\nRevercomb asked, “[w]hat harm can be done by saying to the Department\no f Justice, ‘If you do not perform your duty some citizen o f this country is\ngoing to rise and perform it for you?’ ” 89 Cong. Rec. 7598 (1943). The 1986 debates reflect the same understanding. Speaking in the\nHouse, Representative Brooks gave a straightforward explanation o f qui\ntam: “The False Claims Act contains provisions which allow citizens to\nbring suits for false claims on behalf o f the Government.” 132 Cong. Rec.\n22,336 (1986). Representative Bedell described the statute as giving\ninformers “standing to bring suit ... on behalf o f the Government.” 132\nCong. Rec. 22,340 (1986). Senator Grassley, the main force in the Senate\nbehind the 1986 Amendments, explained that the “False Claims Act\nallows an individual knowing o f fraud[] ... to bring suit on behalf o f the\ngovernment....” 131 Cong.

In perhaps the most telling\ndescription, Representative Berman, one o f the bill’s principal drafters,\noffered the following statement: “ [T]his is precisely what this law is\nintended to do: deputize ready and [willing] people ... to bring to justice\nthose contractors who overcharge the government.” 132 Cong. Rec.\n29,322 (1986). Indeed, the Solicitor General appears to concede that the qui tam\ndevice violates the Appointments Clause to the extent a qui tam relator is\nsuing in a representative capacity. Taranto Memo at 8. To surmount this\nconstitutional barrier, the Solicitor General argues that a qui tam action\nis not a suit based on the government’s claim but is really a private suit\nbased on the relator’s private cause o f action for the contingent monetary\naward Congress offered for successfully litigating the suit. The Solicitor\nGeneral thus would argue that, when the relator prosecutes a case, he is\nnot exercising governmental authority, but merely litigating his own pri­\nvate claim. The Solicitor General suggests an analogy to private antitrust\nactions or private title VII actions where both the private party and the\ngovernment can bring substantially identical suits. Id. This argument is untenable because it flatly contradicts the history o f\nqui tam actions, the language and structure o f the False Claims Act, and\nthe Act’s legislative history. All o f these sources make abundantly clear\nthat the relator is suing in a representative capacity to enforce the claim\no f the United States and that his statutory award is not relief for ir\\jury\nsuffered, but a reward for his services. See supra pp. 215, 222-23. In antitrust and title VII actions, the private plaintiff alleges that the\ndefendant’s conduct has invaded his personal legal rights, causing him\ndirect injury. The title VII plaintiff claims that he has been personally\nharmed by discriminatory practices. The antitrust plaintiff claims that he\nhas been economically harmed by a price-fixer’s illegal conduct. Such pri­\nvate plaintiffs have their own independent causes o f action to redress\n223 these invasions o f their rights, which incidentally vindicate the public\ninterest. Under the False Claims Act, however, the government is the only\nparty who has suffered iryury as a result o f the contractor’s alleged fraud. Thus, the relator’s suit under the False Claims Act vindicates the ir\\jury to\nthe government and that iiyury alone. It is clear that the real party in interest represented by the relator is the\ngovernment, because the relator’s suit binds the United States by res judi­\ncata.10 Even when the Attorney General does not participate in the suit,\nany judgment or settlement obtained by the relator has preclusive effect\non the United States. In this respect, qui tam actions differ fundamental­\nly from the private lawsuits cited by the Solicitor General, and indeed\nfrom all “private attorneys general” suits. These private actions do not\nbind the United States because the real plaintiff is the individual suing on\nhis own independent claim."

United\nStates, 366 U.S. 683, 690 (1961) ( “the Government is not bound by private\nantitrust litigation to which it is a stranger”). In a qui tam action, howev­\ner, the relator is not really acting in a private capacity, but rather is stand­\ning in the government’s shoes and is prosecuting the United States’ claim. The Solicitor General’s argument that the relator is merely prosecuting\nhis own private claim ultimately fails because it runs headlong into an\nArticle III standing problem. As discussed below, the relator, especially\nwhen suing only in his personal capacity, has no “case or controversy” to\npresent to the court because he can show no “iryury in fact” as a result of\nthe contractor’s alleged fraud. B. Article I I I Standing Private qui tam actions violate the well-settled doctrine o f Article III\nstanding. The keystone of this modem standing doctrine, which has been\ncarefully refined by the Supreme Court over the past 20 years, is the con­\nstitutional requirement of “iryury in fact.” The Supreme Court has repeat­\nedly held that, at an “irreducible minimum,” Article III requires a plaintiff\nin federal court to demonstrate that:\n(1 )\n(2)\ndant;\n(3) he personally has suffered some actual or threatened iryury;\nthe iryury was caused by the putatively illegal conduct o f the defen­\nand\nthe relief sought likely w ill redress the iryury.

Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99 (1979); Simon v.

Allen v.\nWright, 468 U.S. 737, 754 (1984); Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 482-83. If the\nplaintiff himself has not suffered particularized harm that is “distinct and\npalpable,” Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm, to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208,\n221 (1974), there is no case or controversy under Article III. See, e.g.,\nWorth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975); Sierra Club v.

Under these well-established principles, qui tam suits are plainly\nunconstitutional to the extent they purport to be private actions because\nthe relator has suffered no personal “injury in fact” as a result o f the con­\ntractor’s alleged fraud. The Solicitor General argues that the relator’s prospect o f receiving a\nbounty is enough to satisfy Article III standing requirements. It is clear,\nhowever, that the mere expectation o f a reward cannot be characterized\nunder established Supreme Court precedent as an “ir\\jury” o f any kind. 11 The only party who suffers iryury as a result o f the contractor’s false\nclaims is the government."

The relator simply seeks to stand in the gov­\nernment’s shoes to sue for an invasion o f the government’s rights. The\nmonetary payment he seeks is not judicial relief to redress his iryury, but\na reward for bringing the case. Mere financial incentive to bring the suit\ndoes not satisfy the constitutional standard. The Supreme Court has expressly rejected this argument in Diamond\nv. Charles, 476 U.S. 54 (1986). There, a physician argued that he had\nstanding to continue defending an abortion statute because the trial court\nhad already awarded attorneys’ fees against him. Only he was left to\ndefend the statute, and only by vindicating the statute could he avoid pay­\ning the fees. Although the Court recognized that the physician had a\nfinancial stake in the outcome o f the litigation, it held that financial inter­\nest alone is not sufficient to confer standing. Id. at 69-70. Citing Valley Forge to stress that the plaintiff’s iryury must be a “result o f the putatively illegal conduct,” the Court stated that “Art. Ill standing requires an\niryury with a nexus to the substantive character” o f the underlying claim;\nan interest that is merely “a byproduct o f the suit” is not sufficient. Id. at\n70-71.

The monetary recovery must be directed at redressing an injury suf­\nfered by the plaintiff as the result o f the invasion o f a substantive legal\nright. As the Assistant to the Solicitor General observes, Diamond v.\nCharles is consistent with:\ncase or controversy law generally [which] requires that\nthere be a legal dispute — and that the plaintiff have a claim\no f legal right and the defendant an alleged legal duty to the\nplaintiff — that precedes and is independent o f the lawsuit\nitself. Taranto Memo at 4. Nor does the fact that Congress has specifically authorized uniryured\npersons to bring qui tam actions in any way cure the Article III deficien­\ncy. Congress is bound by Article Ill’s “case or controversy” restriction on\njudicial power and cannot abolish the constitutional requirement o f\n“injury in fact.” Congress cannot confer standing on persons who fail to\nmeet that test. Congress can, o f course, enact statutes creating new substantive legal\nrights, the invasion o f which can give rise to the kind o f particularized\ninjury necessary to create standing. See Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410\nU.S. 614, 617 n.3 (1973). In no event, however, “may Congress abrogate\nthe Art. Ill minima: plaintiff must always have suffered ‘a distinct and pal­\npable iryury to himself... that is likely to be redressed if the requested\nrelief is granted.” Gladstone, Realtors v. Village o f Bellwood, 441 U.S. at\n100. In enacting the qui tam provisions o f the False Claims Act, however,\nCongress has not created any substantive legal right for qui tam plaintiffs\nthe invasion o f which creates Article III iryury. Those qui tam provisions\nsimply permit the relator to sue on behalf o f the United States, whose\nsubstantive rights have been genuinely invaded. As the words o f the\nstatute make clear, a qui tam suit is an action brought to recover “dam­\nages which the Government sustains because o f the [contractor’s fraud­\nulent] act.” 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a) (emphasis added). Qui tam suits thus differ fundamentally from “private attorneys gener­\nal” suits or citizens’ suit provisions in other statutes. The Supreme Court\nhas strictly adhered to the “injury in fact” requirement in interpreting\nthose statutes, holding that only those who can demonstrate their own\npersonal iryury from the claimed illegal conduct are allowed standing to\nsue to protect the public interest in coryunction with their own. See. e.g.,\nMiddlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. National Sea Clammers A ss’n, 453\nU.S. 1, 16 (1981); Sierra Club v.

It is in [this] sense that we have used the phrase ‘private\nattorney general.’”). Qui tam suits also differ from those cases in which\nthe Supreme Court has permitted litigants to raise the rights o f others\nunder so-called jus tertii or “third party” standing. In those cases, the\nCourt has strictly adhered to the “iryury in fact” requirement, allowing a\nplaintiff to assert the rights o f third parties only if the plaintiff showed\nthat the challenged action also iryured him. See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S.\n190, 192-97 (1976); Charles A. Wright, TheLaiv of Federal Courts 72 (4th\ned. 1983). Significantly, the Solicitor General’s own office cannot agree on\nwhether the mere prospect o f a bounty is sufficient to create standing. The Deputy Solicitor “counsel [s] against” making such an argument\nbecause: (1) “it cannot be reconciled with recent Supreme Court deci­\nsions”; (2) it cannot “account for the requirement o f redressability which\nthe Court has stressed in recent decisions”; and (3) it “would be in some\ntension with our usual posture [in standing cases], which has generally\nbeen to insist on a formalistic, corrective-justice type model o f standing.” Memorandum for the Acting Solicitor General, from Thomas Merrill,\nDeputy Solicitor General at 3 (Apr. 5, 1989). The Assistant to the Solicitor\nGeneral admits that the standing issue is “close” and “the hardest ques­\ntion” and that the bounty theory “stands in uneasy relation to prevailing\nprinciples o f standing.” Taranto Memo at 3 n.l. To surmount qui tarn’s obvious conflict with established standing doc­\ntrine, the Solicitor General proposes to argue that qui tam actions must\nbe recognized as “cases or controversies” within the meaning of Article\nIII because they were known in England prior to the Revolution and seem\nto have been used to a limited degree in the early years o f the Republic. This historical argument is fundamentally flawed in several respects. 12\nFirst, the status o f historical qui tam actions as cases or controver­\nsies is irrelevant to the validity o f the Solicitor General’s proposed\nreformulation o f qui tam as a truly private suit by the Telator. Qui tam\nas it existed at the time o f the framing involved actions in which the\nrelator sued in a representative capacity to enforce a public penalty on\nbehalf o f the government. See, e.g., Act o f Mar. 1, 1790, ch. 2, § 3, 1 Stat.\nat 102 (authorizing informers to collect penalties for official miscon­\nduct under Census Act). Although it may have violated separation o f\npowers, such an action at least presented a case or controversy\nbecause the real party in interest — the government — had suffered an\ninjury and thus had a cognizable claim."

But it is mere sleight-of-hand to\nsuggest that if qui tam in this sense was necessarily a case or contro­\nversy, so is qui tam in the very different sense proposed by the Solicitor 12 This histoneal argument concerns the status o f qui tam actions as cases or controversies We discuss\nbelow, see infra, at pp. 232-38, the broader claim that history validates qui tam whether or not it can be\naccommodated to any particular constitutional principle, such as the requirements o f Article III 227 General, in which a relator w ho has not been injured sues for himself,\nnot the government. Next, it is far from clear that the Framers, had they examined the mat­\nter, would have concluded that qui tam as they knew it satisfied the case\nor controversy requirement. There is certainly no direct evidence that\nthey thought so. Indeed, qui tam statutes that permitted an uninjured\ninformer to sue, and actions brought by such informers, apparently were\nboth fairly rare. Many statutes seem to have contemplated — and almost\nall suits actually brought seem to have been — actions either by public\nofficials or injured parties. 13 Qui tam actions brought by pure informers\nthus probably would not have seemed a commonplace thing for the\nFramers, and we cannot assume that they would have thought that\nArticle III had to bend to such actions. Finally, the argument that anything that could go into court in 1787\nmust be a case or controversy has unacceptable consequences. At com­\nmon law, the writs o f prohibition, certiorari, quo warranto, and man­\ndamus all were available to “strangers” who had no personal interest or\niryury in fact. See, e.g., Raoul Berger, Standing to Sue in Public Actions:\nIs it a Constitutional Requirement? 78 Yale L.J. 816, 819-25 (1969); Louis\nL. Jaffe, Standing to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74 Harv. L.\nRev. 1265, 1269-71 (1961). But both mandamus and quo warranto are\nactions brought to challenge the conduct o f government officials. Under\nthe Solicitor General’s regime, any person could use these writs to chal­\nlenge or compel government action wholly unrelated to the person using\nthe writ. The implications o f this position are staggering. In any event, the Solicitor General’s historical argument proves too\nmuch. If this view were accepted, it would mean that Congress could cre­\nate universal standing simply by attaching a penalty to the violation o f\nany law and offering any person who sues a right to share in the pro­\nceeds. This would privatize the Executive power, allowing any private\nperson to enforce the law against any other, while opening up the deci­\nsions by the Executive to unprecedented interference. For example,\nCongress could enforce its restrictions on the President’s conduct o f for­\neign policy (such as the Boland Amendment) through qui tam actions."

The qui tam provisions infringe on both. First, the\nprovisions permit a private citizen to sue on behalf o f the government,\neven though the Attorney General may have decided for legitimate rea­\nsons not to prosecute the claim. This power removes from the executive\nbranch the prosecutorial discretion that is at the heart o f the President’s\npower to execute the laws. Second, the qui tam provisions vest in the\nrelator a voice in crucial litigation decisions, even if the Attorney General\ndecides to enter the suit. The Attorney General may not move to dismiss\nthe suit, settle the action, or restrict the relator’s participation except by\npermission o f the court. See 31 U.S.C. § 3730(c). The court also decides\nwhether discovery may be stayed to prevent interference with ongoing\ncivil or criminal investigations. Id. These provisions vest core executive\npower in the judicial branch. Moreover, in suits in which the Attorney\nGeneral declines to participate, the relator exercises full sway over the\ncourse of the government’s litigation interests. The Attorney General can\nneither remove the relator from his “office” nor instruct him how to rep­\nresent the government’s interests. This transfer by Congress o f executive power away from the President\nto the relator and the court is impermissible even under the Supreme\nCourt’s most lenient standard forjudging threats to separation o f powers. In Morrison v. Olson, the Court held that restrictions on the Executive’s\npower to supervise and remove an independent counsel did not violate\nseparation o f powers principles, but only because the Attorney General\nretained “sufficient control over the independent counsel to ensure that\nthe President is able to perform his constitutionally assigned duties.” 487\nU.S. at 696.

First, the Attorney General\nhas control over initiation o f prosecutions because he retains the “unreviewable discretion” to decline to request the appointment o f an inde­\npendent counsel. See id. at 695-96. Second, the Attorney General controls\nthe breadth o f the independent counsel’s investigation because it is he\nwho provides the statement o f facts upon which the special court sets the\ncounsel’s jurisdiction. Third, the Attorney General retains the power to\nremove the independent counsel for “good cause” and thus has “ample\nauthority” to ensure that the counsel is properly fulfilling his duties. Id.\nat 696. Fourth, the Act expressly requires that, once appointed, the inde­\npendent counsel must comply with Justice Department policy unless it\nwould be impossible to do so. See id. The Court’s analysis in Morrison highlights the unconstitutionality o f\nthe qui tam provisions. In contrast to the independent counsel statute,\nunder the qui tam provisions the Attorney General loses all control over\nthe decision whether to initiate a suit. Even where the Attorney General\ndetermines that initiating a suit is not warranted, the qui tam relator is\n229 empowered to override his judgment and initiate the fraud action. When\nthe Attorney General concludes that proceeding with a suit is not merited\nor otherwise not in the United States’ interests, the fraud action neverthe­\nless goes forward in the government’s name, under the complete control\no f the self-interested relator. The Attorney General has no control over the\nbreadth o f the suit. He has no pow er to remove the relator no matter how\nirresponsible his suit becomes. He has no power to require the relator to\nadhere to the rules and policies o f the Department o f Justice, despite the\nfact that the relator is suing in the name o f the United States. 14\nFurther, if the Attorney General does not enter the suit within the first\nsixty days, his ability later to assert the interests o f the United States are\nsharply curtailed. He cannot intervene unless he persuades the court that\n“good cause” exists. Even then, the private relator still has “the right to\nconduct the action,” and the court may not “limit[] [his] status and\nrights.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(c)(3). Moreover, even where the Attorney\nGeneral does enter the case during the first sixty days, he does not have\nthe right to take over the litigation. The relator remains a full party enti­\ntled to participate in the case. Through his own conduct o f the case, the\nrelator effectively can overrule litigation decisions made by the Attorney\nGeneral, and he is specifically empowered to challenge any effort by the\ngovernment to settle or dismiss the suit. When a dispute arises between\nthe Attorney General and the relator, the ultimate decision is left to the\ndiscretion o f the court. There is another fundamental difference between the qui tam provisions\nand the independent counsel statute."

There is another fundamental difference between the qui tam provisions\nand the independent counsel statute. The independent counsel device was\nintended to address a narrow“structural problem — the perceived conflict\no f interest when the Attorney General is called upon to investigate crimi­\nnal wrongdoing by his close colleagues within the executive branch. The\nCourt accepted the independent counsel device as an appropriate means o f\ndealing with this intrabranch conflict. The device arguably does not undu­\nly encroach on executive power because its very purpose is to investigate\nimpermissible executive activity. Moreover, the device is narrowly tailored\nto achieve its purpose; it encroaches on the Executive only to the limited\nextent necessary to protect against a conflict o f interest, while retaining\nexecutive control consistent with that objective. Both the premise o f the qui tam provisions and the means Congress has\nused to advance its goals are far more threatening to the executive\nbranch. The legislative history o f the 1986 Amendments shows that\nCongress was acting out o f generalized distrust of, and dissatisfaction\nwith, the way the executive branch was carrying out its law enforcement\nresponsibilities. Senator Grassley felt that “the Government bureaucracy\n[was] ... unwilling to guard against or aggressively punish fraud.” 131\nCong. Rec. 22,322 (1985). Representative Berman was equally candid:\n14 See the general discussion o f the statute’s provisions, supra pp. 215-17. 230 he supported qui tam because he thought that “the Department o f Justice\nhas not done an acceptable job o f prosecuting defense contractor fraud.” 132 Cong. Rec. 22,339 (1986). Later in the debate, he explained that the\nrelator was being given full party status at trial “to keep pressure on the\nGovernment to pursue the case in a diligent fashion.” 132 Cong. Rec.\n29,322 (1986).15 The history o f qui tam thus confirms that it is not a narrowly focused\nmeasure designed to cure a structural defect within the executive branch. Rather, Congress is simply attempting to substitute its judgment on how\nto execute the laws for that o f the President. More narrowly tailored\nmeans are available to fulfill the legitimate purpose o f enhancing enforce­\nment o f procurement fraud cases. Congress could provide greater\nresources and, to the extent it wanted to encourage informers, could pro­\nvide for simple bounties for their information without giving them the\nauthority to conduct the litigation. In contrast, permitting Congress to choose its own private law\nenforcers violates separation o f powers and establishes a basis for gov­\nernance by tyranny. As Madison recognized, the legislative branch is the\nmost powerful, and hence, potentially the most dangerous to the separa­\ntion o f powers, because\nit can with the greater facility, mask under complicated and\nindirect measures, the encroachments which it makes on\nthe co-ordinate departments. It is not unfrequently a ques­\ntion o f real-nicety in legislative bodies, whether the opera­\ntion o f a particular measure, will, or will not extend beyond\nthe legislative sphere.

The statute enables a private party with\nonly a mercenary interest in a case to force a suit to be brought, even\nthough the Attorney General already may have decided for legitimate pol­\nicy reasons not to prosecute. The Supreme Court has recognized that the\nExecutive has the exclusive authority to decide whether to prosecute a\ncase, United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693 (1974), because only a uni­\ntary executive properly can balance the competing interests at stake,\nincluding law enforcement, foreign affairs, national security, and the\noverriding interest in just administration o f the laws. IV. HISTORY DOES NOT VALIDATE QUI TAM In the face o f qui tarn’s admittedly “grave dangers” to the President, the\nSolicitor General is prepared to disregard settled constitutional doctrine and\ndecades o f clear Supreme Court decisions in order to uphold the facial valid­\nity o f qui tam. He claims this fateful step is compelled by qui tarn’s historical\nusage. 16In fact, the historical argument is subject to decisive objections. To begin with, the entire historical inquiry is essentially pointless, since\nthe version o f qui tam that the Solicitor General proposes to defend dif­\nfers essentially from qui tam as it existed in history. Whatever else may\nhave been true o f it, historical qui tam was a proceeding in which the rela­\ntor sued on behalf o f the government, and once the suit was brought,\nthere was no provision for government intervention."

The Solicitor\nGeneral recognizes that this violates the Appointments Clause and would\nsubstitute for it a new regime under which the relator sues on his own\nbehalf and the government is entitled to enter the case. History does not\ncontain that regime, and therefore cannot be invoked to support it. Moreover, the historical argument fails on its own terms. We agree with\nthe Solicitor General that certain kinds o f constitutional questions will be\ninfluenced by certain kinds o f historical practices. But an examination o f\nthe Supreme Court’s use of history demonstrates, not that history invari­\nably prevails, but that close questions where the application o f principle\nis unclear can be resolved by thoroughly considered, lonq-standing his­\ntorical practices that can be reconciled with doctrine. The constitution­ ality o f qui tam, however, is not a close question, and the use o f qui tam,\nfar from being ingrained in our legal institutions, has been marginal at\nmost. History cannot save qui tam. First, usage alone — regardless how longstanding and venerable —\ncannot validate a practice that clearly violates constitutional principles. 17\nIG That usage, which w e discuss more fu lly below, consists o f the existence o f qui tam in England and\nthe enactm ent by early Congresses o f a fe w qui tam provisions\n17 See, e.g., Walz v Tax C o m m ’n , 397 U.S. 664,678 (1970) ( “It is obviously correct that no one acquires\na vested o r protected right in violation o f the Constitution by long use, even when that span o f time cov­\ners our entire national existence and indeed predates it.\"). 232 The Constitution, not history, is the supreme law. The Court repeatedly\nhas stated that “ [standing alone, historical [practice] cannot justify con­\ntemporary [constitutional] violations,” Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. at\n790, even when the practice “covers our entire national existence and\nindeed predates it.” Walz v. Tax Com m ’n, 397 U.S. at 678. Qui tam is fundamentally irreconcilable with the doctrine o f standing\nunder Article III and the President’s appointment powers and law\nenforcement functions under Article II. This is a case where, absent the\ninvocation o f history, there would be no question about the practice’s\nunconstitutionality. The mere fact that the earliest congresses adopted a\npractice has never been enough to establish conclusively the practice’s\nconstitutionality. Indeed, Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137\n(1803), struck down part o f the Judiciary Act o f 1789, a statute adopted\nby the First Congress. There are other examples o f actions taken by the\nFirst Congress that later became viewed as unconstitutional. See, e.g.,\nWallace v.

See, e.g., Young v. United States ex ref.\nVuitton et Fils S.A.; Marsh v. Chambers; Walz v. Tax Com m ’n. Even if\nthe constitutionality o f qui tam were a close question, however, the\nstatute could not satisfy these three factors. As to the first factor, the Court noted in Marsh v. Chambers that the\nweight to be accorded the actions o f the First Congress depends on the\nextent to which the members actually reflected upon how the provisions\no f the new Constitution applied to the actions they were taking."

Early qui tam statutes have all the hallmarks o f action “thoughtlessly”\ntaken. As far as we are aware, the historical record shows no evidence\nthat qui tarn’s constitutional implications were discussed or considered. On the contrary, because o f the unique historical contexts in which qui\ntam statutes were adopted, the device’s incompatibility with executive\nlaw enforcement functions would not have been immediately apparent. Qui tam simply did not bite hard enough for the Executive to recognize\nor resist it as a usurpation o f its authority. Moreover, we know that mem­\nbers o f the First Congress held erroneous assumptions about the extent\nto which, under the Constitution, English common law and its institu­\ntions had been carried over to the federal level of the United States. 19The\nFirst Congress’s early use o f qui tam appears to have been nothing more\nthan a manifestation of this initial confusion. As to the second factor, the Court has relied on history to resolve bor­\nderline cases when the practice has been so pervasive as to become “part\no f the fabric o f our society.” Id. at 792. A brief survey o f the history o f qui\ntam demonstrates that it is a marginal practice that could be eliminated\nwithout leaving a trace. 19 For the first six years after the Constitution was adopted, virtually all persons who considered the issue believed that the Constitution permitted a federal comm on law o f crimes. See Stewart Jay, O i'igin s\no f Federal C o m m o n L a w P a ri One , 133 U Pa L Rev 1003 (1985). The Framers presumably believed\nthis because it was a practice with which they w ere familiar at common law in Britain and in the states. Th e federal com m on law o f cnmes w as challenged only after a political dispute arose between the\nFederalist and Republican parties, which led the Republicans to begin to appreciate that the federal com ­\nmon law o f crimes was inconsistent w ith the new Constitution’s vesting o f the legislative power solely in\nCongress Thom as Jefferson, who had approved a comm on law prosecution, became a vigorous advo­\ncate o f the view that such prosecutions w ere unconstitutional Today, this is the conventional view o f the\nmatter."

Both o f those exclusive vestings o f pow er w ere innovations introduced\nby the Constitution, the full implications o f which were only slowly perceived 234 In name, qui tam originated at common law, but common law qui tam\n— which disappeared as early as the 14th century — required injury in\nfact. See Washington University Note, at 83-86. An aggrieved party sought\nto gain access to royal courts by arguing that the private ii\\jury he had\nsustained also was an affront to the king. By the end o f the 14th century,\nthe royal courts were hearing suits without the fiction of qui tam, and the\ndevice faded. See id. at 85. Common law qui tam thus supports the\nSolicitor General’s position only if turned on its head: at common law, the\nactual iryury was to the plaintiff, and it was a legal fiction that iryury was\nalso done the king; under the False Claims Act, the real iryury is to the\ngovernment, and the Solicitor General urges upon us the fiction that it is\nthe private plaintiff who has a viable cause o f action. After the 14th century, qui tam became a creature o f statute, under\nwhich injury in fact was often required. See Washington University\nNote, at 86. Some statutes, however, permitted private informers,\nregardless o f iryury, to prosecute a wrongdoer for violation o f a penal\nlaw. Although the statutes o f Parliament have only tangential bearing on\nthe validity o f a practice under our new Constitution, it nevertheless is\nnoteworthy that even in England, qui tam proved a vexatious device\nthat ultimately could not be reconciled with the institutions o f free and\nresponsible government. As in the early days o f our Republic, statutory\nqui tam served a necessary expedient for a medieval English Gov­\nernment that did not yet have the machinery for effective local law\nenforcement. Part o f the decline o f qui tam may be attributed to its history o f abuse. One commentator noted that the device was used “as means to gratify ill\nwill. Litigation was stirred up simply in order that the informer might\ncompound for a sum o f money. Threats to sue were an easy means o f\nlevying blackmail.” 4 Holdsworth, A History of English Law 356 (1924). Lord Coke classed informers as “viperous vermin.” He contended that\n“the king cannot commit the sword o f his justice or the oil o f his mercy\nconcerning any penal statute to any subject.” See Gerald Hurst, “ Common\nInformers ,” 147 Contemp. Rev. 189-90 (1935). From the 16th century for­\nward, the history o f qui tam is one o f retreat, as Parliament progressive­\nly restricted and curtailed its use. It ultimately was abolished there in\n1951. See Washington University Note, at 83-88. On this side o f the Atlantic, qui tam never really gained a secure\nfoothold, particularly at the federal level."

On this side o f the Atlantic, qui tam never really gained a secure\nfoothold, particularly at the federal level. It appears that six qui tam\nstatutes, restricted to narrow enforcement areas, were enacted during\nthe first four congresses. Adopted when the Executive was embryonic,\nthese statutes were essentially stop-gap measures, confined to narrow\ncircumstances where the Executive lacked the resources to enforce the\nlaw. Their intent was to assist a fledgling Executive, not supplant it. As\nthe Executive’s law enforcement capabilities gathered strength, qui tam\nrapidly fell into disfavor. Within a decade, “the tide had ... tum[ed]\n235 against” qui tam, and Congress started curtailing its use. Leonard D.\nWhite, The Federalists 417 (1956). The only other appreciable use o f qui tam came during the Nation’s\ngreatest emergency, the Civil War. The unprecedented explosion in fed­\neral procurement, coupled with the extreme demands o f war, prompted\nenactment o f the False Claims Act. Following the war, qui tam again\nbecame dormant. By 1986, except for a flurry o f activity during World\nWar II, qui tam had become an anachronism. 20 We think a fair survey o f\nthe history o f qui tam in the United States reveals it as, at best, a mar­\nginal and transitory device that never achieved prominence within our\nconstitutional system because it was so fundamentally incompatible\nwith that system. Nor does the practice of qui tam meet the third criterion, under which\nthe Court may uphold a practice that can be accommodated as a narrow\nand self-contained exception that does not threaten to undermine impor­\ntant constitutional principles. See e.g., Young v. ref. Vuitton et Fils S. A.. But qui tam is not capable o f being contained as a narrow exception,\nrestricted in a principled manner to its limited historic scope.21 Qui tarn’s\nprinciple o f private law enforcement is so fundamentally incompatible\nwith the established doctrines o f standing and separation o f powers that\nif qui tam were accepted, these doctrines would be drained o f any mean­\ning. Qui tam is, by its nature, an exception that will consume the rule. Qui tam thus does not have any o f the characteristics that have led the\nSupreme Court to give an historical practice the benefit o f the doubt in a\nclose case. Moreover, there are two considerations specific to qui tam that\nreduce the authority of its historical pedigree. First, where separation of\npowers issues are at stake, w e do not think it is appropriate to give prior\ncongressional action dispositive weight in determining the constitutional­\n20 For example, w e are aware o f only on e case in this century under the qui tam provisions that apply\nto the Indian trade, and that was brought by a relator who had been personally injured.

Similarly, w e are aware\no f only one 20th century action brought under the qui tam provision o f the postal laws, which nominal­\nly remained in fo rce until the creation o f the Postal Service in 1970. In that case, the Eighth Circuit held\nthat the statute did not provide a private right o f action fo r the informer. Williams v. WeUs Fargo & Co\nExpress, 177 F 352 (8th Cir. 1910). However, passage o f the 1986 Amendments significantly increased awards and subsequently has resulted in a substantial increase in the number o f qui tam suits. 21 I f w e find that the historical practice o f qui tam is per se constitutional because o f its pedigree, then\nw e must accept the entire practice as it actually existed, not merely those aspects o f it that seem least\nobjectionable to m odem sensibilities. Th is would raise the possibility o f cnminal prosecutions by private\npersons, especially given that in England cnminal qui tam was w ell known. See Washington University\nN ote, at 87-89 In the United States, the penalty provision o f the first Census Act, which authorized qui\ntam enforcem ent, allowed the penalty to b e collected through an action in debt or by indictment or infor­\nmation — the latter tw o implying a cnminal proceeding. A ct o f Mar. 1, 1790, ch. 2, § 3, 1 Stat. 101, 102. Moreover, some o f the early qui tam statutes, including the first Census Act, authonzed private persons\nw h o had not been ii\\jured to sue public officials in qui tam to collect penalties for the officials’ failure to\nperform their duty.

But if w e conclude that w e cannot accept some part o f the\nhistoncal practice, there is no reason to defend the remainder under the theory that history is necessar­\nily correct 236 ity o f a later statute. Congress’s aggrandizing enactments should not serve\nas conclusive precedent on the scope o f Congress’s own authority. The\nFramers recognized that, in a mixed government, it is the legislative body\n— the “impetuous vortex” — that is the branch most disposed to usurp the\npowers o f the others. They also warned that “ [the legislative department]\ncan with the greater facility, mask under complicated and indirect mea­\nsures, the encroachments which it makes on the coordinate departments.” The Federalist No. 48, at 334 (James Madison) (Jacob E. Cooke ed. 1961). It is true that many o f the members o f the early congresses had been\ninvolved in framing the Constitution. We cannot assume for that reason,\nhowever, that as congressmen they were above attempted encroachments\non the other branches. Their actions are not sacrosanct and should be sub­\nject to careful examination for “masked” encroachments on co-ordinate\nbranches."

Our obligation to the Constitution requires that we adhere to\nthe principles the Framers wrote into that document, not to the Framers’\nmisapplications o f those principles. 22\nLongstanding congressional practice gains somewhat more preceden­\ntial value where accompanied by equally longstanding ratification by one\nor both o f the other branches. But ratification requires more than\nunthinking acquiescence — it requires an informed and deliberate judg­\nment that a particular practice is constitutional. Early Executive acquies­\ncence to qui tam is easily explained. As suggested above, because o f the\nunique historical context in which qui tam was adopted, its incompatibil­\nity with our constitutional framework was not immediately evident. An\nexpedient measure — even one undergirded by a noxious principle —\nmay, in a particular historical setting, appear benign and at first be w el­\ncomed without question because of its apparent functionality. It is only\nthrough experience, as the measure is applied through a range o f cir­\ncumstances, that the pernicious principle reveals itself and becomes fully\nunderstood. There is no doubt that the First Congress resorted, sparing­\nly, to the expedient measure o f qui tam. But we doubt the Framers or the\nFirst President would have embraced the underlying principle had they\nconsidered and fully understood its implications. 22 Genuine separation o f powers, with three truly distinct and independent branches o f government\nunder a written constitution, was very new in 1789. It is therefore not surprising that early congresses\nenacted a number o f measures that would today stnke us as plainly unconstitutional. For example, the\ncourts w ere given a number o f non-judicial powers and duties, including the removaJ o f U.S Marshals,\nwho then as now w ere appointed by the President. A ct o f Sept. 24, 1789, ch 20, § 27, 1 Stat 72, 87 The\nFirst Congress also directed federal judges to substitute fo r French consuls in investigating shipwrecks\no f French vessels, A ct o f A pr 14,1792, ch. 24, § 1,1 Stat. 254, and to make reports to the Secretary o f the\nTreasury on customs forfeitures, Act o f May 26, 1790, ch 12, 1 Stat. at 122-23. See generally Russell\nWheeler, E x tm ju d ic ia l A ctivities o f the Early Suprem e Court, 1973 Sup. Ct. Rev 123. Moreover, early\ncongresses follow ed the colonial practice o f treating the Secretary o f the Treasury as if he w ere as much\ntheir officer as the President’s, requiring that he prepare reports at the request o f either House. A c t o f\nSept 2, 1789, ch. 12, § 2, 1 Stat 65-66. This provision survives as 31 U S.C. § 331(d), which appears to be\na clear violation o f IN S v.

Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983) 237 Second, we think a strong case can be made that Morrison v. Olson\nsharply undercuts any historical argument for qui tam. Morrison judges\na practice’s constitutionality by the degree to which the practice actually\ninterferes with the Executive’s functions. See 487 U.S. at 685-97. Under\nthis balancing test, the early qui tam statutes arguably may have passed\nconstitutional muster, while Congress’s 1986 use o f qui tam clearly does\nnot. Early qui tam statutes involved little or no actual interference with\nthe Executive. For practical purposes, they were confined to circum­\nstances where the Executive’s capacity to enforce the law was virtually\nnon-existent — either because, as in the case o f the 18th century statutes,\nthe Executive was embryonic, or, as in the case o f the Civil War statute,\nthe Executive was overwhelmed and otherwise occupied. Those statutes\nwere designed to aid, not supplant, the Executive. They reflect no ambi­\ntion to control or override the Executive’s official law enforcement activ­\nities. Prompted by necessity, they fell into disuse once necessity abated. In contrast, the 1986 Amendments substantially interfere with the\nExecutive’s functions. The executive branch today is fully capable o f\npolicing claims against the government. 23 Indeed, procurement is now\none o f the most heavily regulated and policed sectors o f public activity. In resuscitating the dormant qui tam device, Congress’s express purpose\nwas to interfere with the Executive’s law enforcement activities, to\ndisplace official prosecutorial discretion with the mercenary motives o f\nprivate bounty hunters. The narrow use o f qui tam in the 18th century\ncannot validate the kind of encroachment qui tam causes today. V. THE SOLICITOR GENERAL’S UNWISE STRATEGY The Solicitor General's approach declines to face squarely the consti­\ntutional questions raised by the qui tam statute. Rather, it adopts the tac­\ntic o f arguing that the statute is facially constitutional and constitutional\nas it has been applied so far, but reserving the right to argue a violation\no f separation o f powers based on a balancing o f interests if additional\nencroachment on the Executive’s powers subsequently occurs. This\napproach employs both bad tactics and bad law. First, the approach is tactically unwise because it forces us to forfeit\nthe strongest objective arguments in favor o f protecting executive branch\ninterests. The Solicitor General advocates total relinquishment o f the\nstanding and Appointments Clause arguments; yet, as discussed above,\nunder existing case law these arguments point clearly toward a conclu­\nsion that the statute is unconstitutional. Once those are abandoned, all\nthat will remain to protect the President’s interests will be the argument 23 Even assuming the Executive lacks sufficient resources to investigate and prosecute such claims, there are other ways Congress can address the problem that would be constitutional, such as funding\nmore Department o f Justice resources targeted at those claims. 238 that at some undefined point, the subjective degree o f encroachment on\nexecutive powers will have become unbearable. That sort o f unprincipled\nbalancing approach leaves the Executive entirely vulnerable to an\nadverse judicial decision."

That sort o f unprincipled\nbalancing approach leaves the Executive entirely vulnerable to an\nadverse judicial decision. Moreover, conceding standing itself weakens the separation of powers\nargument. To satisfy the standing requirements, we must accept the fic­\ntion that the relator and the Executive are coplaintiffs pursuing two sep­\narate claims. With that fiction in place, the encroachment on executive\npowers is difficult to resist, since the issue becomes framed in terms of\nthe competing interests o f two litigants rather than an infringement on\nseparation o f powers. Second, the approach represents a completely disingenuous way of\ndetermining a statute’s constitutionality. Although it is generally true that\na statute should be construed when possible to avoid constitutional prob­\nlems, portions o f the statute cannot be twisted or ignored to reach that\nresult. The Court recently reaffirmed the longstanding principle that in\nassessing the facial validity o f a statute, it will not ‘“press statutory con­\nstruction “to the point o f disingenuous evasion” even to avoid a constitu­\ntional question.’” Public Citizen v. United States Department of Justice,\n491 U.S. at 467 (quoting United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 96 (1985)\n(quoting Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U.S. 373, 379 (1933))). Accord\nWebster v. Reproductive Health Servs., 492 U.S. 490 (1989) (reprimand­\ning the plurality for “distorting the statute” to avoid invalidating it)\n(Blackmun, J., dissenting). Even the Solicitor General concedes that\nsome provisions of the qui tam statute are facially unconstitutional, such\nas the grant to the court o f the ultimate power to decide whether the gov­\nernment may settle or dismiss a qui tam suit when the relator objects. See\nTaranto Memo at 12. To argue, then, that these provisions must be\nignored for now and later applied other than as written to avoid an asapplied challenge engages in the very sort o f “disingenuous evasion”\nagainst which the Court has cautioned. Moreover, by conceding that the\nstatute is constitutional as applied to date, the Solicitor General concedes\nthe legality o f the prime example o f encroachment on executive powers\n— the Executive’s ability to initiate suit and the discretion to decide\nwhich cases not to pursue. Third, the Solicitor General’s proposed balancing approach does not\nproperly apply Morrison v. Olson. The Solicitor General advocates exam­\nining each case brought under the qui tam statute to ascertain the degree\nof that case’s encroachment on executive powers. This method o f analy­\nsis is completely inconsistent with the balancing approach used in\nMorrison, which looked instead at the potential impact o f applying the\nstatute according to its terms. The Solicitor General also advocates a more global approach to ana­\nlyzing the potential encroachment on executive powers. Under this\napproach, the Solicitor General recommends waiting to see if Congress\n239 employs the qui tam method o f enforcement in other statutory contexts. If so, the Solicitor General postulates that the cumulative burden on\nexecutive powers might be so great that the amendments to the False\nClaims Act then would be unconstitutional. This method o f analysis has\nno basis in law."

Moreover, there is no prin­\ncipled way to determine how many such statutes must be enacted before\nthe encroachment achieves constitutional proportions. Finally, the Solicitor General’s piecemeal approach fundamentally con­\nflicts with his historical argument. The Solicitor General contends in part\nthat qui tam must be upheld because its historical acceptance by courts\nand Congress since this country’s inception has been “ancient, regular,\nand unbroken.” Taranto Memo at 4. In particular, the Solicitor General\nhas pointed to the favorable treatment given an earlier version o f the\nFalse Claims Act qui tam provisions in United States ex rel. Marcus v.\nHess, 317 U.S. 537 (1943). That version o f the Act, however, did not con­\ntain the provisions introduced by the 1986 Amendments granting the\ncourt the ultimate authority to dismiss or settle a qui tam action in which\nthe government has intervened. The Solicitor General acknowledges that\nhis view o f the statute’s constitutionality ultimately depends upon a prop­\ner application o f those provisions. See Taranto Memo at 12.
