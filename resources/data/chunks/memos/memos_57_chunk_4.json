  "chunk_text": "128 There is a line of Comptroller General decisions holding that an\nofficer or employee has on his shoulders “the duty of qualifying himself\nfor the performance of his official duties.” 22 Comp. Gen. 460, 461\n(1942). See also 51 Comp. Gen. 701 (1972) (disallowing the govern­\nment’s payment of bar admission fees) and 31 Comp. Gen. 465 (1952),\n22 Comp. Gen. 243 (1942) (both disallowing government payment for\npre-employment medical examinations). In our view, legal fees incurred\nin connection with the confirmation process are not analogous to these\nother personal costs of job qualification. As discussed earlier, the con­\nfirmation process involves overriding governmental interests of a mag­\nnitude not present in the decisions cited above. In addition, the cited\nComptroller General decisions involve expenditures that benefit the\nemployee in a personal capacity, while the legal services at issue will\nbenefit the employee primarily in an official capacity. For reasons stated above, we conclude that the proposed payment of\nlegal fees by a private foundation would not violate 18 U.S.C §209. T heodore B.
