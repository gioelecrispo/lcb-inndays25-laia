  "chunk_text": "Beyond\nreceiving access to tens of thousands of pages of documents, the Committee also\n“deposed or interviewed eight key officials from the EPA” concerning the\nCalifornia waiver decision, id. at 1, and, as discussed above, the Committee had an 5 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 32 opportunity to explore the California waiver decision with the EPA Administrator\nat the public hearing on May 20. OIRA’s and EPA’s efforts represent an extraordinary attempt to accommodate\nthe Committee’s interest in understanding why EPA denied California’s waiver\npetition, why EPA issued the revised NAAQS for ozone, and the involvement of\nyou and your staff in both decisions. Given the overwhelming amount of material\nand information already provided to the Committee, it is difficult to understand\nhow the subpoenaed information serves any legitimate legislative need. In any\nevent, when I balance the Committee’s attenuated legislative interest in the\nsubpoenaed documents against the Executive Branch’s strong interest in protecting\ntheir confidentiality, I conclude that the Committee has not established that the\nsubpoenaed documents are “demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment”\nof the Committee’s legitimate legislative functions. Senate Select Comm., 498\nF.2d at 731.\nIII. For these reasons, I conclude that you may properly assert executive privilege\nin response to the Committee’s subpoenas. MICHAEL B. MUKASEY\nAttorney General 6"
