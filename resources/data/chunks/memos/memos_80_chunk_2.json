  "chunk_text": "In the quoted passage, Justice\nO’Connor explained why the Court declined to find a violation of the Establishment Clause in Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind, 474\nU.S. 481 (1986) (holding plaintiff could use vocational training grant to become a\nminister), and Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983) (upholding state tax deduction for educational expenses such as parochial school tuition). Indeed, because\nindirect aid to an FBO is “akin to the government issuing a paycheck to an\nemployee who, in turn, donates a portion of that check to a religious institution,”\nMitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. at 841, such aid is permissible under the Establishment Clause and need not be segregated into a separate account. 4\nSHELDON BRADSHAW\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel 4 The Child Care and Development Block Grant Program of 1990, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 9858-9858q\n(1994), for example, has been providing low-income parents indirect aid for child care via “certificates” redeemable at, inter alia, churches and other FBOs. The Act has never been so much as even\nchallenged in the courts as unconstitutional. 128 227-329 VOL_25_PROOF.pdf 138 10/22/12 11:10 AM"
