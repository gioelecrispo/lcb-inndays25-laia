  "chunk_text": "See\nStaples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 622 n.3 (1994) (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (“The mens rea presumption requires knowledge only of the facts that make the\ndefendant’s conduct illegal, lest it conflict with the related presumption, deeply\nrooted in the American legal system, that, ordinarily, ignorance of the law or a\nmistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution.”) (quotations and citations\nomitted). Finally, the concern expressed in Liparota about criminalizing a broad\nswath of seemingly innocent conduct is less present here. The statute in Liparota\ncriminalized the unauthorized use of food stamps by any participant in the\nprogram, as well as by any person who might come in possession of these stamps. 471 U.S. at 426–27. In contrast, section 1320d-6, as we conclude above, applies\ndirectly to covered entities. These covered entities—health plans, health care\nclearinghouses, certain health care providers, and Medicare prescription drug card\nsponsors—are likely well aware that the health care business they conduct is\nheavily regulated by HIPAA and other laws. To the extent that some concern\nremains, it is insufficient to override the plain meaning of the statute. Accordingly,\nLiparota provides no support for giving “knowingly” in section 1320d-6 a\nmeaning different from its usual understanding as referring only to knowledge of\nthe facts that constitute the offense. III. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that covered entities and those persons\nrendered accountable by general principles of corporate criminal liability may be\nprosecuted directly under 42 U.S.C. § 1320d-6 and that the “knowingly” element\nof the offense set forth in that provision requires only proof of knowledge of the\nfacts that constitute the offense.
