  "chunk_text": "The NIDA contract is a longstanding feature of the marijuana licensing\nscheme, and the current version of that contract is annually renewable\nthrough March 2020. 2015 NIDA Contract at 27. Although DEA must\ndischarge the obligations required by Article 23(2), NIDA may still play a\nsignificant role. The relevant statutes require that “[r]egistration applications by practitioners wishing to conduct research with controlled substances in schedule I shall be referred to the Secretary [of Health and\nHuman Services], who shall determine the qualifications and competency\nof each practitioner requesting registration, as well as the merits of the\nresearch protocol.” 21 U.S.C. § 823(f ). The Single Convention does not\nrequire that a single government agency be charged with all responsibilities related to marijuana, and the congressional decision to delegate those\nresponsibilities to HHS is consistent with the Single Convention. Aside\nfrom carrying out its role under section 823(f ), NIDA may continue to\nexercise some supervision over certain aspects of the marijuana cultivation, and DEA may consult NIDA in the process. We see no reason why\nthe NIDA contract framework might not remain in place under a system\nin which DEA assumes clear title to the marijuana, either at inception or\nby purchase after harvest, and then takes physical possession after harvest. For instance, DEA could station one or more employees at the National Center after cultivation as a way of ensuring physical possession of\nthe marijuana and exclusive control over its distribution. We would be pleased to advise on these or any other matters concerning implementation of a new licensing framework. HENRY C. WHITAKER\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel\n25"
