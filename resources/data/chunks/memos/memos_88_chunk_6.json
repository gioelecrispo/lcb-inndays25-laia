  "chunk_text": "A “ claim ” is defined to include a written request for payment “ for com­\npensation for damages,” id. §2701(3), and, in turn, a “ ‘claimant’ means any\nperson or government who presents a claim for compensation” under the Act,\nid. §2701(4) (emphasis added). 7 Finally, the term “ damages” is defined to\ninclude damages to “ natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing\nthe damage, which shall be recoverable by a United States trustee, a State trustee,\nan Indian tribe trustee, o r a foreign trustee.” Id. §§2701(5), 2702(b)(2)(A)\n(emphasis added). Congress expressly authorized a claimant under section 1013 to present a claim\nto the Fund in three separate provisions: once in section 1013(c), once in section\n1013(d), and once again in section 1012(a)(4). None of those provisions indicate,\nor in any way suggest, that Trustees are excluded from the category of claimants\nto which they apply. Nor is there any ambiguity as to which provision of section\n1012 governs the payment of such claims. Section 1012(a)(4) expressly governs\n“ the payment of claims in accordance with section [1 0 1 3 ]” (emphasis added),\nwhereas section 1012(a)(2) makes no reference to the section 1013 claims proce­\ndure. The various provisions authorizing payments from the Fund under section 1012,\nmoreover, were drawn with considerable precision. For example, Congress speci­\nfied that only costs incurred by “ Federal, State, or Indian tribe trustees” — but\nnot foreign trustees — could be paid pursuant to section 1012(a)(2). Had the\ncongressional drafters similarly intended to exclude Trustees from the class of\nclaimants eligible to receive payments on their claims under section 1012(a)(4) —\na class that would naturally encompass Trustees under the straightforward defini­\ntions of the statute — it seems unlikely that they would have left such a significant\nexclusion to be inferred. Rather, the exclusion of Trustees’ claims could have\nbeen readily and unambiguously achieved by inserting a single phrase in sub­\nsection (a)(4) — by selectively authorizing, for example, “ (4) the payment of\nclaims, other than payments otherwise authorized under subparagraph (a)(2) of\nthis section , in accordance with section 2713 of this title.” Congress refrained,\nhowever, from drawing any such distinction. 7 It does not appear to be in dispute that OPA’s definition o f “ claimant” includes Trustees who present a claim\nfor natural resource damages compensation under section 1013 o f the Act 193 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 21 The text of OPA, accordingly, seems clearly to provide that the Fund may be\nused to pay the claims of Trustees, pursuant to the provisions of sections\n1012(a)(4) and 1013, without the requirement for annual appropriations. B.\nDOT interprets the relevant provisions of OPA in a different manner. DOT\nasserts that, because section 1012(a)(2) of OPA separately authorizes Fund pay­\nments to Trustees for “ costs incurred,” and because such costs overlap to a large\nextent with the removal costs and uncompensated damages that may form the\nbasis of a claim under section 1012(a)(4), there is a conflict or inconsistency\nbetween the two provisions if the latter also applies to Trustees."
