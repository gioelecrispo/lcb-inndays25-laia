  "chunk_text": "This suggestion misconstrues the purpose o f the proviso. As indicated above,\nthe main clause o f § 406 directs OPM to reduce § 601 payments in response to\nFEPCA. That clause, however, does not specify by how much the payments are to\nbe reduced. It is the proviso that limits O PM ’s discretion in this regard. T he pro­\nviso precludes any reduction of § 601 benefits that “results in a reduction o f the\ntotal pay for any employee of the [NYFD].” In effect, this means that OPM may\nnot reduce § 601 benefits by more than one dollar for every dollar introduced un­\nder FEPCA; if it did, an em ployee’s total pay would be reduced, in violation o f the\n35 Opinions o f th e Office o f L eg a l Counsel proviso. Thus, for each reduction in § 601 paym ents implemented pursuant to the\nmain clause o f § 406, the proviso caps the reduction at the amount of FEPCA dol­\nlars that the em ployee receives, which prevents any net loss of pay. It m ust be understood that the proviso’s protection applies only with respect to\nO PM ’s reduction o f § 601 benefits pursuant to § 406. This much is established by\nthe phrase, “no such reduction,” w hich unmistakably links the proviso’s operation\nwith the preceding clause. See also 2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory\nConstruction §§ 47.08-.09 (5th ed. 1992) (in general, a proviso should be strictly\nconstrued to relate to the enactment o f which it is part). In this case, the reduction\no f pay will occur as a result of the winding down o f § 601 ’s internal clock, and not\npursuant to § 406. Thus, the proviso will not be triggered. Accordingly, § 406\ncannot be said to authorize continued extra pay at the § 601 rate. 2 W ALTER DELLINGER\nA cting A ssistant Attorney General\nOffice o f Legal Counsel 2\nWe can find no references in the legislative history of FEPCA (nor were any presented to us) to suggest\nthat § 406 was intended to continue § 601 benefits beyond their natural span. 36"
