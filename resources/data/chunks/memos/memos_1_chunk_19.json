  "chunk_text": "In this respect, qui tam actions differ fundamental­\nly from the private lawsuits cited by the Solicitor General, and indeed\nfrom all “private attorneys general” suits. These private actions do not\nbind the United States because the real plaintiff is the individual suing on\nhis own independent claim. See, e.g., Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United\nStates, 366 U.S. 683, 690 (1961) ( “the Government is not bound by private\nantitrust litigation to which it is a stranger”). In a qui tam action, howev­\ner, the relator is not really acting in a private capacity, but rather is stand­\ning in the government’s shoes and is prosecuting the United States’ claim. The Solicitor General’s argument that the relator is merely prosecuting\nhis own private claim ultimately fails because it runs headlong into an\nArticle III standing problem. As discussed below, the relator, especially\nwhen suing only in his personal capacity, has no “case or controversy” to\npresent to the court because he can show no “iryury in fact” as a result of\nthe contractor’s alleged fraud. B. Article I I I Standing Private qui tam actions violate the well-settled doctrine o f Article III\nstanding. The keystone of this modem standing doctrine, which has been\ncarefully refined by the Supreme Court over the past 20 years, is the con­\nstitutional requirement of “iryury in fact.” The Supreme Court has repeat­\nedly held that, at an “irreducible minimum,” Article III requires a plaintiff\nin federal court to demonstrate that:\n(1 )\n(2)\ndant;\n(3) he personally has suffered some actual or threatened iryury;\nthe iryury was caused by the putatively illegal conduct o f the defen­\nand\nthe relief sought likely w ill redress the iryury. E.g., Valley Forge Christian Colleqe v. Americans United fo r Separation\no f Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 482-83 (1982); Gladstone Realtors\nv. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99 (1979); Simon v. Eastern Ky.\nWelfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38, 41 (1976). 10 See su p ra p. 215-16. 224 A plaintiff cannot rely solely on abstract iryury or generalized griev­\nances shared by all citizens and taxpayers to establish standing. Allen v.\nWright, 468 U.S. 737, 754 (1984); Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 482-83. If the\nplaintiff himself has not suffered particularized harm that is “distinct and\npalpable,” Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm, to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208,\n221 (1974), there is no case or controversy under Article III. See, e.g.,\nWorth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727\n(1972). Under these well-established principles, qui tam suits are plainly\nunconstitutional to the extent they purport to be private actions because\nthe relator has suffered no personal “injury in fact” as a result o f the con­\ntractor’s alleged fraud. The Solicitor General argues that the relator’s prospect o f receiving a\nbounty is enough to satisfy Article III standing requirements. It is clear,\nhowever, that the mere expectation o f a reward cannot be characterized\nunder established Supreme Court precedent as an “ir\\jury” o f any kind. 11 The only party who suffers iryury as a result o f the contractor’s false\nclaims is the government."
