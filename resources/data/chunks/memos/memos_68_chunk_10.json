  "chunk_text": "Since then, Congress has amended EIGA and reauthorized OGE without modifying the definitions of “executive branch” or “executive agency,” and without\ntaking other action to bring the Smithsonian within OGE’s jurisdiction. See, e.g.,\nAn Act to Reauthorize the Office of Government Ethics, Pub. L. No. 100-598, 102\nStat. 3031 (1988); Office of Government Ethics Authorization Act of 1996, Pub.\nL. No. 104-179, 110 Stat. 1566; see also An Act to Amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 98-150, 97 Stat. 959 (1983). Congress’s repeated\ndecisions not to amend the scope of OGE’s jurisdiction provide further evidence\nthat Congress did not intend for the Institution to be under the supervision of OGE. See Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978) (“Congress is presumed to be\naware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that\ninterpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change . . . .”).
