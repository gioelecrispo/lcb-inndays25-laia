This is consistent with the terms of\n§ 301 (j) barring disclosure of only the information relating to trade secrets that\nis “ entitled to protection.” Other than protecting the manufacturers’ proprie­\ntary interest, there is no general societal value in keeping this information\nconfidential. As mentioned above, § 301(j) only bars disclosure of such trade secrets\ninformation as is “ entitled to protection.” This entitlement runs to the owner of\nthe trade secret who may waive it entirely or in part. See, Kewanee Oil Co. v.\nBicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470 (1974); Underwater Storage, Inc. v. United\nStates Rubber C o., 371 F. (2d) 950 (D.C. Cir. 1966), cert, denied, 386 U.S.\n911 (1967). Thus, the “ entitled to protection” element of § 301 (j) is deter­\nmined by the intent and legitimate interests of the owner of a covered trade\nsecret. Accordingly, the owner may consent to a limited waiver in the pending\nlitigation, thereby permitting the disclosure of the information to be used\ntherein. Cf., Plastic & M etal Fabrications, Inc. v. Roy, 163 Conn. 257, 303 A.\n2d 725 (1972). This comports with the literal language and the spirit of\n§ 3010). For these reasons the Department may properly release the above-described\ndocuments in the pending litigation. M ary C . Law ton Deputy Assistant Attorney General\nOffice o f Legal Counsel 194"
