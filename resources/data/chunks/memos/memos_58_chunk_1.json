May 8, 2002 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL\nOFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS You have asked for our opinion whether the principal conflict of interest rules\nof the Executive Branch apply to a person who has been appointed to an office by\nthe President with the advice and consent of the Senate but has not yet begun the\nduties of that office. 1 We determine that the conflict of interest rules do not apply\nby virtue of the appointment alone but instead apply only after the appointee has\nbegun the duties of his office. I.\nThe principal conflict of interest restrictions that govern the Executive Branch\nare found in the criminal conflict of interest laws, 18 U.S.C. §§ 202-209 (2000);\nthe directives in Executive Order No. 12674, Principles of Ethical Conduct for\nGovernment Officers and Employees, 3 C.F.R. 215 (1989); and the Standards of\nEthical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 5 C.F.R. pt. 2635 (2002)\n(“Standards of Ethical Conduct”). In each case, the reach of the restrictions\ndepends on the meaning of the terms “officer” and “employee.” By their terms, the potentially relevant criminal statutes cover “officers” and\n“employees.” For example, 18 U.S.C. § 203(a)(1)(B) forbids, among other things,\na person’s receipt of compensation for certain representational services rendered\n“at a time when such person is an officer or employee . . . in the executive . . .\nbranch of the government.” Under 18 U.S.C. § 205(a), “[w]hoever, being an\nofficer or employee of the United States in the executive . . . branch of the\nGovernment” acts as an agent or attorney for anyone before an agency or court is\nguilty of a crime. And 18 U.S.C. § 209(a) bars receipt of a salary or supplement to\na salary “as compensation for . . . services as an officer or employee of the\nexecutive branch of the United States Government.” Because title 18 sets out no definition of “officer” or “employee,” we have\nlooked to the definitions in title 5 as “‘the most obvious source of a definition’ for\ntitle 18 purposes.” Applicability of Executive Order No. 12674 to Personnel of\n1\nLetter for M.
