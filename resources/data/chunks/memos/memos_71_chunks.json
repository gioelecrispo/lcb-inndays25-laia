      "content": "Construction o f § 406 of the Federal Employees Pay\nComparability Act of 1990 Section 4 06 o f the Federal E m ployees Pay C om parability Act o f 1990 does not extend the authority to\nm ake bon u s paym ents to em ployees at the N ew York Field D ivision o f the Federal Bureau o f In­\nvestigation pursuant to section 601 of the Intelligence A uthorization Act for fiscal years 1989 and\n1990 b ey o n d the ex p iration date of the dem onstration project established by section 601. August 23, 1993 M O p in io n em orandum fo r th e A s s is t a n t D i r e c t o r , L e g a l C o u n s e l\nF ederal B u r ea u of I n v e s t ig a t io n This m em orandum responds to your request for our opinion whether § 406 of\nthe Federal Em ployees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (“FEPCA”), 104 Stat. 1427, 1467,1 preserves extraordinary benefits payable under § 601 o f the Intelli­\ngence A uthorization Act, Fiscal Y ear 1989, Pub. L. No. 100-453, 102 Stat. 1904,\n1911 (1988), as am ended by the Intelligence Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1990,\nPub. L. No. 101-193, § 601, 103 Stat. 1701, 1710 (1989), even after expiration of\n§ 601 ’s paym ent authority. We conclude that § 406 does not preserve the § 601\nbenefits beyond the expiration of the latter provision. Section 601 establishes a demonstration project that attempts to improve re­\ncruitm ent and retention at the New Y ork Field Division (“NYFD”) of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (“FBI”) by increasing pay. See H.R. Rep. No. 100-591(1),\nat 11-12 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U .S.C.C.A.N. 2469, 2479-80. Pursuant to\n§ 601, any FBI em ployee transferred to the NYFD receives a lump sum payment of\nup to $20,000, conditioned upon the em ployee’s agreement to serve at least three\nyears in that office. § 601(a)(1). In addition, all employees in the NYFD receive\nperiodic bonus paym ents o f between 20 and 25% o f their basic pay for the period\ncovered by the bonus. § 601(a)(2). Section 601(b) provides that these benefits\nwill term inate after five years. We understand from you that the program will end\non Septem ber 30, 1993. FEPCA institutes a system of pay adjustments for general schedule employees\nthroughout the Federal government, including locality pay to accommodate the\nhigher cost o f living in certain areas. Under FEPCA, special agents in the NYFD\ncurrently receive a 16% increase over base pay to account for New Y ork’s higher\ncost o f living. Sim ilarly, support staff who receive pay under the general schedule\n1\nFEPCA was enacted as § 529 of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations\nAct, 1991, Pub L. No. 101-509, 104 Stat. 1389 (1990)."

No. 101-509, 104 Stat. 1389 (1990). All references to provisions o f FEPCA in this\nmemorandum will cite the internal section num bers and corresponding pages in the statutes at large. 34 Construction o f § 406 o f the F E P C A ct o f 1990 receive an 8% increase. Support staff who receive pay under the federal wage\nsystem do not receive any increase. See FEPCA §§ 101, 404, 104 Stat. at 1429-30,\n1466; Exec. Order No. 12786, Schedule 9, reprinted in 5 U.S.C. § 5332 note\n(Supp. Ill 1991). Thus, § 601 and FEPCA each provide extra pay for NYFD employees (except\nfor wage employees who receive benefits under § 601 but not FEPCA). F E P C A ’s\n§ 406, however, instructs the Office of Personnel Management (“O PM ”) to coordi­\nnate the two programs to ensure that their payments are not cumulated:\nNotwithstanding [§601], as amended, the Office of Personnel\nM anagement shall reduce the rate of periodic payments under such\nsection as the provisions o f this Act [FEPCA] are implemented:\nProvided, That no such reduction results in a reduction of the total\npay for any employee o f the New York Field Division of the Fed­\neral Bureau of Investigation. Notwithstanding [§ 601], the Office of\nPersonnel M anagement may make such periodic payments inappli­\ncable to employees newly appointed to, or transferred to, the New\nYork Field Division on or after January 1, 1992. The main clause in the first sentence of § 406 clearly does not authorize a con­\ntinuation of § 601 pay beyond the life of the demonstration project. On the con­\ntrary, it expressly directs OPM to reduce § 601 payments to NYFD employees as\nFEPCA is implemented. The second sentence of § 406 also contemplates the cur­\ntailing of § 601; it instructs that employees hired after January 1, 1992, need not\nreceive any § 601 benefits. Notwithstanding this general thrust o f § 406, it has been suggested that the pro­\nviso in the first sentence might be intended as independent authority to\n“grandfather” current NYFD employees with continued extra pay at the § 601\nlevel. The suggestion is that the proviso forbids any reduction in the total pay o f\nNYFD employees as a result of a reduction in § 601 benefits. Since the term ina­\ntion of § 601 benefits will cause a decrease in the pay of NYFD em ployees\n(because FEPC A ’s benefits are lower and also do not extend to wage employees),\nit is urged that the proviso would prevent any reduction in pay by authorizing con­\ntinued pay at the § 601 level. This suggestion misconstrues the purpose o f the proviso. As indicated above,\nthe main clause o f § 406 directs OPM to reduce § 601 payments in response to\nFEPCA. That clause, however, does not specify by how much the payments are to\nbe reduced."

That clause, however, does not specify by how much the payments are to\nbe reduced. It is the proviso that limits O PM ’s discretion in this regard. T he pro­\nviso precludes any reduction of § 601 benefits that “results in a reduction o f the\ntotal pay for any employee of the [NYFD].” In effect, this means that OPM may\nnot reduce § 601 benefits by more than one dollar for every dollar introduced un­\nder FEPCA; if it did, an em ployee’s total pay would be reduced, in violation o f the\n35 Opinions o f th e Office o f L eg a l Counsel proviso. Thus, for each reduction in § 601 paym ents implemented pursuant to the\nmain clause o f § 406, the proviso caps the reduction at the amount of FEPCA dol­\nlars that the em ployee receives, which prevents any net loss of pay. It m ust be understood that the proviso’s protection applies only with respect to\nO PM ’s reduction o f § 601 benefits pursuant to § 406. This much is established by\nthe phrase, “no such reduction,” w hich unmistakably links the proviso’s operation\nwith the preceding clause. See also 2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory\nConstruction §§ 47.08-.09 (5th ed. 1992) (in general, a proviso should be strictly\nconstrued to relate to the enactment o f which it is part). In this case, the reduction\no f pay will occur as a result of the winding down o f § 601 ’s internal clock, and not\npursuant to § 406. Thus, the proviso will not be triggered. Accordingly, § 406\ncannot be said to authorize continued extra pay at the § 601 rate. 2 W ALTER DELLINGER\nA cting A ssistant Attorney General\nOffice o f Legal Counsel 2\nWe can find no references in the legislative history of FEPCA (nor were any presented to us) to suggest\nthat § 406 was intended to continue § 601 benefits beyond their natural span. 36"
