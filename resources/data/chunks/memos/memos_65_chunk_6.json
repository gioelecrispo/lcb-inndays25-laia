This Act may be cited as the President Kennedy Act,\n1963. 283 Supplemental Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 1 ATTACHMENT 2\nAide-MÃ©moire The Government of Ireland is prepared to promote special legislation to enable\nthe title of Honorary Citizen of Ireland to be conferred on President Kennedy,\ninstead of pursuing the idea of offering citizenship as a token of honor under\nSection 12 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956. A draft bill has been\nprepared with this objective in mind. The text of the bill is conveyed herewith. The Attorney General of Ireland has given opinion that the Bill as drafted\nwould not confer citizenship with its attendant duties and obligations but only a\ntitle of honor. An informal intimation is requested as to whether the title of honor of Honorary\nCitizen of Ireland, as contemplated in the draft bill, would be acceptable to\nPresident Kennedy. April 10, 1963 284"
