November 5, 2001 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE\nASSOCIATE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL You have asked for our opinion whether the Deputy Attorney General has the\nauthority to grant approvals under section 2.5 of Executive Order 12333, 3 C.F.R.\n§ 200 (1981). We believe that he does. Executive Order 12333 addresses the conduct of intelligence activities. Section\n2.5 provides: The Attorney General hereby is delegated the power to approve the\nuse for intelligence purposes, within the United States or against a\nUnited States person abroad, of any technique for which a warrant\nwould be required if undertaken for law enforcement purposes, provided that such technique shall not be undertaken unless the Attorney\nGeneral has determined in each case that there is probable cause to\nbelieve that the technique is directed against a foreign power or an\nagent of a foreign power. Electronic surveillance, as defined in the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 [“FISA”], shall be\nconducted in accordance with that Act, as well as this Order. Under the Department’s regulations, the Deputy Attorney General “is authorized\nto exercise all the power and authority of the Attorney General, unless any such\npower or authority is required by law to be exercised by the Attorney General\npersonally.” 28 C.F.R. § 0.15(a) (2000). That regulation rests on the Attorney\nGeneral’s statutory authority to “make such provisions as he considers appropriate\nauthorizing the performance by any other officer, employee, or agency of the\nDepartment of Justice of any function of the Attorney General.” 28 U.S.C. § 510\n(1994). Consequently, the Deputy Attorney General may exercise the Attorney\nGeneral’s power under section 2.5 of the Executive Order, unless by law the\nAttorney General must exercise that power personally. No statute reserves to the Attorney General the power to grant approvals under\nsection 2.5, although one statute arguably is relevant to the question. Under\n3 U.S.C. § 301 (2000), the President may delegate any “function which is vested\nin the President by law” to the head of any department or agency in the Executive\nBranch or to any official of a department or agency required to be appointed with\nSenate confirmation. When the President uses this statute to delegate a function, 236 227-329 VOL_25_PROOF.pdf 246 10/22/12 11:10 AM Authority of the Deputy Attorney General Under Executive Order 12333 we have concluded that the power may be redelegated only to officials who\noccupy Senate-confirmed positions and would also qualify under the statute to\nreceive delegations directly from the President. See Memorandum for Richard W.\nMcLaren, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, from William H.\nRehnquist, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Revision of\nProclamation 3279 (Oil Import Controls) and Implementing Regulations at 1\n(Jan. 4, 1971)."
