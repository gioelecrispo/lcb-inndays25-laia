      "content": "Recess Appointments Amid Pro Forma Senate Sessions A twenty-day Senate recess may give rise to presidential authority to make recess appointments. Congress’s provision for pro forma sessions during that twenty-day period does not have\nthe legal effect of interrupting the recess for purposes of the Recess Appointments\nClause. In this context, the President has discretion to conclude that the Senate is unavailable to\nperform its advise-and-consent function and may exercise his power to make recess\nappointments. January 6, 2012 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT *\nOn December 17, 2011, the Senate agreed by unanimous consent to\n“adjourn and convene for pro forma sessions only, with no business\nconducted,” every Tuesday and Friday between that date and January 23,\n2012. 157 Cong. Rec. S8783 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2011). During that period, on January 3, 2012, the Senate convened one such pro forma session\nto begin the second session of the 112th Congress and adjourned less than\na minute later under its prior agreement. 158 Cong. Rec. S1 (daily ed.\nJan. 3, 2012); see also U.S. Const. amend. XX, § 2. You asked whether\nthe President has authority under the Recess Appointments Clause, U.S.\nConst. art. II, § 2, cl. 3, to make recess appointments during the period\nbetween January 3 and January 23 notwithstanding the convening of\nperiodic pro forma sessions. We advised you that he does. This opinion\nmemorializes and elaborates on that advice. This Office has consistently advised that “a recess during a session of\nthe Senate, at least if it is of sufficient length, can be a ‘Recess’ within the\nmeaning of the Recess Appointments Clause” during which the President\nmay exercise his power to fill vacant offices. Memorandum for Alberto R.\n* Editor’s Note: The Supreme Court considered the questions addressed in this opinion\nin NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513 (2014), and held that the Recess Appointments\nClause empowers the President to fill vacancies during intrasession recesses “of substantial length,” but that the Senate is in session for purposes of the Clause during a pro forma\nsession in which the Senate retains the capacity to conduct business under its rules. Id. at\n527, 550. The Court therefore held that three appointments made by President Obama\nduring the period at issue in this opinion were invalid. Id. at 557. 15 36 Op.

Goldsmith III, Assistant\nAttorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Recess Appointments in\nthe Current Recess of the Senate at 1 (Feb. 20, 2004) (“Goldsmith Memorandum”). 1 Although the Senate will have held pro forma sessions regularly from January 3 through January 23, in our judgment, those sessions\ndo not interrupt the intrasession recess in a manner that would preclude\nthe President from determining that the Senate remains unavailable\nthroughout to “‘receive communications from the President or participate\nas a body in making appointments.’” Intrasession Recess Appointments,\n13 Op. O.L.C. 271, 272 (1989) (quoting Executive Power—Recess Appointments, 33 Op. Att’y Gen. 20, 24 (1921) (“Daugherty Opinion”)). Thus, the President has the authority under the Recess Appointments\nClause to make appointments during this period."

I.\nBeginning in late 2007, and continuing into the 112th Congress, the\nSenate has frequently conducted pro forma sessions during recesses\noccurring within sessions of Congress.

The Senate’s web page on\nthe sessions of Congress, which defines a recess as “a break in House or\nSenate proceedings of three days or more, excluding Sundays,” treats such\na period of recess as unitary, rather than breaking it into three-day segments.

Doc. No. 112-1, at 58 (2011) (“Senate\nStanding Rules”). This omission may reflect the Executive Clerk’s treatment of that impending recess as a series of shorter adjournments rather\nthan a single thirty-eight-day recess. II. To address the President’s authority to make recess appointments during a recess including pro forma sessions, we consider two distinct issues: The first is whether the President has authority to make a recess appointment during the recess at issue here, an intrasession recess of twenty days. We conclude that he does. The opinions of the Attorney General and this\nOffice, historical practice, and the limited judicial authority that exists all\nprovide strong support for that conclusion. Thereafter, we consider whether the President is disabled from making\nan appointment when the recess is punctuated by periodic pro forma\nsessions at which Congress has declared in advance that no business is to\nbe conducted."

Elwood,\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Lawfulness of Making Recess Appointment During Adjournment of the Senate\nNotwithstanding Periodic “Pro Forma Sessions” (Jan. 9, 2009). A.\nThe Recess Appointments Clause of the Constitution provides that\n“[t]he President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen\nduring the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall\nexpire at the End of their next Session.” U.S. Const. art.

Under a framework first articulated by Attorney General Daugherty in\n1921, and subsequently reaffirmed and applied by several opinions of\nthe Attorney General and this Office, the “constitutional test for whether\na recess appointment is permissible is whether the adjournment of the\nSenate is of such duration that the Senate could ‘not receive communications from the President or participate as a body in making appointments.’” Intrasession Recess Appointments, 13 Op.

See Congressional Directory 522–25 (listing five intrasession recesses before the Civil War, ranging from five to twelve days\nin length). But as intrasession recesses became common, so too did intrasession recess appointments. President Johnson is believed to have\nmade the first intrasession recess appointments in 1867. Henry B. Hogue,\nThe Law: Recess Appointments to Article III Courts, 34 Presidential Stud.\nQ. 656, 666 (2004). 8 “The length of the recess may have triggered the\nappointments, because none of the intrasession recesses taken by the\nSenate until that time had lasted more than 15 days.” Id.

The last five Presidents have all made appointments during intrasession recesses of fourteen\ndays or fewer. 9 There is significant (albeit not uniform) evidence that the Executive\nBranch’s view that recess appointments during intrasession recesses are\nconstitutional has been accepted by Congress and its officers. Most relevant, in our view, is the Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. § 5503 (2006), which sets out\nthe circumstances in which a recess appointee may be paid a salary from\nthe Treasury. The Attorney General has long taken the position that the\nAct constitutes congressional acquiescence to recess appointments under\ncircumstances where the Act would permit payment. See Recess Appointments, 41 Op. Att’y Gen. at 466. In 1948, the Comptroller General considered whether the Act permitted the payment of officials appointed\nduring an intrasession recess. Appointments—Recess Appointments, 28\nComp. Gen. 30 (1948). After acknowledging the “accepted view” that an\nintrasession recess “is a recess during which an appointment may properly\nbe made,” the Comptroller General concluded that the Act was intended\nto permit payment to all who are appointed “during periods when the\nFor example, using the method of counting explained above, see supra note 1, President Obama made three recess appointments during a twelve-day recess; President George\nW.

In the\nonly federal court of appeals decision squarely on point, the en banc\nEleventh Circuit upheld the recess appointment of a judge made during an\neleven-day intrasession recess. See Evans, 387 F.3d at 1224–26 (concluding “Recess of the Senate” as used in the Recess Appointments Clause\nincludes intrasession recesses and declining to set a lower limit on their\nlength). But see id. at 1228 n.2 (“Although I would not reach this ques10 Certain language in an 1863 report of the Senate Judiciary Committee could be read\nto suggest that the Committee believed that recess appointments could be made only\nduring intersession recesses. See S. Rep. No. 37-80, at 3 (1863) (“It cannot, we think, be\ndisputed that the period of time designated in the clause as ‘the recess of the Senate,’\nincludes the space beginning with the indivisible point of time which next follows that at\nwhich it adjourned, and ending with that which next precedes the moment of the commencement of their next session.”). But the question addressed by the Committee in 1863\nrelated to timing of the occurrence of the vacancy, not the nature of the recess during\nwhich the vacancy occurred. Moreover, a subsequent report by the Committee defined a\nrecess functionally in terms that have since been adopted by the Attorney General and this\nOffice as setting forth the test for determining when an intrasession recess is of sufficient\nlength to give rise to the President’s power under the Recess Appointments Clause. See\nS. Rep. No. 58-4389, at 2 (1905) (defining a recess as “the period of time . . . when,\nbecause of its absence, [the Senate] can not receive communications from the President or\nparticipate as a body in making appointments”); see also infra pp. 32–33. A draft legal brief prepared, but never filed, by the Senate Legal Counsel in 1993 took\nthe position that “the text and purpose of the Recess Appointments Clause both demonstrate that the recess power is limited to Congress’ annual recess between sessions.” 139\nCong.

Lower courts, too, have recognized the President’s power to make intrasession recess appointments. See Nippon Steel Corp. v. Int’l Trade Comm’n, 239 F. Supp. 2d 1367,\n1374 n.13 (Ct.

The Supreme\nCourt, however, has never decided the issue. 11\nDue to this limited judicial authority, we cannot predict with certainty\nhow courts will react to challenges of appointments made during intrasession recesses, particularly short ones. 12 If an official appointed during the\ncurrent recess takes action that gives rise to a justiciable claim, litigants\nmight challenge the appointment on the ground that the Constitution’s\nreference to “the Recess of the Senate” contemplates only the recess at the\nend of a session. That argument and the Department of Justice’s response\n11 Justice Stevens filed a statement respecting the denial of certiorari in Evans expressing his view that the “case . . . raises significant constitutional questions regarding the\nPresident’s intrasession appointment” of a circuit judge and that “it would be a mistake to\nassume that our disposition of this petition constitutes a decision on the merits of whether\nthe President has the constitutional authority to fill future Article III vacancies, such as\nvacancies on this Court, with appointments made absent consent of the Senate during\nshort intrasession ‘recesses.’” Evans v. Stephens, 544 U.S. 942, 942–43 (2005) (Stevens,\nJ., respecting denial of certiorari). It is unclear whether the Justice’s concerns related\nspecifically to recess appointments of Article III judges or extended to executive branch\nappointments. 12 Scholarly opinion is divided on the proper interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause, although advocates for a more limited recess appointment power recognize\nthat their view has not prevailed.

See, e.g., Brief for the Intervenor United States, Stephens,\n387 F.3d 1220 (No. 02-16424); Response Brief of Plaintiffs-Appellees\nand United States Senator Edward M. Kennedy as Amicus Curiae Supporting Plaintiffs-Appellees, Stephens, 387 F.3d 1220 (No. 02-16424); see\nalso supra note 11. We conclude that the President’s authority to make recess appointments\nextends to an intrasession recess of twenty days. B.\nThe second question we consider is whether Congress can prevent the\nPresident from making appointments during a recess by providing for pro\nforma sessions at which no business is to be conducted, where those pro\nforma sessions are intended to divide a longer recess into a series of\nshorter adjournments, each arguably too brief to support the President’s\nrecess appointment authority. We believe that Congress’s provision for\npro forma sessions of this sort does not have the legal effect of interrupting the recess of the Senate for purposes of the Recess Appointments\nClause and that the President may properly conclude that the Senate is\nunavailable for the overall duration of the recess. 13\n13 Because we conclude that pro forma sessions do not have this effect, we need not\ndecide whether the President could make a recess appointment during a three-day\nintrasession recess. This Office has not formally concluded that there is a lower limit to\nthe duration of a recess within which the President can make a recess appointment. Attorney General Daugherty suggested in dictum in his 1921 opinion that “an adjournment of 5 or even 10 days [could not] be said to constitute the recess intended by the\nConstitution,” 33 Op. Att’y Gen. at 25. As a result, “[t]his Office has generally advised\nthat the President not make recess appointments, if possible, when the break in continuity\nof the Senate is very brief,” The Pocket Veto: Historical Practice and Judicial Precedent,\n6 Op. O.L.C. 134, 149 (1982); see, e.g., Recess Appointments—Compensation (5 U.S.C.\n§ 5503), 3 Op. O.L.C. 314, 315–16 (1979) (describing informal advice against making\nrecess appointments during a six-day intrasession recess in 1970). Notwithstanding\nAttorney General Daugherty’s caution, we advised in 1996 that “recess appointments\nduring [a] 10-day intrasession recess would be constitutionally defensible,” although they\nwould “pose significant litigation risks.” Memorandum for John M.

The Clause was necessary because\n“it would have been improper to oblige [the Senate] to be continually in\nsession for the appointment of officers,” and it “might be necessary for\nthe public service to fill [vacancies] without delay.” Id. at 410. Other contemporaneous writings likewise emphasize that the recess\nappointment power is required to address situations in which the Senate is\nunable to provide advice and consent on appointments.

Therefore the executive ought to make temporary appointments, as well as\nreceive ambassadors and other public ministers. This power can be vested\nnowhere but in the executive, because he is perpetually acting for the\npublic; for, though the Senate is to advise him in the appointment of\nofficers, &c., yet, during the recess, the President must do this business,\nor else it will be neglected; and such neglect may occasion public inconveniences.”); cf. Letters of Cato IV, reprinted in 2 The Complete AntiFederalist 114 (Herbert J. Storing ed., 1981) (“Though the president,\nduring the sitting of the legislature, is assisted by the senate, yet he is\nwithout a constitutional council in their recess . . . .”). 15 Thus, from the\ndays of the Founding, the Recess Appointments Clause has been considered implicated when the Senate is not “in session for the appointment of\nofficers.” The Federalist No. 67, at 410. Nineteenth-century sources reflect this understanding. Justice Story\nframed the issue in terms of the Senate’s ability to review nominations:\n15 See also 2 Elliott’s Debates 513 (statement of James Wilson at Pennsylvania ratification convention) (“[T]here is only left the power of concurring in the appointment of\nofficers; but care is taken, in this Constitution, that this branch of business may be done\nwithout [the Senate’s] presence”); id. at 534 (statement of Thomas M’Kean) (Dec. 11,\n1787) (“Nor need the Senate be under any necessity of sitting constantly, as has been\nalleged; for there is an express provision made to enable the President to fill up all\nvacancies that may happen during their recess[.]”); 3 Elliott’s Debates 409–10 (statement\nof James Madison at the Virginia convention) (“There will not be occasion for the continual residence of the senators at the seat of government. . . .

O.L.C. 15 (2012) “There was but one of two courses to be adopted [at the Founding]; either,\nthat the senate should be perpetually in session, in order to provide for the\nappointment of officers; or, that the president should be authorized to\nmake temporary appointments during the recess, which should expire,\nwhen the senate should have had an opportunity to act on the subject.” 3 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States\n§ 1551, at 410 (1833); id. § 1552, at 411 (discussing renomination when\n“the senate is assembled”). And as early as the Monroe Administration,\nthe Executive Branch’s analysis of the Clause had begun to focus on the\navailability of the Senate to be consulted on nominations. See, e.g., Executive Authority to Fill Vacancies, 1 Op. Att’y Gen. 631, 633 (1823)\n(“[A]ll vacancies which . . . happen to exist at a time when the Senate\ncannot be consulted as to filling them, may be temporarily filled by the\nPresident[.]”) (emphasis added); Power of President to Fill Vacancies,\n3 Op. Att’y Gen. 673, 676 (1841) (“[T]he convention very wisely provided against the possibility of such evils [i.e., “interregna in the executive\npowers”] by enabling and requiring the President to keep full every office\nof the government during a recess of the Senate, when his advisers could\nnot be consulted [.]”) (emphasis added); Power of President to Appoint to\nOffice during Recess of Senate, 4 Op.

[T]his vacancy happening from the inaction of the Senate on the\nnomination made[] is within the meaning of the [Recess Appointments\nClause], and may be filled by an Executive Appointment.” (emphasis\nadded)). Opinions of the Attorney General have construed the Clause in order to\nfulfill its purpose that there be an uninterrupted power to fill federal\noffices. Thus, Attorney General Wirt advised in 1823 that “whensoever a\nvacancy shall exist which the public interests require to be immediately\nfilled, and in filling which, the advice and consent of the Senate cannot be\nimmediately asked, because of their recess, the President shall have the\npower of filling it by an appointment” because “[t]he substantial purpose\nof the constitution was to keep these offices filled; and powers adequate\nto this purpose were intended to be conveyed.” Executive Authority to Fill\nVacancies, 1 Op.

In his seminal opinion concluding that a significant intrasession\nadjournment is a “recess” in which recess appointments can be made,\nAttorney General Daugherty focused on this point: “Regardless of whether the Senate has adjourned or recessed, the real question . . . is whether in\na practical sense the Senate is in session so that its advice and consent\ncan be obtained.” Daugherty Opinion, 33 Op.

Our conclusion rests on three considerations. First, both the Framers’ original understanding of the Recess Appointments Clause and the longstanding views of the Executive and Legislative\nBranches support the conclusion that the President may make recess\nappointments when he determines that, as a practical matter, the Senate is\nnot available to give advice and consent to executive nominations. The\nRecess Appointments Clause was adopted to allow the President to fill\noffices when the Senate was not “in session for the appointment of officers.” The Federalist No. 67, at 410 (Alexander Hamilton). And, from the\nearly days of the Republic, the Executive has taken the position that “all\nvacancies which . . . happen to exist at a time when the Senate cannot be\nconsulted as to filling them, may be temporarily filled by the President.” Executive Authority to Fill Vacancies, 1 Op. Att’y Gen. at 633. Likewise,\nin 1905, the Senate Judiciary Committee defined “recess” as used in the\nClause to be the period of time when the Senate cannot “participate as a\nbody in making appointments.” S. Rep. No. 58-4389, at 2. We do not believe that the convening of periodic pro forma sessions\nprecludes the President from determining that the Senate is unavailable\nduring an intrasession recess otherwise long enough to support the President’s recess appointment authority. During the last three Congresses,\nsuch sessions ordinarily have lasted only a few seconds. See, e.g., 157\nCong. Rec. D1404 (daily ed. Dec. 30, 2011) (noting that day’s pro forma\nsession lasted from 11:00:02 until 11:00:34 a.m.); see also supra note 2.\n33 36 Op. O.L.C. 15 (2012) Records of the sessions typically do not disclose the presence of any\nSenator other than the single convening member. See, e.g., 157 Cong.\nRec. S8793 (daily ed. Dec. 30, 2011) (reflecting the presence of only\nSenator Reed). And importantly, the pertinent Senate order states in\nadvance that there is to be “no business conducted” during the ensuing\nsessions. See, e.g., 157 Cong. Rec. S8783 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2011); see\nalso supra pp. 16–17. 17 The purpose of these sessions avowedly is not to\nconduct business; instead, either the Senate has intended to prevent the\nPresident from making recess appointments during its absence or the\nHouse has intended to require the Senate to remain in session (toward the\nsame end). See supra pp. 17–18; see also Henry B. Hogue, Cong. Research Serv., RS21308, Recess Appointments: Frequently Asked Questions 3 (rev. Mar. 2008) (noting use of such sessions “for the stated purpose of preventing [recess] appointments”).

We recognize that, as a\npractical matter, neither the scheduling order nor the quorum requirement will always\nprevent the Senate from acting without a quorum through unanimous consent. Indeed,\nthe Senate has occasionally enacted legislation by unanimous consent during pro forma\nsessions. See infra p. 45. But as more fully explained below, we do not believe that this\nsporadic practice requires the President to consider the Senate available to perform its\nconstitutional functions when it is in recess and, particularly, when it has provided by\norder that no business will be conducted. 34 Recess Appointments Amid Pro Forma Senate Sessions erty Opinion, 33 Op. Att’y Gen. at 25 (discussing the President’s “large,\nalthough not unlimited, discretion to determine when there is a real and\ngenuine recess making it impossible for him to receive the advice and\nconsent of the Senate”).

See supra note 5 & accompanying text. And the Senate has made\nspecial arrangements for the appointment of its own officers during the\nrecess, in apparent recognition of the fact that it will not be in session for\nthe purpose of making appointments under its usual procedures.

By the same reasoning, brief pro forma sessions of this\nsort, at which the Senate is not capable of acting on nominations, may be\nproperly viewed as insufficient to terminate an ongoing recess for purposes of the Clause. 18\nThis view of the effect of pro forma sessions on the President’s recess\nappointment power finds additional support in one of this Office’s prior\nopinions, Recess Appointments During an Intrasession Recess, 16 Op.\nO.L.C. 15. That opinion addressed the propriety of making recess appointments during a recess that began on January 3, 1992, and ended on\nJanuary 21, 1992. We noted that, aside from a “brief formal session on\nJanuary 3” at which the body conducted no business (and which evidently\nwas held to address the terms of the Twentieth Amendment, see infra note\n22), the Senate had been in recess since November 27, 1991. 16 Op.\nO.L.C. at 15 n.1. Thus, we observed that “[f]or practical purposes with In reaching this conclusion, we need not look behind the actual terms of the Senate’s\norders. The Senate itself labels the sessions “pro forma” and specifies that there is to be\n“no business conducted” during those sessions. See, e.g., 157 Cong. Rec. S8783 (daily ed.\nDec. 17, 2011). These orders make clear that the Senate cannot perform its advise-andconsent role during the pro forma sessions. The issue we have been asked to address\nrelates to the legal effect of such sessions on the intrasession recess, and the Senate orders\non their face warrant the conclusion that the Senate is unavailable to provide advice and\nconsent during the intrasession recess. 18 35 36 Op. O.L.C. 15 (2012) respect to nominations, this recess closely resembles one of substantially\ngreater length.” Id. To be sure, this Office there stated only that two\nrecesses broken solely by a pro forma session “closely resemble[]” a\nsingle recess of greater length, not that they were constitutionally indistinguishable from one. Nevertheless, we thought the effective length of the\nrecess relevant in determining whether the President could make a recess\nappointment. The same consideration applies here. A lengthy intrasession\nrecess broken only by pro forma sessions closely resembles an unbroken\nrecess of the same length; thus, “[e]xcept for its brief formal session[s]\n. . . the Senate will have been absent from [January 3, 2012] until [January\n23, 2012], a period of [twenty] days.” Id. And in determining whether\nsuch a recess triggers the President’s appointment authority under the\nRecess Appointments Clause, we believe the critical inquiry is the “practical” one identified above—to wit, whether the Senate is available to\nperform its advise-and-consent function. For practical purposes, the\nPresident may properly view the Senate as unavailable for twenty days. Second, allowing the Senate to prevent the President from exercising\nhis authority under the Recess Appointments Clause by holding pro forma\nsessions would be inconsistent with both the purpose of the Clause and\nhistorical practice in analogous situations."

Second, allowing the Senate to prevent the President from exercising\nhis authority under the Recess Appointments Clause by holding pro forma\nsessions would be inconsistent with both the purpose of the Clause and\nhistorical practice in analogous situations. As explained above, the Recess\nAppointments Clause has long been understood as intended to provide a\nmethod of appointment when the Senate was unavailable to provide\nadvice and consent, so that offices would not remain vacant to the detriment of the public interest. If the Senate can avoid a “Recess of the Senate” under the Clause by having a single Member “gavel in” before an\nempty chamber, then the Senate can preclude the President from making\nrecess appointments even when, as a practical matter, it is unavailable to\nfulfill its constitutional role in the appointment process for a significant\nperiod of time. The purpose of the Clause is better served by a construction that permits the President to make recess appointments when the\nSenate is unavailable to advise and consent for lengthy periods. See Power of President to Fill Vacancies, 2 Op. Att’y Gen. 525, 526–27 (1832)\n(“[A] construction that defeats the very object of the grant of power\ncannot be the true one. It was the intention of the constitution that the\noffices created by law, and necessary to carry on the operations of the\ngovernment, should always be full, or, at all events, that the vacancy\nshould not be a protracted one.”); cf. Wright v. United States, 302 U.S.\n36 Recess Appointments Amid Pro Forma Senate Sessions 583, 596 (1938) (“We should not adopt a construction [of the Veto Clauses] which would frustrate either of the[ir] purposes.”). Further, Presidents have routinely exercised their constitutional authority to make recess appointments between sessions of Congress since President Washington made such appointments in the earliest days of the\nRepublic. Although we have focused in this opinion on the twenty-day\nintrasession recess at the beginning of the second session, the Senate in\nfact adjourned pursuant to an order that provided that there would also be\n“no business conducted” for the final seventeen days of the first session. This period of time, a total of thirty-seven days, in substance closely\nresembles a lengthy intersession recess. See Recess Appointments During\nan Intrasession Recess, 16 Op. O.L.C. at 15 n.1.

In our\njudgment, these points, while not insubstantial, do not overcome the\nconclusion presented above. First, we considered that the Senate has employed pro forma sessions\nin other contexts and that, in those contexts, a pro forma session may\nhave the same legal effect as any other session and thus may fulfill certain constitutional requirements. For example, pro forma sessions are\nmost commonly used to address the requirement that “[n]either House,\nduring the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other,\nadjourn for more than three days.” U.S. Const. art.

There is no evidence of a\nRiddick’s Senate Procedure identifies several examples in which “the Senate pursuant to a previous order has met for very brief periods and recessed over until a subsequent\ndate, not in excess of 3 days,” the earliest of which occurred in 1949.

XX, § 2 (“Congress shall assemble at least once in every year,\nand such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January, unless they shall by law\nappoint a different day.”). Congress routinely enacts legislation when it wishes to vary the\ndate of its first meeting. See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 111-289 (2010); Pub. L. No. 105-350\n(1998); Pub. L. No. 99-613 (1986); Pub. L.

Occasionally, however,\nCongress (or an individual House) uses a pro forma session to comply with the Twentieth\nAmendment’s default date. The first such use of a pro forma session that we are aware of\noccurred in 1980. See H.R. Con. Res. 232, 96th Cong., 93 Stat. 1438 (1979) (“[W]hen the\nCongress convenes on January 3, 1980, . . . neither the House nor the Senate shall conduct\norganizational or legislative business until Tuesday, January 22, 1980, [unless convened\nsooner by House and Senate leaders].”). Thereafter, it appears to have remained rare until\nthe last decade. See H.R. Con. Res. 260, 102d Cong., 105 Stat. 2446 (1991) (providing\nthat neither House shall “conduct organizational or legislative business” on January 3,\n1992); 151 Cong. Rec. S14,421 (daily ed.

O.L.C. 15 (2012) tradition of using pro forma sessions to prevent a “recess” within the\nmeaning of the Recess Appointments Clause. That attempt began in 2007\nwith the 110th Congress. 24 There may be at least a limited tradition of a\nHouse of Congress using consecutive pro forma sessions to avoid adjournments of more than three days without obtaining the other House’s\nconsent. 25 But past uses of pro forma sessions for housekeeping purposes\nare not good analogies for the current use of pro forma sessions to block\nappointments under the Recess Appointments Clause. The former uses\naffect the operations of only the House in question, and the Constitution\nprovides that “[e]ach House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,”\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 5, cl. 2. Even uses in connection with interchamber\nrelations affect the Legislative Branch alone. The question whether the 24 It does appear, though, that the use of pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments was at least contemplated as early as the 1980s. See 145 Cong. Rec. 29,915 (1999)\n(statement of Sen. Inhofe) (“[Senator Byrd] extracted from [the President] a commitment\nin writing that he would not make recess appointments and, if it should become necessary\nbecause of extraordinary circumstances to make recess appointments, that he would give\nthe list to the majority leader . . . in sufficient time in advance that they could prepare for\nit either by agreeing in advance to the confirmation of that appointment or by not going\ninto recess and staying in pro forma so the recess appointments could not take place.”). 25 For example, in 1929, a concurrent resolution provided that the House return from\nsummer recess on September 23, 71 Cong. Rec. 3045 (June 18, 1929). The House passed\na separate resolution providing that “after September 23, 1929, the House shall meet only\non Mondays and Thursdays of each week until October 14, 1929,” provided that the\nSpeaker could call them back sooner if “legislative expediency shall warrant it,” id. at\n3228 (June 19, 1929). Although it was not so stated in the text of the resolution, it was\n“agreed that there shall be nothing transacted [during the Monday and Thursday sessions]\nexcept to convene and adjourn; no business whatever.” Id. at 3229 (statement of Rep.\nTilson); see also 8 Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives § 3369, at 820\n(1935) (describing this incident as one in which the House “provid[ed] for merely formal\nsessions”). This arrangement was subsequently extended twice. 71 Cong. Rec. 4531–32\n(Oct. 14, 1929) (H.R. Res. 59, described by Rep.

Subsequent examples from the Senate involve more formal agreements to the pro forma nature of the sessions. See, e.g., 96 Cong. Rec. 16,980 (Dec. 22,\n1950) (setting schedule of two consecutive pro forma sessions); id. at 17,020 (Dec. 26,\n1950); id. at 17,022 (Dec. 29, 1950); 126 Cong.

Assuming that such uses are constitutional,\nhowever, it does not follow that pro forma sessions may be used to prevent the President from exercising his constitutional authority to make\nrecess appointments when he determines that the Senate is unavailable to\nprovide advice and consent. 26 Put differently, whether the House has\nconsented to the Senate’s adjournment of more than three days does not\ndetermine the Senate’s practical availability during a period of pro forma\nsessions and thus does not determine the existence of a “Recess” under\nthe Recess Appointments Clause. Second, it might be argued that, in light of the Senate’s power to “determine the Rules of its Proceedings,” U.S. Const. art. I, § 5, cl. 2, the\nExecutive Branch would be bound by the Chamber’s own understanding\nof whether the pro forma sessions have the legal effect of interrupting a\n“Recess of the Senate” for the purposes of the Recess Appointments\nClause. The Rules of Proceedings Clause has been understood to grant the\nHouses of Congress broad discretion in managing their internal affairs. See, e.g., United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892) (“[A]ll matters of\nmethod [of proceeding] are open to the determination of the house, and it\nis no impeachment of the rule to say that some other way would be better,\nmore accurate or even more just.”). That Clause might also be understood\nto permit them conclusively to determine when they are in session and\nwhen they are in recess. See, e.g., Michael Herz, Abandoning Recess\nAppointments?: A Comment on Hartnett (and Others), 26 Cardozo L.\nRev. 443, 459 (2005) (“I would think that pursuant to the authority of\neach House to make rules for its own proceedings Congress could decide\nto hold twelve ‘sessions’ each calendar year, with a few days off—\nperhaps just a weekend—between them.”); cf.

Dixon, Assistant Attorney General, Office of\nLegal Counsel at 4 –5 (Dec. 4, 1973) (“Under Section 2 of H.R. 7386, Congress could\nprevent the exercise of a pocket veto, except at the close of a Congress, when one or both\nHouses adjourned for several months, by adjourning either to a date certain or pro forma\nto a date close to the beginning of the next working session. . . . To the extent that H.R.\n7386 unconstitutionally permits Congress to keep a bill in suspended animation for\nlengthy periods during adjournments other than sine die, it unconstitutionally narrows the\nPresident’s pocket veto authority.”). 26 43 36 Op. O.L.C. 15 (2012) Rev. 557, 567 (1972) (“Surely the determination of what constitutes\nadjournment is a ‘proceeding’ within the terms of that section [the\nRules of Proceeding Clause].”). The Supreme Court, however, has made clear that Congress’s power\nunder this provision is not unlimited, and specifically that Congress “may\nnot by its rules ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental\nrights.” Ballin, 144 U.S. at 5. Thus, the validity and application of congressional rules are subject to review in court when the rules affect interests outside of the Legislative Branch. See, e.g., United States v. Smith,\n286 U.S. 6, 33 (1932) (“As the construction to be given the rules affects\npersons other than members of the Senate, the question presented is of\nnecessity a judicial one.”); Ballin, 144 U.S. at 5 (“[T]here should be a\nreasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is sought to be attained.”); Vander\nJagt v. O’Neill, 699 F.2d 1166, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“Article I does not\nalter our judicial responsibility to say what rules Congress may not adopt\nbecause of constitutional infirmity.”). A Senate rule that pro forma sessions interrupt a “Recess of the Senate” (or that otherwise seeks to prevent the President from exercising authority under the Recess Appointments Clause) would affect other persons—the President and potential\nappointees at the least. It would also disrupt the Constitution’s balancing\nof executive and legislative authority in the appointments process. To be\nsure, as explained above, the President’s authority to make recess appointments is constrained when the Senate is continuously in session and\navailable to perform its advise-and-consent function. But the Senate could\nnot by rule unilaterally prevent the President from exercising his authority\nto make temporary appointments under the Clause by declaring itself in\nsession when, in practice, it is not available to provide advice and consent, any more than the President could make a recess appointment when\nthe Senate was in practice available to do so. See Daugherty Opinion, 33\nOp. Att’y Gen. at 25 (recognizing that a “palpable abuse” of the President’s “discretion to determine when there is a real and genuine recess” of\nthe Senate might subject his appointment to review”)."

Twice in 2011, the Senate passed legislation during pro forma sessions by\nunanimous consent, evidenced by the lack of objection from any member\nwho might have been present at the time. 157 Cong. Rec. S8789 (daily ed.\nDec. 23, 2011); id. at S5297 (daily ed. Aug. 5, 2011). During one of these\nsessions, the Senate also agreed to a conference with the House, and\nmessages received from the House earlier in the intrasession recess were\nput into the Congressional Record. 157 Cong. Rec. S8789–90 (daily ed.\nDec. 23, 2011). Conceivably, the Senate might provide advice and consent on pending nominations during a pro forma session in the same\nmanner. We do not believe, however, that these examples prevent the President\nfrom determining that the Senate remains unavailable to provide advice\nand consent during the present intrasession recess. The scheduling order\nunder which the pro forma sessions are held during this recess expressly\nprovides that there is to be “no business conducted.” 157 Cong. Rec.\nS8783 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2001). In our judgment, the President may\nproperly rely on the public pronouncements of the Senate that it will not\nconduct business (including action on nominations), in determining\nwhether the Senate remains in recess, regardless of whether the Senate has\ndisregarded its own orders on prior occasions. Moreover, even absent a\nSenate pronouncement that it will not conduct business, there may be\ncircumstances in which the President could properly conclude that the\nbody is not available to provide advice and consent for a sufficient period\nto support the use of his recess appointment power. It is common for\nSawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952). The Constitution explicitly grants recess appointment\nauthority to the President, and the Attorney General has long taken the position that,\nthrough enactment of the Pay Act, Congress has “acquiesce[d]” to recess appointments\nunder circumstances where that Act would permit payment. See Recess Appointments, 41\nOp. Att’y Gen. at 466; see also Appointments—Recess Appointments, 28 Comp. Gen. at\n34, 37 (recognizing the “accepted view” that an extended intrasession adjournment of the\nSenate is a “recess” in the constitutional sense during which “an appointment properly\nmay be made” and that recipients of such appointments were entitled to pay). Moreover, it\nis unclear that Justice Jackson’s framework would apply in matters involving the balance\nbetween the President’s constitutional authority to make recess appointments and a single\nHouse of Congress’s constitutional authority to set its internal rules. 45"

O.L.C. 15 (2012) resolutions of adjournment authorizing extended intrasession recesses to\nprovide that the Senate “stand[s] recessed or adjourned until [a specified\ndate], . . . or until the time of any reassembly” ordered by the leaders of\nthe two Houses “as they may designate whenever, in their opinion, the\npublic interest shall warrant it.” See, e.g., H.R. Con. Res. 361, 108th\nCong. (2004). That potential for reassembly by itself does not deprive an\nextended Senate absence of its character as a recess. In fact, the Senate\nhad adjourned pursuant to such a resolution before the intrasession recess\nduring which Judge Pryor was appointed to the Eleventh Circuit. That\nrecess appointment was approved by this Office, see Goldsmith Memorandum, and upheld by the court of appeals en banc, see Evans v. Stephens, 387 F.3d 1220. Fourth, legal precedent addressing the President’s authority to pocket\nveto during a recess a bill passed by Congress conceivably might be\nviewed as constraining the President’s recess appointment authority in the\ncurrent recess. For example, in Wright v. United States, 302 U.S. 583, the\nSupreme Court held that a temporary adjournment of the Senate (for\nwhich consent of the House was not required under Article I, Section 5,\nClause 4 of the Constitution) did not prevent the President from vetoing a\nbill. And in Kennedy v. Sampson, 511 F.2d 430 (D.C. Cir. 1974), the D.C.\nCircuit extended Wright to reach all intrasession adjournments, provided\nthat arrangements were made for the receipt of presidential messages. 28 It\ncould be argued that these cases either delineate the types of Senate adjournments that are insufficient to qualify as a “Recess of the Senate”\nunder the Recess Appointments Clause, or establish that the Senate can\ntake some action short of actually remaining in session to mitigate the\nconsequences of its absence. We have previously observed that “[w]hile the Pocket Veto and Recess\nAppointments Clauses deal with similar situations, that is, the President’s\npowers while Congress or the Senate is not in session, their language, effects, and purposes are by no means identical.” Recess Appointments Issues,\n6 Op. O.L.C. 585, 589 (1982). And “[i]n light of the[se] differen[ces] . . . we\ndo not believe [that Sampson] should be read as having any significant\nIn Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21, 41 (D.C. Cir. 1985), the court held that the President is not “prevent[ed]” from returning a bill even during an intersession recess if a duly\nauthorized officer of the originating house is available to receive it. That decision was\nlater vacated as moot. See Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361 (1987). 28 46 Recess Appointments Amid Pro Forma Senate Sessions bearing on the proper interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause.” Id.\nat 590.

Moreover, we have concluded that “there are sound reasons to believe that the President has authority to make recess appointments in situations in which a pocket veto might well be inappropriate.” The Pocket Veto:\nHistorical Practice and Judicial Precedent, 6 Op. O.L.C. 134, 149 (1982). The Pocket Veto Clause “ensures that the President will not be deprived of his constitutional power to veto a bill by reason of an adjournment.” Recess Appointments Issues, 6 Op. O.L.C. at 590. The holdings in\nWright and Sampson—that the President could not pocket veto a bill\nduring an intrasession recess where the Senate had designated an agent to\nreceive the return of a bill—were “bottomed on the theory that [the adjournments at issue] did not ‘prevent’ the return of disapproved bills.” The\nPocket Veto, 6 Op. O.L.C. at 149. Put another way, the designation of an\nagent to receive messages and the pocket veto serve the same purpose,\ni.e., protecting the President’s right to disapprove bills, and therefore\nobviate the need for the power provided by the Clause. The Recess Appointments Clause, however, serves a different purpose. It\n“enables the President to fill vacancies which exist while the Senate is\nunable to give its advice and consent because it is in recess.” Recess Appointments Issues, 6 Op. O.L.C. at 590. The designation of an agent to\nreceive messages neither allows the President to fill vacancies nor makes the\nSenate available to advise and consent. Thus, the President’s ability to make\nappointments during a recess is necessary to further the Recess Appointments Clause’s purpose, while the President’s authority to pocket veto\narguably is not necessary when the presence of a congressional agent allows\nhim to return a bill, exercising his constitutional prerogative to disapprove\nlegislation. While the congressional designation of an agent arguably addresses the constitutional concerns embodied in the President’s pocket veto\nauthority, the periodic convening of pro forma sessions at which no business\nis to be conducted simply does not address the constitutional concerns\narising from the Senate’s unavailability to consider appointments. Finally, we considered whether the Department of Justice has already taken a different view. In arguing that the recess appointment of a member of\nthe National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) did not render moot the\ncontroversy about legal consequences of the absence of a Board quorum, the\nSolicitor General said that “the Senate may act to foreclose [recess appointments] by declining to recess for more than two or three days at a time over\n47 36 Op. O.L.C. 15 (2012) a lengthy period,” using the Senate’s 2007 pro forma sessions as an example. Letter for William K. Suter, Clerk, Supreme Court of the United States,\nfrom Elena Kagan, Solicitor General, Office of the Solicitor General, at 3\n(April 26, 2010), New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB, 130 S.

The letter (like this opinion, see supra note 13) does not answer that\nquestion.
