  "chunk_text": "We suggest that you consider, as an alternative, a statutory\nscheme which would induce, rather than coerce, the states to cooperate\nin making their detention facilities available to the federal government. Congress, by invoking its power under the Spending Clause, could\ncondition the availability of some grant program to individual states on\nthe cooperation of the states in providing detention facilities for federal\npre-trial detainees. Such legislation should, however, be carefully for­\nmulated because the Court has recently reaffirmed its warning that\n“[t]here are limits on the power of Congress to impose conditions on\nthe States pursuant to its Spending Power.” Pennhurst State School and\nH ospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 n. 13 (1981).8 However, if the\nlegislation is not coercive and would contemplate that the states would\nreceive benefits reflecting the incremental costs (including costs attrib­\nutable to administrative and capital costs) of housing the federal detain­\nees in state facilities, the burden and coercive effect on the states should\nnot be considered excessive and such legislation would probably be\nupheld. I would imagine that there are already federal subsidies to state\nprison facilities, and it might be feasible to condition receipt of a\nportion of such subsidies on the willingness to provide facilities (for\ncompensation) for federal pre-trial detainees. If you would like to 8 F or example, statutory inducements cannot be used as “ weapons of coercion, destroying or\nimpairing the autonomy of the states.” Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 586 (1937) 148 consider such an approach, we will be happy to assist further with the\nformulation of such legislation. T h e o d o r e B. O lson Assistant Attorney General\nOffice o f Legal Counsel 149"
