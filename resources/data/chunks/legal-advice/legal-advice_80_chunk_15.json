  "chunk_text": "In contrast to the previous situation, in a closed sales transaction,\nthe b seller has ownership to the proceeds of the b sale to the Coop. There is no\n4 When a member or participating patron receives a per-unit retain, this amount compensates him for a\nportion or all of his b cost of production and delivery to the Coop and part of his profit margin on the\ndelivery of b, if any, depending on the amount of per-unit retain “advanced” to him. Given the theoretical\nideal of a Coop that returns all the gross b proceeds, except for those capitalized by agreement, to its\nmembers/patrons, whether a payment or distribution is characterized as a cost of goods sold, a per unit\nretain representing the member/patron’s cost of goods sold or their profit margin, is irrelevant to the\nCoop’s computation of taxable income. This is because the Coop obtains a deduction or an exclusion\nfrom income, for all cost of goods sold and per-unit retains. Further, to the extent that a patronage\ndistribution is later effected, with respect to the marketing of b, the Coop also gets a patronage dividend\ndeduction. This is true whether this patronage dividend distribution represents a further return of the\nmember/farmer’s cost of goods produced or profit. See I.R.C. §1382(a) and (b).\n5 Although recognizing that per-unit retains and patronage dividends are each provided for individually in\nthe Internal Revenue Code, the equivalence between the two has been judicially recognized. See Farm\nService Cooperative v. Commissioner, 619 F.2d 718, 725, n. 17 (8th Cir. 1980), 1980-1 U.S.T.C. Par.\n9352, rev’g, 70 T.C. 145 (1978). POSTF-143023-10 17 evidence in the instant case, that the members and participating patrons ever intended\nor that they would be amenable to returning any of the b sale proceeds to the Coop, in\nthe event that the Coop’s b sales to third parties failed to equal or exceed the amount of\nper-unit retains paid in money to the members and participating patrons. Therefore, a\nclosed purchase and a per-unit retain are not identical concepts. They are significantly\ndifferent in material ways. If any question remains that a per-unit retain is a unique concept, not identical,\nand quite different from the concept of gross proceeds from completed b sales, and that\nper-unit retains are only those retained pursuant to mutual agreement, a reading of the\nrelevant part of the Senate Report to the Foreign Investors Act of 1966, that provided\nparallel treatment to per-unit retains and patronage dividends, should dispel any\nconfusion. The report, in relevant part, explains, as follows:\n“Although the practices of cooperatives are not uniform …, generally a per-unit\nretain certificate is issued by a cooperative to a patron to reflect the retention by\nthe cooperative of a portion of the proceeds from the marketing of products for\nthe patron. These amounts are retained pursuant to an authorization (usually in\nthe bylaws of the cooperative) and are computed on the basis of units of\nproducts marketed. Prior to the amendments in 1962, the Internal Revenue Code permitted\ncooperatives to deduct amounts paid to patrons as patronage dividends."
