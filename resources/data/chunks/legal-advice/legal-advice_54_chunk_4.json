Howard\nMark H. Howard\nSenior Counsel (Salt Lake City)\n(Small Business/Self-Employed) 1 We point out that the refunded amount, constituting a rebate of the employee’s portion of the tax which\nwas collected by the employer and paid over to the IRS, might also be summarily assessed as retaining\nits character as the employee’s portion of Social Security tax. In this regard, if the taxpayer was not\nrequired to file an income tax return and had not filed an income tax return, the claimed excess Social\nSecurity tax would be claimed as refundable on a Form 843. Nonetheless, where the claim for refund is\nmade on an income tax return, the assessment mechanism that best fits the section 31 characterization is\nsection 6201(a)(3)."
