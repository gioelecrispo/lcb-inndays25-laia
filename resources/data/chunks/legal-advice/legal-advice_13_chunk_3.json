  "chunk_text": "Thus, the CSED has\nexpired for the partnership taxes and the Service cannot collect\nthe liability from either the partnership or the general partners\n(due to their derivative liability for the employment taxes). Pursuant to Galletti, with regard to the civil penalty, because\nthe CSED has not yet expired, the civil penalty is able to be\ncollected from the general partners since they are derivatively\nliable for the assessments against the partnership. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, it is Counselâ€™s opinion that an OIC\nfiled by general partners for their derivative liability for a\npartnership tax liability does not suspend the CSED as to the\npartnership tax liability. Additionally, when the CSED expired\nas to the partnership, it also expired as to the general\npartners, even though the general partners filed an OIC. Regarding the civil penalty for which the CSED has not expired in\nthis case, the general partners are derivatively liable for the\nassessment. page 6 CC:SB:8:LA:3:POSTF-162737-03 At this time, we are closing our file in this matter.
