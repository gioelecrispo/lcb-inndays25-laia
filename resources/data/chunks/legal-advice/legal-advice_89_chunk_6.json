  "chunk_text": "This position also is supported by\nthe language of the agreement that the Commissioner ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Inventory acquired from Company B or Company C is not included on Attachment Y. In addition, a conclusion to the contrary would allow application of the Closing\nAgreement to companies who were not parties to the agreement. A person who is not a\nparty to a contract “is in no position to invoke its protection.” Hagar v. Reclamation Dist.\nNo. 108, 111 U.S. 701, 712-13 (1884). Third parties do not receive rights under a\ncontract unless the contract reflects the express or implied intent of the parties to benefit\nthe third party. See F.D.I.C. v. United States, 342 F.3d 1313, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Generally, closing agreements are only binding with respect to the parties thereto. See\nSchwartz v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1980-212. Although, closing agreements may\nbe binding on transferees. See Pert v. Commissioner, 105 T.C. 370, 376 (1995)\n(transferee of assets from his wife and her former husband’s estate could not challenge\nthe deficiencies and additions to tax that were agreed to by the wife and the estate in a\nclosing agreement when IRS sought to collect from the transferred assets). Company B and Company C were not parties to the agreement and the agreement\ndoes not reflect an intent, express or implied, to include inventory acquired in\nsubsequent mergers, acquisitions, or other corporate transactions within the confines of\nthe Closing Agreement. In fact, the Closing Agreement reflects the opposite intention\nas it provides that the IRS may examine anything entering into inventory after Date 7. expired for those years. Graff Chevrolet v. Campbell, 343 F.2d 568, 572 (5th Cir. 1965); cf. Huffman v.\nCommissioner, 518 F.3d 357 (6th Cir. 2008). Because a section 481(a) adjustment attributable to a\nchange in item definitions would, in part, require a change to the inventory calculation for pre-Year 2 tax\nyears, such adjustment would be in violation of the Closing Agreement. Therefore, any section 481(a)\nadjustment would be limited to tax years after Year 1.\n6\nRev. Rul. 70-565, 1970-2 C.B. 110, holds that the LIFO layers and date bases of the transferor’s LIFO\ninventories carry over in a section 351 transaction to an existing transferee also using the LIFO method. Sections 381(c)(5) provides that an acquiring corporation must compute inventories on the same basis\nused by the distributor or transferor corporation unless different methods were used by the acquiring\ncorporation and the distributor or transferor corporation. If different methods were used and the\nbusinesses are to be integrated, then the principal method must be used. Treas. Reg. § 1.381(c)(5)1(c)(1). POSTF-140663-09 9 While closing agreements may apply to transferees, Company B and Company C are\nnot transferees. To the extent they are transferors, the same rule does not apply. Binding a transferee precludes a taxpayer from avoiding the application of a closing\nagreement by transferring assets. To apply this rule conversely would not achieve the\nsame result; rather it would allow application of a closing agreement to taxpayers and\nitems to which it was never meant to apply.
