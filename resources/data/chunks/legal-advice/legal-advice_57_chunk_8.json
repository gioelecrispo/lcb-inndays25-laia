  "chunk_text": "Pursuant to the FCC Order, the broadcast stations will be provided with\n\"comparable facilities,\" that is, replacement equipment and related installation and other\ncapital costs that will allow the broadcast stations to continue operations on the new and\nnarrower spectrum licensed to them. Under the plan, the cost will be borne initially by\nthe Transition Administrator and ultimately by the FCC / US Treasury. Based on the foregoing, it is Counsel’s opinion that the mandated replacement to\nfacilitate the FCC plan meets the following three requirements: (1) the BAS equipment\nof the broadcast stations are “taken” by a governmental authority as a result of\nrequisition or condemnation (or threat or imminence thereof); (2) the “taking” is for\npublic use; and (3) the replacement equipment is similar or related in service or use to\nthe equipment so converted. Accordingly, the mandated replacements constitute\ninvoluntary conversions pursuant to I.R.C. § 1033(a)(1) for which non-recognition of\ngain is mandatory under Treas. Reg. § 1.1033(a)-2(b). At this time, we are closing our file in this matter. If you have any questions,\nplease contact Attorney Alan H. Cooper at (213) 894-3027 ext. 195. Michael P. Lackner\nAssociate Area Counsel\n(Large and Mid-Size Business) By: _____________________________ ALAN H. COOPER\nAttorney (Los Angeles, Group 2)\n(Large and Mid-Size Business)"
