  "chunk_text": "A panel chair person leads each hearing and receives internal training from\nthe ------ on specifically what needs to be covered at each hearing. These decisions are\nthen entered by the -----------------------and appealable in the state district courts. The ----------members are compensated on a per diem basis, sign in and out of hearings, and\ngenerally work on a seasonal basis. Training is required by the State --------------- for all\nnew members. -------members cannot work for more than one ---------. ------ members\nare limited by statute to --------------------terms, The -------exists by statute. ---------------------Code section -------establishes -----------for\neach------------- district and sets out eligibility requirements, term limits, and removal\nprocedures and grounds, which include dereliction of duty and violation of conflict of\ninterest prohibitions. The --------------------------Manual provides more specific\nprocedures for disciplining and removing appointed members. ---------------------Code\nsection --------sets out restrictions on -------member eligibility. Generally, an individual is\nineligible for -------membership if they are related within a certain degree to ----------------------------------, -------------------------------------, have exceeded term limits, or:\n…is a member of the board of directors, an officer, or employee of the -------------district, an employee of the ---------------, or a member of the governing body,\nofficer, or employee of a --------------. In --------------------, former members of the board of directors, officers, or employees of\nthe ------------ district are also ineligible. Other provisions address other conflict of\ninterest situations, such as interests in contracts and ex parte communications with ------------------- regarding cases before the ------. ---------------------Code -------sets basic\nrequirements for the organizational structure and meetings of the ------ and specifies\nthat compensation to -------members is a per diem set by the ------------ district budget for\neach day and reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses. The -------is required to maintain independence from the ------------ district for purposes\nof the review hearings it conducts and is self-governed within the guidelines established\nby statute and the ----------------. However, the ------ budget is part of the----------------district budget. ------ members serve on three member panels and are paid a set\namount for each day or half day that they serve. The -------members are issued Forms\n1099 using the ---------TIN, the payments are recorded in the -------- accounts payable,\nand the payments are issued from the -------- bank account. All supplies and\nequipment, clerical staff, and legal services needed by the ------ members are paid for\nfrom the ---------budget. 3 For purposes of this analysis we assume that the ------ follows the procedures set out in both the state\nand local level manuals. POSTF-123043-08 5 -------- argues that ------ members cannot be employees of the -------------district because\nof the above quoted language in -------------------- Code § -----------. The -------------------------------------provided an opinion that the language is a “conflict of interest” concern\nrather than a prohibition. You indicated that ---------views an employee as someone\nworking on a permanent, full-time basis. A ----------, 20----letter from---------’s General\nCounsel first contended that the ---------------- has no authority to interpret the -------------------------Code with regard to the operation and management of -------------districts and --------------review boards. The ---------- -------- letter also argued the -------members themselves controlled the\nmaterial details of how they perform their duties."
