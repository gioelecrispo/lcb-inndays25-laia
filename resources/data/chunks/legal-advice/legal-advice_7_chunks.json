CONCLUSION The District Director may grant an extension for the filing of annual certifications and\nannual waivers in compliance with an I.R.C. § 367 gain recognition agreement where\nthe failure to file was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect because a\ntaxpayer: (1) reasonably relied on a qualified tax representative; (2) voluntarily disclosed\nits failure to timely comply with the terms of its gain recognition agreement; and (3)\nthere was no gain triggering disposition of the transferred corporation’s stock within the\nterm of the agreement. FACTS ------------------------------------------is a United States corporation with registered address at\n---------------------------------------------------------. ------- owned common stock in ---------------------------------------------, an ------------- entity. On ---------, -------, ------- contributed ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------shares of ------------ common stock to ----------------------------------------------------- in\nexchange for --------------- shares of -----------------’s common stock. ----------------- is an --------------- company. -------’s ownership interest in ----------------- was approximately ---%\nafter the exchange. On its Federal income tax return (Form 1120) for the taxable year ended --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, -------, ------ included Form 8838, “Consent to Extend the Time to Assess Tax Under\nSection 367 – Gain Recognition Agreement.” On Form 8838, ------ consented to extend\nthe statute of limitation for assessment of tax on the exchange of --------- -----------shares for the --------------- shares of ----------------- stock until ------------------, -------. Also,\nincluded in the tax return was a three-page agreement entitled “Gain Recognition\nAgreement Under Treasury Regulation § 1.367(a)-8.” Paragraph (v) of the Gain POSTU-110020-04 3 Recognition Agreement Under Treasury Regulation § 1.367(a)-8 states, “the transferor\nwill file a certification statement with its tax return for each of the five years subsequent\nto the year of the filing of this agreement.” This gain recognition agreement was signed\nunder the penalties of perjury by -------’s President. ------ sold ----------- common shares of ---------------- in --------------- of ------- and reported\n$----------- gain from the sale on its ------ Federal income tax return.

      "content": "------’s representative, ----------------------------------, notified the Internal Revenue Service\nin a telephone conversation on ---------------, ------- that ------- failed to comply with the\ngain recognition agreement regulations. -------sent a letter dated ------------------, ------stated that ------- had “inadvertently failed to file annual certifications under IRC § 367(a)\nfor each of its taxable years -------, ------, -------, and -------.” Enclosed in the letter were\nannual certifications for taxable years -------, -------, -------, and -------, signed under\npenalties of perjury by -------’s President and dated ---------------, -------. ------ has only\nfiled one waiver to the statute of limitations to date, the Form 8838, “Consent to Extend\nthe Time to Assess Tax Under Section 367 – Gain Recognition Agreement” originally\nfiled with its ------- Federal income tax return. ------- claims it relied on ------ to properly\nprepare its Federal income tax returns for taxable years ------- through ------. This\nreliance resulted in ------’s inadvertent failure to file annual certifications and annual\nwaivers. ------ requested that the Internal Revenue Service accept each late filed\nannual certifications as timely filed because it had reasonable cause for the failure to file\ndue to its reliance and ------. ------ claims it also has reasonable cause for failing to file\nannual waivers. To date, ------- has not filed any of the annual waivers for taxable years\n------- through -------. ISSUE\nCan the District Director provide an extension of time for the filing of annual waivers and\nannual certifications required to be filed in connection with an I.R.C. § 367 gain\nrecognition agreement when a taxpayer has good cause for its failure to timely file? LAW AND ANALYSIS For the tax year at issue (------), Treas. Reg. § 1.367(a)-3T(g)(1) provides that a transfer\nof stock will not be subject to section 367(a)(1) of the Code if (1) the transferor complies\nwith the reporting requirements of section 6038B and any regulations thereunder; and\n(2) the transferor files an agreement to recognize gain if the transferee corporation\ndisposes of the stock at a later date. In filing a gain recognition agreement,\nthe transferor must agree to file with its income tax return for each of the five taxable\nyears following the taxable year of the transfer a certification that the stock or securities POSTU-110020-04 4 transferred have not been disposed by the transferee in a transaction that is considered\nto be a disposition. Treas. Reg. § 1.367(a)-3T(g)(5)(i). The transferor also must agree\nto file with its income tax return for each of the eight taxable years following the year of\ntransfer a waiver of the period of limitations on assessment. Treas. Reg. § 1.367(a)3T(g)(5)(ii). A gain recognition agreement must be attached to, and filed by, the due date of, the\ninformation return required under section 6038B of the Code (Form 926). § 1.6038B1T(b)(1). Form 926 must be filed with the transferor's tax return for the taxable year that\nincludes the date of the transfer. See Temp. Reg. §§ 1.367(a)-3T(g)(2) and 1.6038B1T(b)(1). Certain penalties apply if a taxpayer fails to comply with the reporting\nrequirements of section 6038B of the Code and the regulations thereunder."

Certain penalties apply if a taxpayer fails to comply with the reporting\nrequirements of section 6038B of the Code and the regulations thereunder. A failure to\ncomply with the section 6038B requirements includes a failure to report at the proper\ntime and in the proper manner any required material information. Temp. Reg.\n§ 1.6038B-1T(f)(1) and (2). Temp. Reg. § 1.6038B-1T(f)(3) provides that the penalties provided in § 1.6038B1T(f)(1) will not apply if a transferor shows that a failure to comply with the reporting\nrequirements was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. The determination of\nwhether a failure to file in a timely manner, or materially comply, was due to reasonable\ncause shall be determined by the District Director under all the facts and circumstances. Temp. Reg. § 1.6038B-1T(f)(3). A transferor may do so by providing a written\nstatement to the District Director having jurisdiction of the taxpayer's return for the year\nof the transfer, setting forth the reasons for the failure to comply. Whether a failure to\ncomply was due to reasonable cause is determined by the District Director under all the\nfacts and circumstances. While the regulations under I.R.C. § 6038B specifically refer\nto the filing of the initial gain recognition agreement (on Form 926), we believe that\nTemp. Reg. § 1.6038B-1T(f)(1) extends to all subsequent required filings with respect to\nthe gain recognition agreement. If the District Director determines ------ failed to file the annual waivers and annual\ncertifications in connection with the filing of its gain recognition agreement, ------- will be\nrequired to recognize gain and pay a penalty under section 6038B, unless the District\nDirector permits an extension to file the annual waivers and annual certifications on the\ngrounds that -------’s failure to timely file was due to reasonable cause and not willful\nneglect. See Treas. Reg. § 1.6038B-1T(f)(3). Where a taxpayer (1) relies on its qualified representative; (2) voluntarily disclosed its\nfailure to comply with the terms of a gain recognition agreement; and (3) there was no\ngain triggering disposition of the transferred corporation’s stock within the term of the\nagreement, the District Director may reasonably conclude the taxpayer’s failure to timely\nfile annual waivers and annual certifications are due to reasonable cause and not willful\nneglect and permit an extension for filing. ------- relied on ------, one of the big four\naccounting firms. ------ failed to properly complete ------’s Federal income tax returns for\nthe ------ thorough ------- taxable years. ------- voluntarily notified the Internal Revenue\nService it failed to timely file annual waivers and annual certifications. For these POSTU-110020-04 5 reasons we find that the District Director may reasonably conclude ------- has\nreasonable cause for its failure to timely file the annual waivers and annual certifications\nfor the ------- through ------ taxable years and -------’s failure was not caused by willful\nneglect. Therefore, the District Director may grant an extension for the filing of the\nannual waivers and annual certifications."

If the District Director provides an extension, the annual certifications already provided\nto the Internal Revenue Service will be accepted as timely filed. However, ------ has not\nsubmitted any annual waivers to date. If ------- fails to submit annual waivers for taxable\nyears ------- through ------- within the time allotted by the District Director, ------- will be\nrequired to recognize gain and pay a penalty per Treas. Reg. §§ 1.6038B-1T(f)(1)(i) and\n(ii). CONCLUSION The District Director may grant an extension for the filing of annual certifications and\nannual waivers in compliance with an I.R.C. § 367 gain recognition agreement where\nthe failure to file was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect because a\ntaxpayer: (1) reasonably relied on a qualified tax representative; (2) voluntarily disclosed\nits failure to timely comply with the terms of its gain recognition agreement; and (3)\nthere was no gain triggering disposition of the transferred corporation’s stock within the\nterm of the agreement.
