Whether a penalty under section 6662 for negligence or disregard of rules or\nregulations should apply to the underpayment attributable to Taxpayer’s reporting\nof its open-air parking structures as land improvements with 15-year depreciable\nlives, rather than as buildings with 39-year depreciable lives? 2. Whether Taxpayer had reasonable cause and acted in good faith under\nsection 6664, which is a defense to an accuracy-related penalty? CONCLUSIONS 1. There is a legally sufficient basis to apply a penalty for negligence or disregard of\nrules or regulations. The decision of whether to apply the penalty, however, rests\nwith the IRS team manager. 2. Taxpayer has not demonstrated that it has met the reasonable cause and good\nfaith exception to an accuracy-related penalty.

Taxpayer is in the IRS’s Coordinated Issue Case\nprogram (formerly the Controlled Examination Program).

The IRS issued a Coordinated Issue Paper,\nsubsequent to the period(s) that the Taxpayer had established its method\nfor depreciating Parking Structures, advocating that such structures are\nmore appropriately treated as buildings with a depreciable life of 39 years. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Taxpayer believes, as of the time\nthe applicable returns (Form 1120) were filed, it met the reasonable cause\nand good faith exception of IRC § 6664(c) and Reg. § 1.6664-4. 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ POSTF-140035-12 3 Previously Considered Open-Air Parking Structures\nOn ---------------------------, Taxpayer filed Form 3115 - Application for Change in\nAccounting Method, to reclassify the recovery period for depreciation purposes of its\nopen-air parking structures from either 39 or 31.5 years to a 15-year recovery period.

For purposes of depreciation under section 168, the depreciation recovery period is\ngenerally determined by class life. Revenue Procedure 87-56, which sets forth class\nlives and recovery periods of property under section 168, describes the assets included\nas land improvements as:27\nIncludes improvements directly to or added to land, whether such\nimprovements are section 1245 property or section 1250 property,\nprovided such improvements are depreciable."

The term “rules or regulations” includes\nthe provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, temporary or final Treasury\nregulations issued under the Code, and revenue rulings or notices (other\nthan notices of proposed rulemaking) issued by the Internal Revenue\nService and published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. A disregard of\nrules or regulations is “careless” if the taxpayer does not exercise\nreasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return position that\nis contrary to the rule or regulation. A disregard is “reckless” if the taxpayer\nmakes little or no effort to determine whether a rule or regulation exists,\nunder circumstances which demonstrate a substantial deviation from the\nstandard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe. A disregard\nis “intentional” if the taxpayer knows of the rule or regulation that is\ndisregarded. Nevertheless, a taxpayer who takes a position (other\nthan with respect to a reportable transaction, as defined in § 1.6011-4(b) or\n§ 1.6011-4T(b), as applicable) contrary to a revenue ruling or notice has\nnot disregarded the ruling or notice if the contrary position has a\nrealistic possibility of being sustained on the merits. Reasonable Basis\n“Reasonable basis” is defined in the regulations as:33\nReasonable basis is a relatively high standard of tax reporting, that is,\nsignificantly higher than not frivolous or not patently improper. The\nreasonable basis standard is not satisfied by a return position that is merely\narguable or that is merely a colorable claim. If a return position is\nreasonably based on one or more of the authorities set forth in § 1.66624(d)(3)(iii) (taking into account the relevance and persuasiveness of the\nauthorities, and subsequent developments), the return position will\ngenerally satisfy the reasonable basis standard even though it may not\nsatisfy the substantial authority standard as defined in § 1.6662-4(d)(2). (See § 1.6662-4(d)(3)(ii) for rules with respect to relevance,\npersuasiveness, subsequent developments, and the use of a wellreasoned construction of an applicable statutory provision for purposes of\nthe substantial understatement penalty.) In addition, the reasonable cause\nand good faith exception in § 1.6664-4 may provide relief from the penalty\nfor negligence or disregard of rules or regulations, even if a return position\ndoes not satisfy the reasonable basis standard. The authorities upon which a position may be reasonably based are in section 1.666232\n33 Section 1.6662-3(b)(2) (emphasis added). Section 1.6662-3(b)(3). POSTF-140035-12 10"

Conclusions reached in\ntreatises, legal periodicals, legal opinions or opinions rendered by tax\nprofessionals are not authority. The authorities underlying such\nexpressions of opinion where applicable to the facts of a particular case,\nhowever, may give rise to substantial authority for the tax treatment of an\nitem. Notwithstanding the preceding list of authorities, an authority does not\ncontinue to be an authority to the extent it is overruled or modified, implicitly\nor explicitly, by a body with the power to overrule or modify the earlier\nauthority. In the case of court decisions, for example, a district court\nopinion on an issue is not an authority if overruled or reversed by the United\nStates Court of Appeals for such district. However, a Tax Court opinion is\nnot considered to be overruled or modified by a court of appeals to which a\ntaxpayer does not have a right of appeal, unless the Tax Court adopts the\nholding of the court of appeals.

Generally, the most important factor is\nthe extent of the taxpayer’s effort to assess the taxpayer’s proper tax\nliability. Circumstances that may indicate reasonable cause and good faith\ninclude an honest misunderstanding of fact or law that is reasonable in light\nof the all the facts and circumstances, including the experience,\nknowledge, and education of the taxpayer. An isolated computational error\nor transcriptional error generally is not inconsistent with reasonable cause\nand good faith. Reliance on an information return or on the advice of a\nprofessional tax advisor or an appraiser does not necessarily demonstrate\nreasonable cause and good faith. Similarly, reasonable cause and good\nfaith is not necessarily indicated by reliance on facts that, unknown to the\ntaxpayer, are incorrect. Reliance on an information return, professional\nadvice, or other facts, however, constitutes reasonable cause and good\nfaith if, under all the circumstances, such reliance was reasonable and the\ntaxpayer acted in good faith. (See paragraph (c) of this section for certain\nrules relating to reliance on the advice of others.) …. The regulation regarding reliance on opinion or advice states:36\nReliance on opinion or advice – (1) Facts and circumstances;\nminimum requirements. All facts and circumstances must be taken into\naccount in determining whether a taxpayer has reasonably relied in good\nfaith on advice (including the opinion of a professional tax advisor) as to\nthe treatment of the taxpayer (or any entity, plan, or arrangement) under\nFederal tax law. For example, the taxpayer’s education, sophistication\nand business experience will be relevant in determining whether the\ntaxpayer’s reliance on tax advice was reasonable and made in good faith. In no event will a taxpayer be considered to have reasonably relied in\ngood faith on advice (including an opinion) unless the requirements of this\nparagraph (c)(1) are satisfied. The fact that these requirements are\nsatisfied, however, will not necessarily establish that the taxpayer\nreasonably relied on the advice (including the opinion of a tax advisor) in\ngood faith. For example, reliance may not be reasonable or in good faith if\nthe taxpayer knew, or reasonably should have known, that the advisor\nlacked knowledge in the relevant aspects of Federal tax law. 35\n36 Section 1.6664-4(b)(1).\nSection 1.6664-4(c). POSTF-140035-12 12 (i) All facts and circumstances considered. The advice must be\nbased upon all pertinent facts and circumstances and the law as it\nrelates to those facts and circumstances. For example, the advice\nmust take into account the taxpayer’s purposes (and the relative weight\nof such purposes) for entering into a transaction and for structuring a\ntransaction in a particular manner. In addition, the requirements of this\nparagraph (c)(1) are not satisfied if the taxpayer fails to disclose a fact\nthat it knows, or reasonably should know, to be relevant to the proper\ntax treatment of an item. (ii) No unreasonable assumptions.

Advice is any communication, including the opinion\nof a professional tax advisor, setting forth the analysis or conclusion of a\nperson, other than the taxpayer, provided to (or for the benefit of) the\ntaxpayer and on which the taxpayer relies, directly or indirectly, with\nrespect to the imposition of the section 6662 accuracy-related penalty. Advice does not have to be in any particular form. The initial determination of whether a penalty should be imposed must be approved by\nthe immediate supervisor (e.g., the team manager) of the person proposing the\npenalty. 37 ANALYSIS\nPreliminary Comments Regarding Taxpayer’s Protest (Prior Examination) Taxpayer makes the underlying issue more complicated than is required or 37 IRM 20.1.1.2.3 (11-25-2011). POSTF-140035-12 13 appropriate.38 IRS Compliance and Taxpayer agree that Rev. Proc. 87-56 sets forth the\nclass life and recovery period of land improvements, which excludes buildings, as\ndefined in section 1.48-1(e) of the regulations. 39 Thus, the issue requires determining\nwhether the parking structures are buildings under section 1.48-1(e). To have a reasonable basis, Taxpayer’s position must be “reasonably based” on the\napplicable authorities. 40 The authorities must be relevant and must not ignore contrary\nauthorities. 41 Taxpayer advanced numerous arguments as to why it should prevail on\nthe underlying issue and, therefore, why it has a reasonable basis. As explained herein,\nTaxpayer’s arguments are not reasonably based on the applicable law and Taxpayer is\nignoring the language in section 1.48-1(e) and in relevant case law. As a result, at best,\nTaxpayer’s return position is merely arguable or merely a colorable claim. Therefore,\nTaxpayer does not have a reasonable basis for its return position. Argument 1: Reasonable Basis based on Protest Arguments\nTaxpayer raised several arguments in the protest of its prior IRS examination (----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------) to support its position that a parking garage is a land improvement which\nhas a 15-year life, rather than a building, which has a 39-year life, for purposes of\ndepreciation. Taxpayer’s arguments are (or appear to be):\n(A) Treasury Regulation section 1.48-1(e) is invalid because it added the words\n“parking” and “garage,” where as the legislative history to the investment tax\ncredit did not include those words. 42\n(B) The parking structures do not appear as buildings. They do not have floor-toceiling walls, a conventional roof, and they do not share supporting structural\nelements. 43 38"

The term includes, for\nexample, structures such as apartment houses, factory and office buildings,\nwarehouses, barns, garages, railway or bus stations, and stores.” (Emphasis added.) Use of the word “or” means that the items in the series are disjunctive:58 if the purpose\nis any one of the functions listed, the functional test is satisfied.

The quantum of employee activity is, in our opinion,\ncritical in determining whether the function of a given\nstructure is principally, or only incidentally, to provide work\nspace. Yellow Freight, 538 F.2d at 797 n.11 (citations omitted). Footnote 11, discussing the amount of human activity carried on, was in\nresponse to a case in which the Ninth Circuit held that the nature of\nhuman activity was relevant to the definition of “building,” but the amount\nof human activity was not. See Thirup v. Commissioner, 508 F.2d 915,\n919 (9th Cir. 1974), rev’g 59 T.C. 122 (1972). Although this footnote may lend some support for the Tax Court’s\napplication of the function test, the holding of Yellow Freight does not. In\nYellow Frieght, this Court held that loading docks and inspection lanes\nconstituted “buildings” because the property provided “shelter and work\nspace so that the men and equipment can perform their functions.” Id. at\n796. This Court did not hold that only structures providing working space\nfor humans constitute “buildings.” The issue in Thirup v.

We find the distinction based on the amount of human activity\nunpersuasive. The proper inquiry, which goes to the nature of the\nemployee activity inside the structures, is “whether the structures provide\nworking space for employees that is more than merely incidental to the\nprincipal function or use of the structure.” Brown-Forman Distillers Corp.\nv.

In Satrum, supra, employees worked in aisles between the rows of\nchicken cages inside the structures to collect eggs, feed chickens, and\nremove droppings. Workers also spent long periods of time inside the\nstructures removing thousands of chickens that were to be sent to market\nand replacing those chickens with younger birds. The Tax Court\ncharacterized these activities as “merely supporting of, and ancillary to,”\nthe purpose of the chickens and expressly found the structures did not\nprovide working space. 62 T.C. at 417. In our judgment, the activities of\nthe Thirups’ greenhouses employees were, without a doubt, of the same\nsupportive and ancillary nature as the activities of the workers in Satrum. That flowers may require more human care than chickens is not a\nsufficient reason for deciding that greenhouses are “buildings” while\nchicken coops are not. We conclude that under the functional test, the Thirups’ greenhouses do\nnot function as “buildings,” as that term is employed in section 48. The\ngreenhouses supply the controlled environment that is essential to the\ncommercial production of more and finer cut flowers, a function neither\nenumerated in Treasury Regulation 1.48-1(e)(1) nor sufficiently similar to\nthe enumerated functions to be within their scope."

POSTF-140035-12 21 court [a decision by the 9th Circuit] found ‘unpersuasive’ the distinction between\nbuildings and other structures based on the amount of human activity in the same\nstructures.”74 These cases further support that Taxpayer incorrectly stated that the 9th\nCircuit applies a non-literal interpretation of section 1.48-1(e). In a third case decided by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Tamura v. U.S.,75\nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit did not consider human activity at all in its\nconclusion that an onion-storage shed was a building. The 9th Circuit concluded that\nthe onion shed was a building because it “functions more like a barn, warehouse, or\ngarage (‘building[s]’) than it does as a storage tank, silo, or coke oven (not ‘building[s]’). See Treas. Reg. § 1.48-1(e)(1). No matter how you look at it, inside out, upside down,\nfrom the east or west, north or south, the structure, even in common parlance, is a\nbuilding. ”76\nTaxpayer cited no (accurate) authority for its proposition that the Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit applies a non-literal interpretation of section 1.48-1(e). As discussed\nherein, the case law reflects that the authority states the contrary: the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit interprets the language in section 1.48-1(e) literally. Misreading\ncases does not provide Taxpayer with reasonable basis.77 Protest Argument F – Parking Structure is Not a Garage\nTaxpayer acknowledges that an example of a building in section 1.48-1(e) includes a\ngarage, but states that “garage” is not defined in the regulation or in case law because it\n“has a commonly accepted definition.”78 That definition, Taxpayer states, “is a fully\nenclosed structure that protects vehicles from the elements, theft, and vandalism. ”79\n74 Consolidated Freightways, Inc. v. Commissioner, 708 F.2d at 1388. Tamura v. U.S., 734 F.2d 470 (9th Cir. 1984). 76\nTamura v. U.S., 734 F.2d at 472-473. Moreover, we note that in Illinois Cereal Mills, Inc. v.\nCommissioner, T.C.

Contrary to\nTaxpayer’s definition, Merriam-Webster defines a garage simply as “a shelter or repair\nshop for automotive vehicles. ”80\nTaxpayer concludes that its parking structures provide only limited protection from the\nelements and, because they provide unrestricted access, they provide no protection\nfrom thieves and vandals. Therefore, Taxpayer concludes, the parking structures\naddressed in the underlying issue are not garages. 81 Taxpayer’s argument is without\nmerit. First, Taxpayer refers to its parking structures as garages. 82 Second, to a varying\nextent, Taxpayer’s parking structures provide protection from the elements. Third,\nTaxpayer’s parking structures provide security. As support for Taxpayer’s conclusion, Taxpayer cites McManus v. U.S., 863 F.2d 491\n(7th Cir. 1988). This case regards a hangar structure for airplanes and concludes that it\nis a building. In that case, the court stated “the hangar structure protects airplanes from\nnature and unwanted visitors. It functions as a warehouse or garage….”83 First, the\nMcManus opinion does not conclude that protection from nature and unwanted\nelements is a necessary requirement to be a garage. Even if it had, however, as\nmentioned previously, Taxpayer’s parking structures meet these requirements. Therefore, this argument is without merit and does not provide Taxpayer with\nreasonable basis."

Argument 2: Reasonable Basis based on Prior Appeals Settlement\nTaxpayer states that it has reasonable basis because:84\nthe Appeals team leader affirmatively stated the Company’s [Taxpayer’s]\nposition was deserving of merit and settled (including the issuance of a\nclosing agreement) [regarding] the exact same issue in a previous exam\ncycle, based on hazards of litigation and in spite of the existence of the\nopen air parking structure CIP, further supports the technical merits of our\nanalysis and validates the position as having reasonable basis. 80 http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/garage.

During the meeting on ----------------------------, ----------------------------------------------------------------- clarified that, because Taxpayer convinced IRS Appeals to concede ----% of the issue,\nTaxpayer equates that to reasonable basis. This clarification adds no new dimension to the analysis. 81 POSTF-140035-12 23 Whether a taxpayer has a reasonable basis under section 1.6662-3(b)(3) is determined\nfrom the list of authorities in section 1.6662-4(d)(3)(iii). Opinions rendered by tax\nprofessionals are explicitly excluded from this list. Therefore, the opinion of an\nIRS Appeal’s officer of the merits of the issue is not “authority” upon which reasonable\nbasis can be determined and does not provide Taxpayer with reasonable basis.85 Argument 3: No Disregard of Regulation Because Researched Position Taken on\nReturn\nTaxpayer states that it did not disregard the rules or regulations because it “was clearly\naware of the regulation, did not disregard such regulation, and performed a substantial\namount of due diligence, as evidenced by the protest memorandums attached below, in\nsupporting the position taken on the return. ”86\n“Disregard” includes any careless, reckless or intentional disregard of rules or\nregulations. 87 The phrase “rules or regulations” includes the provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code, temporary or final Treasury regulations issued under the\nCode, and revenue rulings or notices (other than notices of proposed rulemaking)\nissued by the Internal Revenue Service and published in the Internal Revenue\nBulletin.88 A disregard of rules or regulations is “careless” if the taxpayer does not\nexercise reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return position\nthat is contrary to the rule or regulation. 89 A disregard is “intentional” if the\ntaxpayer knows of the rule or regulation that is disregarded.90 A taxpayer who\ntakes a position contrary to a revenue ruling or notice has not disregarded the\nruling or notice if the contrary position has a realistic possibility of being sustained\non its merits. 91 While Taxpayer researched the issue prior to reporting the\nposition on its tax return, its analysis misreads the regulation and the case law\ninterpreting the regulation. Given Taxpayer’s knowledge, sophistication, and\nexperience, Taxpayer’s analysis of the applicable authorities reflects that\nTaxpayer’s efforts did not reflect an attempt to determine its correct tax liability. As discussed in this memo and in the Form 886-A explaining the underlying issue,\nTaxpayer does not have a realistic possibility of being sustained on the merits.

The\ncost segregation study contains no analysis of the facts regarding the parking structures\nat issue – only conclusions in a spread sheet.

Rather, the memo is a “summary discussion.”104 The\nmemo states that it is limited to “the described facts,” but none of Taxpayer’s facts are\nprovided or analyzed. 105 Further, the memo states that it is “not intended to be a formal\nopinion of tax consequences, and, thus, may not contain a full description of all the facts\nor a complete exposition and analysis of all relevant tax authorities. ”106 In fact, the\nmemo omits many relevant tax authorities that provide contrary analysis. The memo\nstates that it “is not binding on the IRS or the courts and should not be considered a\nrepresentation, warranty, or guarantee that the IRS or the courts will concur with our\nconclusions. ”107\nThe memo suggests classifying parking structures as land improvements, concluding\nthat a parking structure (generally) does not meet the definition of a “building.” ----------------------- suggestion is notwithstanding the discussion in the memo of the “function test”\nin section 1.48-1(e), which states that a structure is a building if a purpose is, for\nexample, to provide parking. 108 The memo acknowledges that in most cases, a parking\nstructure will meet the “function test since parking is one of the enumerated purposes in\nthe regulation,” but then states that the appearance test is the “decisive factor” because\na parking structure does not have walls or a roof, is open to the elements, and is not\ndesigned to provide shelter. 109 The memo contains no discussion of the numerous\ncases that elevate the function test over the appearance test, or of the cases that have\ndisregarded the argument that “walls” are necessary under the appearance test.
