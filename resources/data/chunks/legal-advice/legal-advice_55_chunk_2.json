  "chunk_text": "For tax purposes, Taxpayer accrues the entire annual fee for rights to telecast a\nseason’s games in the year the games are played and most of the installments are due,\neven though some installments are not due until the subsequent year. POSTF-118789-08 3 LAW\nSection 461(a) provides that the amount of any deduction or credit must be taken for the\ntaxable year that is the proper taxable year under the method of accounting used by the\ntaxpayer in computing taxable income. Section 1.461-1(a)(2)(i) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that, under an accrual\nmethod of accounting, a liability is incurred, and is generally taken into account for\nfederal income tax purposes, in the taxable year in which (1) all the events have\noccurred that establish the fact of the liability, (2) the amount of the liability can be\ndetermined with reasonable accuracy, and (3) economic performance has occurred with\nrespect to the liability (the \"all events test\"). See also § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(A). The first prong of the all events test requires that all the events have occurred that\nestablish the fact of the liability. Therefore, it is fundamental to the all events test that\nalthough expenses may be deductible before they become due and payable, liability\nfirst must be firmly established. United States v. General Dynamics Corp., 481 U.S. 239,\n243-4 (1987). Generally, under § 1.461-1(a)(2), all the events have occurred that establish the fact of\nthe liability when (1) the event fixing the liability, whether that be the required\nperformance or other event, occurs, or (2) payment therefore is due, whichever\nhappens earliest. Rev. Rul. 80-230, 1980-2 C.B. 169; Rev. Rul. 79- 410, 1979-2 C.B.\n231, amplified by Rev Rul. 2003-90, 2003-2 C.B. 353. The terms of a contract are\nrelevant in determining the events that establish the fact of a taxpayer's liability. See,\ne.g., Decision, Inc. v. Commissioner, 47 T.C. 58 (1966), acq., 1967-2 C.B. 2.\nSection 461(h) and § 1.461-4 provide that, for purposes of determining whether an\naccrual basis taxpayer can treat the amount of any liability as incurred, the all events\ntest is not treated as met any earlier than the taxable year in which economic\nperformance occurs with respect to the liability. Section 1.461-4(d)(2) provides that if a liability of a taxpayer arises out of the providing\nof services or property to the taxpayer by another person, economic performance\noccurs as the services or property is provided. Section 1.461-4(d)(3) provides that if a liability of a taxpayer arises out of the use of\nproperty by the taxpayer, economic performance occurs ratably over the period of time\nthe taxpayer is entitled to the use of the property. ANALYSIS The all-events test is met, with respect to Taxpayer's liability for an annual fee for rights\nto telecast Sport 1 or Sport 2 games, in the year the games are played and the initial\ninstallment payments are due. The fact that final installment payments may be due in a\nsubsequent year does not prevent accrual in the year the games are played since POSTF-118789-08 4 Taxpayer’s liability is fixed by the earlier of performance or payment being due. See\nRev. Rul. 80-230; Rev. Rul. 79-410."
