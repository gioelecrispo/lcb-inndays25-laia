  "chunk_text": "Treas. Reg. § 1.263A-2(a)(3) requires that indirect production\ncosts properly allocable to property produced be capitalized. Treas. Reg. § 1.263A1(e)(3)(i) provides that indirect costs are properly allocable to property produced when\nthe costs directly benefit or are incurred by reason of the performance of production\nactivities. Treas. Reg. § 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii) provides examples of indirect costs that must\nbe capitalized to the extent they are properly allocable to property produced. Treas. Reg. § 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii)(U) provides, as one of example of indirect costs that must be\ncapitalized, the otherwise deductible portion (e.g., amortization) of the initial fees\nincurred to obtain a license or franchise and any minimum annual payments and\nroyalties that are incurred by a licensee or a franchisee. Corporation X’s drugs would not be produced if they could not be marketed and sold. Thus, the ANDA and the licenses directly benefit, and/or were obtained to enable, the\nproduction of the drugs and the annual cost recovery (e.g., amortization) is an indirect\ncost that is properly allocable to the drugs that Corporation X produces and must be\ncapitalized. Treas. Reg. § 1.263A-1(e)(3)(i). Accordingly, Corporation X’s annual cost\nrecovery for ANDA One and the licenses, which are otherwise deductible, are subject to\nthe uniform capitalization rules of § 263A. In closing, it is pointed out that the September 14, 2011 Memorandum concluded that\nthe attorney fees incurred to investigate listed patents and to defend actions for patent\ninfringement for submitting ANDAs to market and sell generic drugs before the\nexpiration of the listed patents must be capitalized under § 263 for the reasons stated in\nthe September 14, 2011 Memorandum. This memorandum reaches conclusions as to\nthe cost recovery of the capitalized attorney fees, separate and apart from the reasons\nfor capitalization under § 263.
