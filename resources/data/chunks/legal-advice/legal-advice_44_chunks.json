Whether the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is bound by the settlement allocation of\npayment per the class action lawsuits involving ----------------------------------? 2. If the IRS is not bound by the settlement allocation, can it convert penalty payments to\nwages, thus subject to employment taxes? CONCLUSION\n1. Based upon the facts provided, the IRS is not bound by the settlement allocation of payment\nper the class action lawsuits involving ---------------------------------2. Based upon the facts provided, the IRS can likely convert both portions of settlement\nallocated penalty payments and interest payments to wages per the class action lawsuits\ninvolving ---------------------------------FACTS -----------------------------------------------is a large company-owned and operated -----------------company with approximately $--------------in sales and through subsidiaries, employs\napproximately ------------employees. ---------- is headquartered in ----------------------, and the\ncompany’s owned and operated --------------chains include ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- and ----------------. -----------is a\nCompliance Assurance Process (CAP) taxpayer for the fiscal years ending -------------, ------------------, and -------------. The lawsuits that resulted in the settlement agreements in question in this case were filed in ---------------of -------. The underlying disputes were between -------------------Managers (excluding\ngeneral managers) and ------------------, and between --------------------------------Managers, ----------Managers, and ------------Managers and ----------------. Neither the Revenue Agent’s Report\n(RAR) nor the administrative file contained much information regarding these lawsuits. Therefore the facts regarding the cases were gleaned from the settlement agreements provided\nby the taxpayer. The claims made by the managers included the following: (1) recovery of -----------------------pursuant to -------------------------------------------------------------; (2) restitution of -------------------- under ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; (3) ------------------ penalties under ----------------------------------------------; (4) penalties for failure to provide ------------------------------------------pursuant to ----------------------------------------------; (5) penalties for\nalleged failure to provide ------------------------------under --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; and (6)\nattorneys fees and costs."

In -------------of ------, the parties met with a well-known wage and hour\nclass action mediator and the settlement agreements in question were the result of that\nmediation. There are two settlement agreements involved in this case; one between managers and ------------------- and one between managers and ----------------. Both of the settlement agreements\nspecify that neither ------------------nor -----------------admit to any wrongdoing by entering into the\nagreements. The agreements provide for a claims process requiring payment of settlement\nawards on a claims-made basis according to a specified formula on each timely and valid claim\nsubmitted. Each of the settlement agreements allocated the settlement awards as follows: ------ POSTF---------------- 3 allocated to alleged unpaid wages for which IRS Forms W-2 will issue; -----allocated to interest\nfor which IRS Forms 1099 will issue; and -----allocated to alleged civil penalties for which IRS\nForms 1099 will issue. The methodology for determining the -----allocations was not given\nanywhere in the settlement agreements. The Revenue Agent sent Form 4564 Information Document Request (IDR) on ----------------------, requesting information pertaining to any payments to settle claims or suits filed against -----------during the calendar years ending ---------------------------and ---------------------------. The taxpayer\nprovided a limited response to the IDR on ------------------, consisting of a one page spreadsheet\ntitled “Settlement Summary” and copies of selected settlement agreements. A second IDR was issued on ------------------, requesting additional documentation pertaining to\nthe settlement agreements accompanying case number ----------------. The taxpayer responded\nto the second IDR on ----------------------, and provided its settlement fund’s EIN, copies of the\npayment checks reflecting the gross amount received into wages, copies of W-2s and Form\n1099s that were issued, and a summary of settlement payment allocations and applicable tax\nwithholdings. The taxpayer supplemented its response on ---------------------------, by sending a\nreconciliation of payments made pursuant to the settlement agreements and the 1096 and W-3\nthat were provided to the taxpayer by its Internal Dispute Resolution Department. Legal Analysis\n1. Based upon the facts provided, the IRS is not bound by the settlement allocation of\npayment per the class action lawsuits involving -----------------------------------A. Authorities\nThe Service is not bound by the allocations contained in settlement agreements to which it was\nnot a party. See Robinson v. Commissioner, 102 T.C. 116 (1994), rev’d in part on other\ngrounds, 70 F.3d 34 (5th Cir. 1995), cert. denied 519 U.S. 824 (1996). The allocation among the\nvarious claims of the settlement can be challenged where the facts and circumstances indicate\nthat the allocation does not reflect the economic substance of the settlement. See Phoenix Coal\nCompany, Inc. v. Commissioner, 231 F.2d 420 (2nd Cir. 1956). The characterization of\nsettlement proceeds cannot depend entirely on the intent of the parties. See Hemelt v. U.S., 122\nF.3d 204 (4th Cir. 1997). In the event of a lump sum payment, the Service will allocate the payment using the best\nevidence available."

      "content": "The characterization of\nsettlement proceeds cannot depend entirely on the intent of the parties. See Hemelt v. U.S., 122\nF.3d 204 (4th Cir. 1997). In the event of a lump sum payment, the Service will allocate the payment using the best\nevidence available. The evidence may consist of the taxpayer’s complaint requesting\nreasonable amounts of damages for each claim. Rev. Rul. 75-230, 1975-1 C.B. 93 and Rev.\nRul. 85-98, 1985-2 C.B. 51 superseding Rev. Rul. 58-418, 1958-2 C.B. 18.\nB. Application to the Taxpayer In this instance, the settlement amounts paid by -----------were not in a lump sum, but rather\nwere allocated in -------- to unpaid wages, interest and civil penalties. As mentioned above,\nallocations may be challenged where the facts and circumstances indicate that the allocation\ndoes not reflect the economic substance of the settlement. The fact that each of the settlement\nagreements allocates the amounts in even --------seems arbitrary, and nothing in the settlement\nagreements states how the allocated amounts were determined. Each of the individual plaintiffs POSTF---------------- 4 who had brought suit in their respective cases sought penalties under the ----------------------Code\nas part of their causes of action. Both the interest amount and the penalty amount should be a\npercentage of the total amount of the back pay awarded for the overtime that was unpaid. The\ncurrent allocation of -----to each category essentially says that the interest and penalty amounts\nequal -----% of the amount of those unpaid wages. It is likely that a portion of the settlement amount may be allocated to both interest and civil\npenalties. However, the current allocations, which also --------the amount allocated to wages,\ncannot be accurate. The taxpayer should show what rate is being used to calculate the total\ninterest amount and the corresponding allocation should be based on that computation. Each of\nthe penalties imposed under the ----------------------Code are based upon the amount of days or\nhours worked by the employee. If in fact, the civil penalty allocation in the settlement agreement\nis meant to represent amounts that would have been awarded under the -------------------- Code\nsections, the taxpayer should show how the allocation amount was calculated. The data\nprovided by the taxpayer does not supply that information with respect to the individual class\nmembers who received settlement payments. The penalties contained in the state --------code\nsections do not provide for a -----% penalty when compared to the unpaid wages, therefore the\ncurrent allocation is not correct. Therefore, we find that the IRS is not bound by allocation\npayments made pursuant to a settlement agreement and, based on the facts presented in the\ncurrent case it is likely that the court would support a reallocation of the settlement payment\namounts for both interest and civil penalties. 2. Based upon the facts provided, the IRS can likely convert both portions of settlement\nallocated penalty payments and interest payments to wages per the class action\nlawsuits involving -----------------------------------A. Authorities\nSettlement payments may be wages subject to employment taxes. If settlement payments are\nconsidered wages, applicable federal employment taxes are imposed and are required to be\nwithheld. I.R.C. § 3402(a)(1). The employment taxes that may apply include FICA, income tax\nwithholding and FUTA."

      "content": "If settlement payments are\nconsidered wages, applicable federal employment taxes are imposed and are required to be\nwithheld. I.R.C. § 3402(a)(1). The employment taxes that may apply include FICA, income tax\nwithholding and FUTA. FICA taxes, income tax withholding and FUTA taxes are imposed on\n“wages” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). For income tax withholding\npurposes, “wages” is broadly defined as “all remuneration for services performed by an\nemployee for his employer,” with specific exceptions. I.R.C. § 3401(a). Sections 3121(a) and\n3306(b) of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Federal Unemployment Tax Act,\nrespectively, define the term “wages”, with certain exceptions not material here, as “all\nremuneration for employment”. Remuneration for employment, unless such remuneration is otherwise excluded, constitutes\nwages even though at the time paid the relationship of employer and employee no longer exists\nbetween the person in whose employ the services were performed and the individual who\nperformed them. Treas. Reg. § 31.3121(a)-1(i). The Supreme Court has made plain that the\nterm “remuneration for employment” is not limited to payments made for work actually\nperformed but includes the entire employer-employee relationship for which compensation is\npaid by the employer to the employee. Social Security Board v. Nierotko, 327 U.S. 358, 365266 (1946). POSTF---------------- 5 Whether an amount received in settlement of a dispute is remuneration for employment and\nsubject to employment tax depends on the nature of the item for which the settlement amount is\na substitute. See Alexander v. Internal Revenue Service, 72 F.3d 938, 942 (1st Cir. 1995) (the\ntest for purposes of determining the character of a settlement payment for tax purposes “is not\nwhether the action was one in tort or contract but rather the question to be asked is ‘in lieu of\nwhat are the damages awarded?’”). Rev. Rul. 72-268, 1972-1 C.B. 313, concluded that certain amounts of unpaid minimum wages\nand unpaid overtime compensation restored by a company to its employees were considered\nwages, but that the liquidated damages paid were not wages, as they represented an additional\npenalty. The Service concluded that, because the liquidated damages were required as a\npenalty for failure to comply with the law, they could not be categorized as wages. The\nprovisions of Rev. Rul. 72-268 have been found not to apply when the taxpayer failed to show\nthe extent to which such allocation to liquidated damages would apply. See 1996 FSA LEXIS\n244. Thus, in the referenced Field Service Advice Memoranda, the Service refused to conclude\nthat a portion of the settlement was entitled to non-wage treatment. B. Application to the Taxpayer The settlement allocation payments allocated to civil penalties in this case included -----of the\ntotal amount. Whether a settlement amount is remuneration for employment and subject to\nemployment tax depends on the nature of the item for which the settlement amount is a\nsubstitute. The amount allocated to civil penalties was likely in lieu of the penalties that would\nhave been imposed due to the violation of --------------------------------------------------------- and -------------- Violation by -----------of these various state code sections was alleged in the various\nclaims by the ---------------managers included in the class action suit."

      "content": "The amount allocated to civil penalties was likely in lieu of the penalties that would\nhave been imposed due to the violation of --------------------------------------------------------- and -------------- Violation by -----------of these various state code sections was alleged in the various\nclaims by the ---------------managers included in the class action suit. We find that the penalties encapsulated in the violation of the various ----------------------Code\nsections may fall under the category of liquidated or punitive damages, as applied in Rev. Rul.\n72-268. The ruling found that, where amounts were required as a penalty for failure to comply\nwith the law, they could not be categorized as wages. In the present situation, the civil penalty\namounts may have been imposed based on the violation of ----------------------Code sections and,\ntherefore, may not be wholly reallocated to wages. Additionally, the settlement agreements\nwere not silent on the amount of the total award that was allocated to the civil penalties, instead\nstating that a third of the total settlement amount was allocated to that category. As such, the\nfacts of 1996 FSA LEXIS 244 are not directly on point with the facts in the present case. However, as mentioned in the prior section regarding whether the IRS is bound by settlement\nallocations, we believe that the -----amount of the settlement payment allocated to civil penalties\nwas not the proper amount. Any portion of that allocation that the taxpayer can show directly\ncorresponded with penalty amounts under the ----------------------Code should be respected as a\nproper allocation. The --------code provisions do not provide for what appears to be a -----%\npenalty calculation in relation to the amount of back wages awarded. As such, the amount of\nthe -----allocation to civil penalties that the taxpayer cannot substantiate could likely be\nconverted to wages, and thus subject to employment taxes. Additionally, while settlement\namounts properly allocated to interest cannot be converted to wages, we do not believe that the\ncurrent allocation of -----to interest is correct. As previously mentioned, the interest amount\nshould be a percentage of the total amount of unpaid wages that are being awarded. Any POSTF---------------- 6 portion of the -----amount that cannot be shown to be properly allocated to interest should also\nbe reallocated to wages, along with the correct portion of the amount allocated to civil penalties. In summary and based on the facts provided, we find that the IRS is not bound by the\nsettlement allocation payments made by -----------pursuant to the settlement agreements made\nwith managers of -------------------and -----------------. Additionally, the allocations that are properly\nshown to result from civil penalties under the ----------------------Code sections may not be\nreallocated to wages if determined to be liquidated damages, but the remaining amount of the ------allocation likely could be reallocated to wages, and thus subject to employment taxes. Please contact the undersigned at ---------------------if you have any further questions.
