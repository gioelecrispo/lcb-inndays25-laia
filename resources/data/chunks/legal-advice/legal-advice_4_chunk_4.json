(Emphasis added)\n2. If a retailer using the retail inventory method selects a price index from\nthe Producer Prices and Price Indexes, the selected index must be\nconverted into a retail price index. Retail price indexes may be derived\nfrom indexes selected from the Producer Price and Price Indexes by\nreference to the changes in the cost complements of the gross margins of\nan individual index category in the same manner as cost price indexes are\nderived in section 3.03 1. POSTF-134426-04 5 ANALYSIS The regulations in effect during the years at issue required manufacturers and certain\nretailers using the dollar-value LIFO method and the IPIC computation method\ndescribed in Treas. Reg. § 1.472-8(e)(3) to convert selected BLS indexes into cost price\nindexes before determining the LIFO value of their dollar-value pools. This conversion\nis necessary because indexes for LIFO purposes are based on the increases in cost,\nwhereas BLS indexes are based on the prices at which items are sold. Specifically, the\nCPI Detailed Report is based on retail sales prices and the PPI Detailed Report is\nbased on manufacturers’ sales prices. Former Treas. Reg. § 1.472-8(e)(3)(iii)(C) requires manufacturers and certain retailers\nto convert selected BLS indexes to cost price indexes before the indexes are used to\ndetermine the LIFO value of the inventory. In Rev. Proc. 84-57, the Service\ndemonstrated how IPIC method taxpayers must convert their BLS indexes to cost price\nindexes. Specifically, section 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 84-57, requires taxpayers to convert\nthe BLS indexes to cost price indexes using the gross profit percentage “determined by\nthe taxpayer for each index category on the basis of its own average for the tax year.” The taxpayer contends it is not required to determine the gross margin based on the\nentire year’s data because Rev. Proc. 84-57 illustrates this requirement by use of a\nretailer, not a manufacturer. The taxpayer misinterprets Rev. Proc. 84-57. Although\nRev. Proc. 84-57 illustrates the requirement that an entire year’s data be used to\nconvert from BLS indexes to cost price indexes using a retailer, its requirements are\nequally applicable to manufacturers. Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 84-57 states that the purpose of the revenue procedure was to\n“provide guidance to taxpayers that elect to use the dollar-value last-in, first-out (LIFO)\ninventory method and the inventory price index computation method described in\nsection 1.472-8(e)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations.” Consequently, the principles\noutlined in Rev. Proc. 84-57 apply to retailers and manufacturers alike. The example involves a retailer that does not use the retail method but that selects\nindexes from the CPI Detailed Report. If this hypothetical retailer used the retail\ninventory method, it would not be required to adjust the CPI indexes because those\nindexes measure inflation in retail selling prices and the retail inventory method is a\nretail selling price-based inventory valuation method."
