  "chunk_text": "A number of revenue rulings and court cases address the use of a NOL incurred by a\nsingle taxpayer in a joint return year. In Calvin et ux v. United States, 354 F. 2d 202\n(10th Cir. 1965), the court of appeals determined that a spouse’s NOL sustained prior to\nmarriage could not be carried over against the other spouse’s income reported on their\njoint return. The court explained that the NOL provisions are personal to the spouse\nincurring the loss and can only offset the income of that taxpayer. Likewise, in Zeeman\nv. United States, 395 F. 2d 861 (2d Cir. 1968), a surviving spouse was not allowed to\ncarryback a NOL incurred after her spouse’s death to taxable years in which she filed\njoint returns with her deceased spouse because the deceased spouse earned all of the\njoint income. In Rev. Rul. 60-216, 1960-1 C.B. 126, a husband and wife resided in a community\nproperty state and filed a joint return for 1954. They divorced in 1955. The husband\nincurred a NOL in 1957 that he was carried back to the 1954 joint return year. The\nrevenue ruling holds that the husband’s NOL may be carried back and applied only\nagainst his share of the community income reported for the carryback year. In Rev. Rul. 80-6, 1980-1 C.B. 295, a divorced taxpayer incurred a NOL that the\ntaxpayer wanted to carryback to a joint return year. The revenue ruling, in amending\nthe rationale set forth in Rev. Rul. 75-368, 1975-2 C.B. 480, explains the procedures for\nthe carryback of a NOL to a joint return as follows: The net operating loss deduction will be carried back and\ncarried over only to the income that would have been\nreported by the taxpayer, if a separate return would have\nbeen filed. The joint rates will be applied to the reduced joint\ntaxable income. The amount of the taxpayer's individual\nrefund will be calculated by determining the taxpayer's\nrecomputed share of the joint liability according to the\nseparate tax formula: taxpayer's recomputed separate tax\nliability [divided by] both spouses' recomputed separate tax\nliability [times] recomputed joint tax liability and subtracting 11\nthat amount from the taxpayer's contribution determined in\naccordance with [Rev. Rul. 80-7, 1980-1 C.B. 296]. The\namount of the overpayment refunded to the taxpayer will be\nlimited to the amount of the joint overpayment. In computing\neach taxpayer's separate tax liability, the tax rates for\nmarried individuals filing separate returns should be used. The following is an example of the manner in which the NOL rules operate when a\nsingle taxpayer incurs a NOL and carries it to a year in which a joint return is filed. The\nexample follows the rules set forth in the above revenue rulings and cases, which\nprovide that a NOL is personal in nature to the taxpayer sustaining the loss and only\navailable in other years to offset the income of the same taxpayer."
