  "chunk_text": "Moreover, since making a\nsection 280C(c)(3) election for the first time on a\nrefund claim is frivolous, there is no “adequate\ndisclosure” defense under sections 6694(a) or 6694(b). • The attempted section 280C(c)(3) election resulted in\nunderstatements of income tax. There is a reasonable cause defense to the section 6694(a)\npenalty (not the section 6694(b) penalty). Preparer would bear\nthe burden of establishing reasonable cause. Given the expertise\nand experience of Preparer\nwith\nthe research credit and the fact that Preparer used actual\nfigures for tax years for which the Taxpayer ultimately submitted\nclaims, we believe it would be extremely difficult for Preparer\nto establish reasonable cause for failing to comply with a simple\nprocedural requirement that is readily apparent from the plain\nlanguage of the Code.
