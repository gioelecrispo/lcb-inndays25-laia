On its original ------- Form 1120-SF, the Trust reported capital gain from\nthe sale of securities. On its ------- Form 1120-SF, the Trust treated losses from the sale\nof securities as ordinary losses and included them in the calculation of its net operating\nloss (NOL). The Trust subsequently amended its ------- Form 1120-SF and\nrecharacterized as ordinary income the amount originally reported as capital gain\nincome. The Trust also claimed a NOL carryback from the taxable year ended -------------------------------------- on its amended ------- Form 1120-SF. This advice has been\ncoordinated with the Associate Office of Chief Counsel, Income Tax & Accounting. This opinion is based on the facts set forth herein. It might change if the facts are\ndetermined to be incorrect. If the facts herein are determined to be incorrect, this\nopinion should not be relied upon. This memorandum should not be cited as precedent. Issues [Type text] 1. Whether the Trust may include ordinary losses from the sale of securities in the\ncalculation of its NOL on its ------- Form 1120-SF. 2. Whether the Trust correctly treated the sales of its securities on its ------- Form 1120SF and its amended ------- Form 1120-SF as producing ordinary losses/income instead\nof capital gains/losses. Conclusions\n1. Treasury Regulation § 1.468B-2(b) does not permit a QSF to deduct any ordinary\nlosses nor does it permit ordinary losses to be included in a NOL of a QSF. Therefore,\nif the Trust treats the sales of its securities as sales producing ordinary losses, it should\nnot include those purported losses in the calculation of its NOL on its ------- Form 1120SF. 2. The Trust should have treated the sales of its securities on its ------- Form 1120-SF\nand its amended ------- Form 1120-SF as producing capital losses/gains instead of\nordinary losses/income. 1\nFacts We understand the relevant facts here to be as follows:\nThe ------------------------------------The Trust was established by order of the U.S. -------------------------------------------------------------------, as a result of a -------------------------------- submitted by ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.2 The Trust assumed the tort liabilities of --------------------------- relating to ------------------------------------------------------------ damage attributable to -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.

The Trust also held investments in/accounts at ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Trust’s position\nAmended ------- Form 1120-SF In summary, the Trust takes the position that:\n1. The Trust is an association taxable as a corporation since it carries on a business\nunder Rev. Rul. 58-442. The Trust further notes that a QSF is subject to I.R.C. § 468B\neven if a QSF is classified as an association for tax purposes. 2. When assets are held for sale in connection with a trade or business and the\nproceeds of such assets are less than the tax basis, there is negative gross income. The Trust cites I.R.C. §§ 468B and 61(a)(1) in support of its position, as well as Davis v.\nUnited States, 87 F.2d 323 (2d Cir. 1937), cert. denied, 301 U.S. 704 (1937). [Type text] 3. Treasury Regulation § 1.468B-2(b) provides that a QSF is allowed a NOL deduction\nto the extent the loss would be deductible in determining the taxable income of a\ncorporation under I.R.C. § 172(a). According to the Trust, that regulation is the only one\napplicable to trade or business losses of an entity taxable as a corporation (other than\nthe possibility that such losses are administrative costs described in Treas. Reg. §\n1.468B-2(b)(2)). 4. The Trust is entitled to the NOL described in I.R.C. § 172(b)(1)(A) unless the election\nunder § 172(b)(1)(H) is made. The Trust claims the amended return reflects such rules. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. The sale or exchange of Trust assets is not a sale or exchange of capital assets. The Trust notes that it is in the business of holding money and securities it is required to\nsell in the ordinary course of its trade or business each time a claimant must be paid. Due to the ----------------------------------------------------, the Trust incurred ---------------losses from the sale of assets ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Accordingly, the Trustees ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The sale of securities was motivated by the Trustees’ determination\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Just as receipt\nof property is a necessary incident to the Trust’s conduct of its business, so was the\ndecision -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. 2. The determination of the Trust’s “modified gross income” depends upon the\naggregate of the Trust’s gross income items from all sources. Such determination of\nmodified gross income considers as one such item a negative amount resulting from the\nfailure to recover the tax basis of assets sold during the taxable year. According to the Trust, gross income is not the same as gross receipts. A fundamental\ntax principle in the calculation of gross income is the recovery of the tax basis of assets. Thus, the manner of the securities’ losses are to be taken into account in calculating the\nTrust’s modified gross income. “Gross income” can be a negative figure when reduced\nby such necessary amounts as the tax basis of assets."

To the extent the Trust has negative modified gross income, the negative modified\ngross income, as adjusted for allowed expenses, is a deductible NOL to the same\nextent as such loss would be allowable to a corporation under I.R.C. § 172(a). The Trust argues that § 172(a) allows corporate taxpayers a deduction for a taxable\nyear in the amount equal to the aggregate of NOL carryovers to such taxable year plus [Type text]\nNOL carrybacks to such taxable year. However, for noncorporate taxpayers, the\namount deductible for capital losses cannot exceed the amount includible as capital\ngains. The Trust contends that the provisions of Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-2(b)(4)\nsupersede the definition of a NOL found in § 172(c). Treasury Regulation § 1.468B2(b)(4) recognizes that incurring business-related losses can result in negative gross\nincome and merits amelioration of the annual accounting impact of such negative\namount provided by the NOL rules. For the Trust, the availability of a NOL to a QSF is\nconsistent with the NOL provisions and the regulations relating to the taxation of a QSF\nthat appear to be to maximize the amounts available to fund claimants. The Trust’s --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In support of these three contentions, the Trust variously cites I.R.C. §§ 468B, 61, 165(f)\nand (g), 1211(a), 1212(a), 172(a), 1(e), and 1001(a), and Treas. Reg. §§ 1.468B-2(a)\nand (b) and § 1.61-6. It also cites a number of court cases in the ---------------------alleged to be pertinent to and supportive of the main issues.

Third, § 1.468B-1(c)(3) provides that the trust must be a trust under\napplicable state law, or its assets must be otherwise segregated from other assets of\nthe transferor (and related persons). The facts here show the Trust meets the three requirements of Treas. Reg. § 1.468B1(c) and therefore is a QSF. First, the Trust was established by court order and is\nsubject to the continuing jurisdiction of the court. Second, per the Trust Agreement, the\nacknowledged purpose of the Trust was to use its assets and/or income to liquidate and\npay ----------------------- claims against --------------------------. Thus, the Trust was\nestablished to resolve or satisfy contested or uncontested claims that have resulted or\nmay result from a related series of events that have occurred and that have given rise to\nat least one claim asserting liability arising out of a tort. Third, the contributed funds are\nphysically segregated from other assets of -------------------------- (and related persons).

Treasury Regulation §\n1.468B-2(b) provides that the modified gross income of a QSF is its gross income, as\ndefined in I.R.C. § 61, computed with certain modifications.

Administrative costs and other incidental expenses\ninclude state and local taxes, legal, accounting, and actuarial fees relating to the\noperation of the QSF, and expenses arising from the notification of claimants and the\nprocessing of their claims. Treasury Regulation § 1.468B-2(b)(3) allows a deduction for losses sustained by a QSF\nfrom the sale, exchange, or worthlessness of property to the extent the losses would be\ndeductible in determining the taxable income of a corporation under I.R.C. §§ 165(f) or\n(g), and under §§ 1211(a) and 1212(a). Section 165(f) provides that losses from sales\nor exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed only to the extent allowed in §§ 1211\nand 1212, and § 165(g) provides rules applicable when securities that are capital assets\nbecome worthless during the taxable year. Section 1211(a) provides that, in the case of\na corporation, losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed only to\nthe extent of gains from sales or exchanges. Section 1212(a) provides, in relevant part,\nthat corporate taxpayers can carry net capital losses back to the three taxable years\npreceding the loss year and then forward to the five taxable years succeeding the loss\nyear. Also, the carryback of a net capital loss cannot increase of produce a NOL (as\ndefined in I.R.C. § 172(c) )for the taxable year to which it is being carried back. I.R.C. §\n1212(a)(1)(A)(ii). Treasury Regulation § 1.468B-2(b)(4) allows a deduction for the amount of a NOL of a\nQSF to the extent the loss would be deductible in determining the taxable income of a\ncorporation under § 172(a). For this purpose, the NOL of a QSF for a taxable year is\nthe amount by which the deductions allowed under §§ 1.468B-2(b)(2) and 1.468B2(b)(3) exceed the gross income of the fund. Ordinary losses that arise from the sale,\nexchange, or worthlessness of property are not deductible under § 1.468B-2(b)(2) or\n(3); as described above, § 1.468B-2(b)(2) allows a deduction for certain administrative\ncosts and other incidental expenses, and § 1.468B-2(b)(3) allows a deduction for [Type text]\ncapital losses.

A NOL has\na longer carryforward period (20 years) than a capital loss carryforward (5 years). On\nthe Trust’s amended ------- Form 1120-SF, it carried back part of the ------- NOL and\naccordingly increased its ------- NOL deduction. As discussed in the preceding section, Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-2(b) does not permit\nordinary losses from the sales of securities to increase a NOL of a QSF. Consequently,\nif the Trust treats the ------- sales of its securities as sales producing ordinary losses, it\nmay not include these sales in its NOL calculation. The Trust’s arguments that ordinary losses can increase a QSF’s NOL are meritless In spite of the plain language of Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-2(b), the Trust asserts that it may\nincrease a NOL by ordinary losses because (1) it could be classified as an association\ntaxable as a corporation and thus allowed a larger NOL under the provisions of I.R.C.\n§ 172 and (2) it has a negative modified gross income that permits the claimed larger\nNOL. With respect to the first argument, Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-1(b) provides in part that: If a fund, account, or trust that is a qualified settlement fund could be classified\nas a trust within the meaning of 301.7701-4 of this chapter, it is classified as a\nqualified settlement fund for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). If a fund, account, or trust, organized as a trust under applicable state law, is a\nqualified settlement fund, and could be classified as either an association (within\nthe meaning of § 301.7701–2 of this chapter) or a partnership (within the\nmeaning of § 301.7701–3 of this chapter), it is classified as a qualified settlement\nfund for all purposes of the Code. Although the Trust admits it is a QSF, it argues that absent this classification, it would\nbe classified as an association taxable as a corporation and therefore entitled to a NOL\ncarryback as claimed on the amended ------- Form 1120-SF. This argument is meritless\n4 As noted previously, the Trust recharacterized the sales of its securities from sales producing capital\ngain to sales producing ordinary income on its ------- amended Form 1120-SF. [Type text]\nunder the plain language of Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-1(b). Additionally, as noted above, if\nan association meets the three requirements of a QSF pursuant to Treas. Reg.\n§ 1.468B-3(c), it is subject to taxation as a QSF under Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-2;\napplication of the QSF rules are not elective. See Preamble to T.D. 8459. Thus, the\nTrust’s argument that it is classified as a QSF but taxed as a corporation is meritless\nunder the plain language of the I.R.C. § 468B regulations and the Preamble to these\nregulations; there is no authority for the Trust’s proposed hybrid classification. The Trust’s second argument is that it has negative modified gross income resulting\nfrom the failure to recover the tax basis of assets sold during the taxable year and that\npermits it to claim a larger NOL under Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-2(b)(4)."

Reg. § 1.468B-2(b)(4). Treasury\nRegulation § 1.468B-2(b) provides that the modified gross income of a QSF is its gross\nincome, as defined in I.R.C. § 61, computed with certain modifications. Section 61(a) provides generally that gross income means all income from whatever\nsource derived, except as otherwise provided in subtitle A. Section 61(a)(3) provides\nthat gross income includes “[g]ains derived from dealings in property.” See also Treas. Reg. § 1.61-6. Internal Revenue Code § 1001(a) provides that the gain from the sale or\nother disposition of property shall be the excess of the amount realized over the\nadjusted basis provided in I.R.C. § 1011, and the loss shall be the excess of the\nadjusted basis over the amount realized. See also Treas. Reg. § 1.1001-1(a). Section\n1001(c) provides that, except as otherwise provided in subtitle A of the Code, the entire\namount of the gain or loss on the sale or exchange of property shall be recognized. As a general matter, I.R.C. § 1 imposes a tax on “taxable income. ” Section 63 provides\nthat the term “taxable income” means gross income minus the deductions allowed\nunder chapter 1 of the Code. One of those deductions is I.R.C. § 165. Section 165(a)\nprovides the general rule that a deduction is allowed for any loss sustained during the\ntaxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. As discussed above,\n§ 165(f) provides that losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed\nonly to the extent allowed in §§ 1211 and 1212, and § 165(g) provides rules applicable\nwhen securities that are capital assets become worthless during the taxable year. It is clear under the plain language of the Code that gross income under § 61(a)(3) is\nnever a negative amount. That section plainly states that gross income includes\n“[g]ains derived from dealings in property.” Also, under the statutory structure of the\nCode, losses from the sale or other disposition of property are accounted for through\ndeductions under § 165, not through negative adjustments under § 61(a)(3). Treasury\nRegulation § 1.468B-2(b)(3) provides for the deduction of only capital losses, which are\nallowed only to the extent of gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets. Ordinary\nlosses that arise from the sale, exchange, or worthlessness of property are not\ndeductible under Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-2(b); thus, ordinary losses are not taken into\naccount in calculating a NOL under Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-2(b)(4). The Trust cites various court cases in support of its argument. However, those cases\nare inapplicable and irrelevant because they do not show that gross income under § [Type text]\n61(a)(3) could ever be a negative amount. For example, in Davis v. United States, 87\nF.2d 323 (2d Cir. 1937), cert. denied, 301 U.S. 704 (1937), the court recognized the\ndistinction between gross receipts and gross income and the items constitutionally\nrequired to reduce gross receipts to gross income."

However, the Second Circuit’s\ndiscussion pertained only to calculating the amount of gross receipts. Similarly, in\nsupport of the proposition that a fundament tax principle in calculating gross income is\nrecovery of an asset’s tax basis, the Trust cites The Pittsburgh Milk Company v.\nCommissioner, 26 T.C. 707 (1956), nonacq., 1959-2 C.B. 8. Once more, this\nfundamental tax principle does not answer the question here. In support of the\nproposition that gross income can be a negative figure when reduced by the tax basis of\nassets, the Trust cites Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189 (1920). The issue before the\nCourt was whether undivided profits in the form of stock dividends extraordinary in\namount were taxable income. Thus, the Court decided a different issue than the issue\nhere. 2. The Trust should have treated the sales of its securities on its ------- Form 1120-SF\nand its amended ------- Form 1120-SF as producing capital losses/gains instead of\nordinary losses/income. As explained above, the Trust treated the sales of its securities as sales producing\ncapital gains/losses on its original Forms 1120-AF for taxable years prior to -------. Starting with its ------- Form 1120-SF, the Trust treated the sales of securities as sales\nproducing ordinary losses/income. The Trust filed an amended ------- Form 1120-SF\nbased on a claimed NOL carryback from -------. It also recharacterized the sales of its\nsecurities during ------- from sales producing capital gain to sales producing ordinary\nincome. As discussed below, we think the sales of the Trust’s securities in ------- and --------- produced capital gains/losses, not ordinary income/losses. Definition of capital asset\nInternal Revenue Code § 1221(a) provides that the term “capital asset” means property\nheld by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with the taxpayer’s trade or business),\nwith the exception of the items listed in §§ 1221(a)(1) through 1221(a)(8). Section\n1221(a)(1) includes stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind that would\nproperly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the\ntaxable year or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the\nordinary course of the taxpayer’s trade or business. 5 The Trust is not engaged in a business 5 Section 1221(a)(2) includes property, used in the taxpayer’s trade or business, of a character that is\nsubject to the allowance for depreciation provided in I.R.C. § 167, or real property used in the taxpayer’s\ntrade or business. This exception clearly cannot apply because the securities are not depreciable or real\nproperty.

Cf. I.R.C. § 7701(a)(26) (the term “trade or business” includes the\nperformance of the functions of a public office). The Supreme Court has stated that to\nbe engaged in a “trade or business” for purposes of I.R.C. § 162 “the taxpayer must be\ninvolved in the activity with continuity and regularity,” and “the taxpayer’s primary\npurpose for engaging in the activity must be for income or profit.” Commissioner v.\nGroetzinger, 480 U.S. 23, 35 (1987). Determining whether a taxpayer is carrying on a\ntrade or business requires an examination of the facts in each case. Id. at 36. It appears that the Trust argues that the activity of being a QSF is in itself a business. However, the Trust Agreement clearly shows that the purposes of the Trust are to: (a)\nassume the --------------------------------------------------------and (b) use the Trust’s assets\nand income to pay holders of valid -------------------------claims. The primary purpose for\nthe Trust’s activity as a QSF is not for income or profit, as required by Groetzinger. Consequently, the Trust is not engaged in a business of being a QSF. Additionally, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that the Trust and ---------------------------are separate\ntaxpayers, and the activities of -------------------------- cannot be attributed to the Trust. See Whipple v. Commissioner, 373 U.S. 193 (1963); Broz v. Commissioner, 137 T.C.\n46, 65-66 (2011) (“The determination of whether an entity is actively engaged in a trade\nor business must be made by viewing the entity in a standalone capacity and not in\nconjunction with other entities.”), aff’d, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 17636 (6th Cir. 2013). It appears that the Trust also argues that it is somehow in a business involving the\npurchase and sale of securities. It is well-settled that a taxpayer who purchases and\nsells securities falls into one of three distinct categories: dealer, trader, or investor. Arberg v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2007-244 (citing King v. Commissioner, 89 T.C.\n445, 457-459 (1987)). A dealer is engaged in the business of buying and selling\nsecurities, and such a business involves sales to customers. King v. Commissioner, 89\nT.C. at 457. Dealers purchase securities with the expectation of realizing a profit not\nbecause of a rise in value, but merely because they have or hope to find a market of\nbuyers who will purchase from them at a price in excess of their cost. Marrin v.\nCommissioner, 147 F.3d 147, 150-152 (2d Cir. 1998). Securities in the hands of\ndealers are excluded from the definition of a capital asset, falling within the exception for\n\"property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of\n[the taxpayer’s] trade or business\" under § 1221(a)(1).

Id. Traders seek\nto profit from short-term market swings and receive income principally from selling on an\nexchange rather than from dividends, interest, or long-term appreciation. King v.\nCommissioner, 89 T.C. at 457-459.

Id. Investors buy and sell securities for their own account,\nbut they are not considered to be in a trade or business no matter how much time or\nresources they expend on the activity. Id. at 459. Their sales produce capital gains and\nlosses. In its response to IDR No. 3, the Trust stated that it did not hold itself out to any third\nparty as a dealer in securities or a trader in securities. Moreover, the Trust has not\nidentified any “customers” to whom it sold securities. Dealers purchase securities with\nthe expectation of realizing a profit not because of a rise in value, but merely because\nthey have or hope to find a market of buyers who will purchase from them at a price in\nexcess of their cost. Marrin v. Commissioner, 147 F.3d at 150-152. The Trust is clearly\nnot engaged in the business of being a dealer in securities. Similarly, the Trust is clearly not engaged in the business of being a trader in securities. Traders seek to profit from short-term market swings and receive income principally\nfrom selling on an exchange rather than from dividends, interest, or long-term\nappreciation. King v. Commissioner, 89 T.C. at 457-459. “In distinguishing a trader\nfrom an investor, courts consider the following nonexclusive factors: (1) The taxpayer's\nintent, (2) the nature of the income to be derived from the activity, and (3) the frequency,\nextent, and regularity of the taxpayer's securities transactions.” Van der Lee v.\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 2011-234, aff’d, 501 Fed. App’x 30 (2d Cir. 2012). The\nTrust did not seek to profit from short-term market swings and receive income\nprincipally from selling on an exchange rather than from dividends, interest, or long-term\nappreciation. Furthermore, even if the Trust were in the business of being a trader, its\nsales of securities would produce capital gains and losses unless it made a mark-tomarket election pursuant to I.R.C. § 475(f), which it did not do. We think the facts clearly show that the Trust was not engaged in any business and that\nit bought and sold the securities as an investor. Therefore, the sales produced capital\ngains and losses."
