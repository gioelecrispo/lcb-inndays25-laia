  "chunk_text": "The gift check sale proceeds do not meet the definition of contributions\nestablished by A’s own documents. For example, A’s by-laws and the Month #, Year\nboard minutes make a distinction between the members’ contributions and other\nincome, which would include “the income (if any) derived from unredeemed Gift\nCertificates.” The ------------------program was established at a later date and represents\na source of “other income,” and not members’ contributions. The “------------------Program” agreement between A and its members was approved in minutes dated\nMonth #, Year, which established the “Program.” The minutes, in part, state: By motion duly made, seconded and then unanimously approved, it was\nresolved that a B’s Program be established for the purpose of selling $X\nand $XX ---------------------to Franchisees and to B customers nationally. Income (if any) derived from unredeemed ---------------------will be used for\nthe not-for-profit purposes of continuing to plan, administer, promote, and\nsupervise a national ,,,,[services],,, program on behalf of the franchisees\nand the franchisor of B and to do all things necessary to carry out these\nprograms. POSTF-149051-10 11 Based on A’s response to IDR##, these minutes were never reduced to a written\nagreement between A and its members. Although the stated purpose of A is a non-profit [special entity] for the members,\nA is still a corporation subject to the general rules of corporate income taxation. -----------------------------are not exempt from federal income taxation, and, in general, are taxed in\nthe same manner as other corporations. Subchapter T allows certain ----------------- that\nare “operating on a ---------------- basis” to exclude certain items from gross income\nthrough a series of special deductions in IRC §§ 1381-1388.4 In effect, the ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------may operate at cost and the “profits” belong to the members, and the ----------------------patrons are taxed on distributions. The only --------------- income that escapes taxation\nat the ---------------- level is patronage source income that flows through to the patrons. To date, A reportedly has not distributed any -------------- dividends to any\nmember, despite having operated as a [special entity] for many years. A has not\nrepresented that the gift check sales are ------------------------- income. But, assuming\narguendo, that they were, A has not flowed through this income to patrons under\nSubchapter T or any other provision. Further, A did not flow through gift check sales\nincome to A’s members within the prescribed time limit under Subchapter T. See I.R.C.\n§§ 1381-1388 requirements to transfer the incidence of taxation to a ----------------’s\npatrons. The fact that A uses the gift check sale proceeds that exceed gift check\nredemptions for… purposes … [that benefit its members]… does not transform the\nsales proceeds to members’ contributions. The members did not sell the gift checks, did\nnot include the proceeds in gross income, and did not contribute the gift check proceeds\nto A for … [service]… purposes. Instead, A sold the gift checks, received the proceeds\nbut failed to include the proceeds in gross income, and did not follow any of the\nSubchapter T provisions, and simply retained the untaxed unredeemed gift check sales\nproceeds, presumptively, for service purposes."
