  "chunk_text": "A ----------, 20----letter from---------’s General\nCounsel first contended that the ---------------- has no authority to interpret the -------------------------Code with regard to the operation and management of -------------districts and --------------review boards. The ---------- -------- letter also argued the -------members themselves controlled the\nmaterial details of how they perform their duties. A large portion of the argument\nfocuses on the statutorily required independence of the ------, as it carries out its quasijudicial functions, from other functions of the ------------ district, such as prohibitions on\nex parte communications. -------- also provided a brief letter from an outside attorney\nstating support for the General Counsel’s opinions and emphasizing the language of ----------------------Code § ----------- by arguing, “It would be improper for the Service to take\na position that is contrary to such a clear expression of legislative intent.” State law does not prevent the -------from being established as a separate entity with its\nown TIN and bank account. The --------------------- manager stated that the State was\nconsidering requiring the -------to “show” independence from the ------------ district by\nobtaining a separate TIN and bank account and admitted that -------members would\nprobably be treated as employees of such a newly created separate entity. You provided a copy of a Medicare-only 218 Agreement entered into for --------between the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the State of ---------which is\neffective on -------------, -------. The agreement states that none of the optional positions\nand services would be excluded. --------- also entered into an agreement, effective on -------------, -------, that eligible employees would be covered by the -------- state\nretirement system. LAW AND DISCUSSION\n1. Public Official Status for Income Tax Withholding Purposes\nI.R.C. § 3401(c) provides that, for income tax withholding purposes, the term\n“employee” includes an officer, employee, or elected official of the United States, a\nState, or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or\nmore of the foregoing. Thus, by federal statute, public officers are specifically included\nwithin the term “employee” for income tax withholding purposes (and conversely are not\n“independent contractors” for income tax withholding purposes). Section 31.3401(c)1(a) of the Employment Tax Regulations clarifies the officers or employees can either\nbe elected or appointed. POSTF-123043-08 6 Whether a state worker is a public officer under section 3401(c) is determined by\nreference to local law. The Code does not define the term “public officer,” but section\n1.1402(c)-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations gives the following examples of persons\nperforming services of a “public office”: the president, the vice president, a governor, a\nmayor, the secretary of state, a member of Congress, a state representative, a county\ncommissioner, a judge, a justice of the peace, a county or city attorney, a marshal, a\nsheriff, a constable, a registrar of deeds, or a notary public. 4 There is, however, a body of case law defining the term “public official.” In Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1975), the Supreme Court stated that anyone who exercises\nsignificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States is an officer. 5 The term\n“officers” embraces all appointed officials exercising responsibility under the public laws\nof the nation.
