  "chunk_text": "See § 1.263A-1(d)(3)(C)(1). In this case, Taxpayer\nspecifically requested permission to change its method of capitalizing storage and\nhandling costs to the variation permitted under § 1.263A-3(d)(3)(iii)(B). This variation\nrequires Taxpayer to multiply the total § 471 costs included in its ending inventory by\nthe storage and handling costs absorption ratio. This is a departure from the general\nrule set forth in § 1.263A-3(d)(3)(i)(C) defining section 471 costs on hand at the end of POSTF-125520-04 4 the year as the LIFO increment, if any, for the current year stated in terms of section\n471 costs. Although not specified in § 1.263A-3(d)(3)(iii)(B), the purchasing costs\nallocable to ending inventory are determined by multiplying the purchasing costs\nabsorption ratio by the LIFO increment for the year, if any. The theory underlying this\nvariation to the simplified resale method is that under the LIFO assumption, beginning\ninventory is stored year after year and should continue to attract storage and handling\ncosts; but such inventory is not purchased again and therefore should not continue\nattracting purchasing costs. The correct application of Treas. Regs. § 1.263A-3(d)(3)(iii)(B) for existing LIFO layers\nrequires the LIFO taxpayer to absorb additional storage and handling costs to these\nlayers. In other words, this method determines the increase in additional section 263A\ncosts from the prior year, not the total additional section 263A storage and handling\ncosts. Section 1.263A-3(d)(3)(iii)(B) does not permit a substitution of rates. Instead it\nrequires storage and handling costs to accumulate for existing LIFO layers. In the\nabove example, the storage and handling costs incurred during Year 2 allocable to the\nYear 2 layer would be $8.25 ($550 X 1.5%) and the storage and handling costs incurred\nduring Year 2 allocable to the base layer would be $15.00 ($1,000 X .5%). Thus, the\ntotal storage and handling costs in ending inventory would be $43.25 ($23.25 ($8.25 +\n$15.00) incurred in Year 2 + $20.00 incurred in Year 1). In summary, the permissible variation under § 1.263A-3(d)(3)(iii)(B) requires that each\nLIFO layer continue to absorb storage and handling costs as long as the inventory\nremains (under a LIFO cost flow assumption) on hand. So a base layer created twelve\nyears prior to Year 2 would accumulate twelve years of storage and handling costs if it\nstill existed in Year 21. CASE DEVELOPMENT, HAZARDS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Section 11.01, Rev. Proc. 97-27, 1997-1 C.B. 680, provides (in pertinent part) the\ndirector of field operations will ascertain if the amount of the § 481(a) adjustment was\nproperly determined and whether the change in method of accounting was implemented\nas proposed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the consent agreement and\nRev. Proc. 97-27. Section 11.02, Rev. Proc. 97-27 provides if the director of field\noperations recommends that the ruling (other than the amount of the § 481(a)\nadjustment) should be modified or revoked, the director will forward the matter to the\nnational office for consideration before any further action is taken. Such a referral to the\n1 We note the Bureau of National Affairs (BNA) Tax Management Portfolio, is consistent with\nour conclusion that the storage and handling costs are cumulative for existing LIFO layers."
