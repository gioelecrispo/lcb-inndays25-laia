  "chunk_text": "Thus, when\na taxpayer receives a payment for goods or services that is includible in the taxpayer’s\ngross income, the taxpayer generally is required to include the payment in income upon\nreceipt, even where the goods or services are to be provided in a future taxable year. See Treas. Reg. §1.451-1(a); Schlude v. Commissioner, supra; American Automobile\nAssn. v. United States, 367 U.S. 687 (1961); Automobile Club of Michigan v.\nCommissioner, 353 U.S. 180 (1957); and Hagen Advertising Displays, Inc. v.\nCommissioner, 407 F.2d 1105 (6th Cir. 1969). The taxpayer in this case avails itself of the deferral method found in Treas. Reg.\n§1.451-5, an exception to the general rule of Treas. Reg. §1.451-1(a), with respect to\n1 Entity B has contracted with a third party, Company C, to render services in the administration of Entity\nB’s gift cards. Company C provides Entity B with the detailed accounting of gift card liabilities,\nredemptions, and outstanding balances. 2 POSTF-142534-093\nthe proceeds from gift cards sold by Entity B. This deferral method applies to “advance\npayments,” which are defined in pertinent part as amounts “received in a taxable year\nby a taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting for purchases and sales…,\npursuant to, and to be applied against, an agreement … [f]or the sale or other\ndisposition in a future taxable year of goods held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to\ncustomers in the ordinary course of his trade or business”. See Treas. Reg. §1.4515(a)(1). The term “agreement” includes a gift certificate that can be redeemed for goods. In this case, Entity B is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, Company A,\nfor federal income tax purposes under the rules described in Treas. Reg. §301.7701-3. If a business entity with only one owner is disregarded, its activities are treated in the\nsame manner as a branch or division of the owner. See Treas. Reg. §301.7701-2(a). Therefore, in this case the sales of gift cards and their redemption are deemed to be\ncarried out by the same taxpayer for purposes of the definition of an advance payment\nin § 1.451-5(a)(1)(i).
