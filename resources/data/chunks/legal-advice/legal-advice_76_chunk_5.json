  "chunk_text": "Thus, a plain reading of 16\nU.S.C. § 796(17) and (18) suggests that a facility could be both a qualified small power\nproduction facility and a qualified cogeneration facility. 3 In fact, the FERC has certified\nnumerous facilities that have satisfied the criteria of both definitions. 4\nCONCLUSION The taxpayer uses Fuel, a type of biomass, for fuel in its power facility. Its facility\nproduces less than 80 megawatts of electricity. The taxpayer’s facility is within the\ndefinition of a small power production facility. The taxpayer self-certified in Year 1 and\ntherefore the small power production facility is qualified. Accordingly, the equipment\nused in the taxpayer’s qualified small power production facility is “5-year property”\npursuant to § 168(e)(3)(B)(vi)(II). Please call LB&I Attorney Signing at Telephone if you have any further\nquestions. Section 6110(k)(3) provides that this memorandum may not be used or cited\nas precedent.
