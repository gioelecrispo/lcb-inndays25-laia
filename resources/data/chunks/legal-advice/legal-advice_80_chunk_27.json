  "chunk_text": "The only evidence of the intention to reclassify is ex post\nfacto and one-sided, namely, the Coop’s claim for refund and the Coop’s unilateral\nOctober 20--- memorandum announcing to its patrons that it is amending its 20----Forms 1099-PATR (among others); Eleventh, the doctrine of election precludes the retroactive re-characterization of the b\npayments. To allow the b purchases to be treated as PURPIMS will be detrimental to\nthe Coop members, patrons, other similarly situated Coops, their member and\nparticipating patrons, and tax administration. Prior to being issued, this opinion was coordinated with -------------------------------(Branch Chief (P&SI) and ----------------------------, Attorney-Advisor (P&SI), who reviewed\nand concurred with the opinion. This concludes our legal opinion. If you have any\nquestions, please contact Lead Industry Counsel (Cooperatives and Agriculture) -----------------------------------, at ---------------------, or Associate Industry Counsel (Cooperatives\nand Agriculture) ----------------------, at --------------------.
