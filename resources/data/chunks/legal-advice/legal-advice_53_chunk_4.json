  "chunk_text": "The settlement document does not explicitly allocate the money into one category or the\nother. However, the Federal statute as well as the State X statute that the suit invoked speak only\nof fines, not of damages. Additionally, the amount that Taxpayer paid was below the maximum\nthat either act allows for a penalty. Presumably, then, all settlement money that flowed to State\nX is non-deductible, all of it having been paid as penalty. State Y and State Z law are less clear\nabout whether an anti-trust monetary judgment is a penalty or simple damages. However, the\nfact that those states also filed their complaint under federal anti-trust statutes, and the amount\nthat Taxpayer paid was well within the penalty limits of that law, means that the payment can\nreasonably be treated as a penalty. Furthermore, the plaintiffs’ complaint specifically requests civil penalties, at paragraph\n51, while it does not specifically request compensatory damages anywhere. It would be\ninconsistent with the relief requested to assume that the Taxpayer’s $amount1 payment\nconstituted deductible damages. Taxpayer may argue that the payment was compensation for damages in the three states,\nor that it was an amount paid outside of anti-trust law to settle the suit. It may point to the fact\nthat the settlement does not admit any wrongdoing on the company’s part. The admission of\nwrongdoing is not necessary for IRC 162(f) to apply; all that is necessary is that the payment be\nmost properly characterized as a penalty. Here, Taxpayer paid $amount1 to settle anti-trust\nallegations, and had Taxpayer been found liable for these allegations, it would have been subject\nto a fine of up to $10 million. PREF-123891-07\n7 Conclusion\nTaxpayer’s $amount1 payment in settlement of the anti-trust claims of States X, Y, and Z\nwas the payment of a penalty, and is thus not a deductible business expense under IRC 162(f).
