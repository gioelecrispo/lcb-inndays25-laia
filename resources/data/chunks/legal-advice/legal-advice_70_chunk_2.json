  "chunk_text": "The\nStipulated Judgment provides for $----------------of compensation, payable for the taking of the\nproperty rights identified in the complaint and declaration of taking “together with all\nimprovements thereon and appurtenances thereunto belonging.”2 In addition, the Stipulated\nJudgment also provided that just compensation for any occupancy for the period -------------------------- through --------------------------would be $-----------per month. ------ received $--------------of taking proceeds in ------. Of this amount, -------reported $-------------as sales proceeds on their ------ Schedule D. Furthermore, ------ reported a $--------- tax basis\nfor the land and building resulting in a gain of $-------------. The remaining $------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------proceeds were deferred\non ------’s return until -------. In --------------reported $----------------of proceeds in addition to the\ndeferred $--------------from ------- as sales proceeds on Schedule D. ------ reported a basis in the\nproperties of $-------------, resulting in a gain of $-------------. Exam Position: 1 Amounts were deposited through the term of the taking, and at the time of the Final Judgment $---------------had\nbeen deposited. ------ withdrew each deposit. 2 While the Stipulated Judgment provided for $-----------------of proceeds, -------actually received $----------------. 3\nExam issued a Form 886-A to ------ for the $---------------- ------ received for the ----month period. Exam allocated proceeds in the amount of $----------------based on the appraisals commissioned\nby ------ for a ----month period. Using the percentages based on those appraisals, Exam\nallocated the balance of the $--------------between the ----------------and the -----------------------------for the remaining ----months as follows: -------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ---------% ---------% Allocation of Remaining\nProceeds ------------------- ------------------- --------------------- Total allocated --------------------- ------------------ -------------------- FMV\nPercentage Totals --------------------- Exam proposed that the taking proceeds allocable to both the ----------------and the ---------------------------- were in the nature of rent and therefore taxable as ordinary income. Furthermore,\nExam concluded that ------ had not demonstrated that any of the proceeds were for the loss of\nrestoration rights with respect to either parcel, and therefore -------was not entitled to capital gain\nor loss treatment under I.R.C. § 1234A for any portion of the proceeds. -------s Amended Return:\n------ filed an amended return and requested I.R.C. § 1033(a)(2) treatment for the proceeds from\nthe taking. ------ has not yet acquired replacement property but requested an extension of time\nto acquire the replacement property on their amended return. Law & Analysis\nI.R.C. § 1033(a)(1) provides that if property is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into\nproperty “similar or related in service or use” through an exchange, no gain is recognized. However, if the property is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into money or property not\nsimilar or related in service or use, gain is recognized only to the extent provided in\n§ 1033(a)(2)(A) if the taxpayer elects § 1033 treatment within the prescribed period, and\nacquires property “similar or related in service or use” to the converted property. I.R.C. §\n1033(a)(2)(A)."
