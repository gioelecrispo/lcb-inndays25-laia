  "chunk_text": "It is also clear\nthat ยง 302(b)(3) contains no prohibition against payment of the redemption price on an\ninstallment basis. Lisle v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1976-140, 35 T.C.M. 627, 635. Authorities have been uncovered whereby the Service has successfully\nchallenged purported redemption payments and found them to be taxable to the\nredeeming shareholder as dividends. See, Hays v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 197195 (Although distri-bution was not prorated between shareholders, other determinates\nof dividend equivalence indicated the distribution to be divi-dends). In the case of Lisle,\nthe Service unsuccessfully chal-lenged the payments made to a corporation's two\nprincipal share-holders. Therein, the disputed redemption was structured using initial\ndown payments followed by a 20-year installment payout. The length of payout,\ncoupled with certain retained rights by the shareholders, lead the Service to argue the\npayments were divi-dends rather than redemption amounts. In the present case, with A's surrender of voting power and agreement to $A as\nthe final payment for A's common shares, persuasive evidence of a disguised\nredemption has been shown. 15 POSTF-106186-02 This writing may contain privileged information.
