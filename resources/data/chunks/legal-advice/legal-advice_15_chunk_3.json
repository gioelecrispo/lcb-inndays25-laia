A\nnumber of factors have been identified by the courts in\ndetermining who has the benefits and burdens of ownership. These include (1) whether legal title passes; (2) how the\nparties treat the transaction; (3) whether equity was acquired\nin the property; (4) whether the right of possession is vested\nin the buyer; (5) which party pays the taxes; (6) which party\nbears the risk of loss or damage to the property; and (7) which\nparty receives the profits from the operation and sale of the\nproperty. Grodt & McKay Realty, Inc. v. Commissioner, 77 T.C.\n1221, 1237-38 (1981); Harmston v. Commissioner, 61 T.C. 216\n(1973), aff'd, 528 F.2d 55 (9th Cir. 1976) (A depreciable\ninterest requires that the taxpayer possess the benefits and\nburdens of ownership of the asset). 4 CC:SBSE:2:PIT:POSTS128556-02 5 An\npayphone investor did not possess the benefits and\nburdens of ownership of the payphone. The investor had no\ncontrol whatsoever over the payphone. He or she had no role in\nthe selection of the location of the payphone, either initially\nor thereafter. alone operated and maintained the payphones\nand made all collections from the phone. assumed all the risk\nof loss on the payphones and simply paid the investors a fixed\nmonthly rental check unrelated to the profits of the payphone. had \"sole and absolute control\" over the payphone. More\nimportantly, the investor had the right to resell the phone back\nto\nfor its original purchase price upon - days notice during\nthe first -- years of the lease. This buy-back provision\nenabled the investor to shift the entire risk of loss from the\ninvestment to . The investor also had no right to share in any\nprofits of the phone if its earnings exceeded the fixed monthly\npayment. In sum, the investors never acquired a depreciable\ninterest in the\npayphones and are not entitled to claim any\ndepreciation on the payphones on their tax returns. 2 2. Allowance of Loss\nA number of future events might affect the amount and\ntiming of the taxpayers' losses. For example, investors could\nreceive payment from the bankruptcy estate, from ----------------, or from the individual who sold them the investment. Any\nrecovery would reduce their loss as would depreciation\ndeductions not previously disallowed. Any taxpayers who opted out of the ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ bankruptcy plan provision may\nnow have a recognizable loss, but not if they have claims\npending against whoever marketed the investment to them. Clearly, no loss is allowed prior to - when the bankruptcy\nplan was effective (unless the taxpayer disposed of the phone at\na loss prior to that year). We are still gathering facts to\ndetermine the nature of the potential losses(theft or capital)\nand the year of the loss. This writing may contain privileged information. 2 Any It should be noted that during the bankruptcy proceeding\nargued that it, rather than the investors, was the true owner of\nthe payphones.
