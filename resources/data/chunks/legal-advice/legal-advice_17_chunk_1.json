FACTS\n------------ and its U.S. subsidiaries (hereinafter\n“Taxpayer”) is a defense contractor primarily engaged in\nproviding products and services under long-term contracts with\nthe United States Government (“U.S. Government”) and, to a lesser\ndegree, with foreign governments or foreign entities. A\nsignificant number of these long-term contracts were entered\nprior to, and during, the tax years currently under examination\n(taxable years ending December 31, -,\nDecember 31, -, and December 31, -).

Relevant Contracts Taxpayer's long-term contracts relevant to the ETI issue\nwere entered under both of the systems by which foreign\ngovernments may acquire U.S. defense articles and services:\n(1) government-to-government Foreign Military Sales; and\n(2) contractor-to-government Direct Commercial Sales. Foreign Military Sales (“FMS”)\nAs described in a United States General Accounting Office\nReport to the Secretary of Defense:\nThe Arms Export Control Act gives the President\nauthority to sell defense articles and services to\neligible foreign countries, generally at no cost to\nthe U.S. government. While the Defense Security\nCooperation Agency (DSCS) has overall responsibility\nfor administering the FMS program, the Army, Navy, and\nAir Force generally execute the sales agreementscommonly referred to as sales cases. Foreign military sales are made on an individual\ncase basis. A foreign country representative\ninitiates a case by sending a letter of request to DOD\n[Department of Defense] asking for information, such\nas the price and availability of goods, training,\ntechnical assistance, follow-on support, or other\nservices. Once the customer decides to proceed with\nthe purchase, DOD prepares a Letter of Offer and\nAcceptance (LOA) stating the terms of the sale for the\nitems and services being provided. After the LOA is\naccepted, the FMS customer is generally required to\npay, in advance, amounts necessary to cover costs\nassociated with the services or items purchased from\nDOD. The Department of the Treasury holds these CC:LM:HMT:--------:POSTF-103313-03 page 4 advance payments in an FMS trust fund."
