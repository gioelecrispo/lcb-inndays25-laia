Facts:\nIn Month 1, Year 1, -------- (“Taxpayer”) approved a development project in City, State\nwhich was to include active adult homes in a golf course community (“Community\nProject”). The project originally included N1 active homes, but in early Year 2, due to\nthe pressures of a market downturn, the Community Project was renegotiated and\nrestructured. On Date 1, Taxpayer entered into two agreements with Inc. 1., Inc. 2, and\nPrincipal (collectively, “Seller”): (1) a purchase agreement (Year 2 Purchase\nAgreement) to buy N2 finished lots on N3 acres in City, State from Seller and (2) an\nAmenity Center Contract for the construction of a N4 sq. ft. center with amenities for the\nproperty. In addition, Taxpayer entered into a third agreement with the Seller: an oral\nagreement under which Taxpayer would construct the amenity center and the Seller\nwould reimburse Taxpayer the costs. Principal personally guaranteed the obligations\nunder each of the agreements. In total, the three agreements (collectively “Year 2\nAgreements”) called for Taxpayer to deposit approximately $Amount 1.1 Under the\nterms of the Year 2 Purchase Agreement, Taxpayer was required to pay $Amount 2 per\nlot delivered by Seller. The total deposit of $Amount 3 was to be applied to the\npurchase of the developed lots as the Seller completed development of the lots. The\ndeposit was applied toward the purchase of each lot at the rate of $Amount 4 per lot. Of\nthe $Amount 3 deposit, $Amount 5 remained after delivery of N5 developed lots by\nSeller in Year 2 and Year 3. Whether the taxpayer is entitled to an abandonment loss\nfor this remaining amount of the deposit is the subject of this memo. Principal died unexpectedly in Month 2, Year 2. Construction of the Community Project\n(including the amenity center) ceased in mid-Year 3. According to Taxpayer, Principal’s\ndeath led to a ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Year 2 ------------------------------. In a letter dated Date 2\nfrom Taxpayer’s Attorney to the Seller, Taxpayer alleges that “--------------------------------------------------------- -Year 2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.” Following this letter, in Month 3, Year 3, Taxpayer sued Seller for failure to fulfill\nits contractual obligations. At the time Taxpayer filed suit, Taxpayer had acquired N5\ndeveloped lots from the Seller at a cost of $Amount 6 (N5 lots at $Amount 4per lot)."

At the time Taxpayer filed suit, Taxpayer had acquired N5\ndeveloped lots from the Seller at a cost of $Amount 6 (N5 lots at $Amount 4per lot). The initial deposit of $Amount 3 was applied toward the purchase of the delivered lots. Therefore, the remaining unapplied balance on the initial deposit at the time of the suit\n1 The Year 2 Purchase Agreement for developed lots required Taxpayer to deliver a total deposit of\n$Amount 3 (an initial deposit of $Amount 7 and an additional deposit of $Amount 8) which was paid by\nthe Taxpayer to Seller in Year 2. 4\nwas $Amount 5. In the suit, Taxpayer sought return of the $Amount 5 deposit\n(“Deposit”) under the Year 2 Agreements. 2 Seller counter sued. A memorandum\nwritten by the Division President of Taxpayer’s Central State Division from Month 4\nYear 5 (“President’s Overview”) stated that, as estimated by ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.3 In Month 6, Year 4, Taxpayer terminated its selling efforts related to the homes it\nconstructed at the Community Project and closed its sales center on the premises. At this point, of the N5 developed lots that Taxpayer had acquired since Year 2,\nthere remained N8 unsold developed lots, N13 model homes and N14 spec\nhomes in various stages of completion. In an e-mail to the then current owners of\nthe community, Taxpayer informed said owners it would -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.4 In a correspondence dated -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Consistent with\nthis statement, Taxpayer continued to pursue its remedies against the Seller. Through a series of negotiations and court filings in the litigation, the parties\nentered into a purchase contract on Date 5 (“Year 4 Agreement”). Prior to the\nexecution of the Year 4 Agreement, Taxpayer’s Management documented its\nposition with respect to the Community Project in a Date 6 memorandum (“Date 6\nMemo”) to its Asset Management Committee (“Management Committee”). The\nstated purpose of the Date 6 Memo was to “----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------” The Date 6 Memo noted that, as of Month 7, Year\n4, Taxpayer’s investment in the Community Project included the following four\ncomponents of costs:\nCommon Development Costs\nDeposit under former Lot Purchase Agreement\nReceivable related to Amenity Center\nLot Cost Receivable\n2 $Amount 10\n$Amount 11\n$Amount 12\n$Amount 13\n$Amount 145 A memorandum written by the Division President of Taxpayer’s Central State Division from Month 4,\nYear 5 states that Taxpayer is seeking a return of the $Amount 1deposit. The $Amount 1 includes the\nbalance of $Amount 9 of the deposit and $Amount 20 related to the amenity center contract at the time\nthe Taxpayer filed suit in mid-Year 3. 3\nSecond paragraph, section I of President’s Overview dated Month 4, Year 5. While the Month 4, Year 5\nPresident’s Overview states that Taxpayer is seeking a return of the $Amount 1 deposit, the suit\nTaxpayer filed against Seller sought return of the $Amount 5. 4\nPresident’s Overview (Month 4, Year 5). 5\nThe Month 5 Year 4 Memo showed the numbers without the last three zeroes.

Since the Taxpayer would develop the land\nunder the Year 4 Purchase Agreement, it was necessary that these rights were part of the transfer of the\nN7 acres. 6\nAgreement also gave Taxpayer title to the amenity site as well as the structure\nwhich Taxpayer later incorporated into the new amenity center. Upon the closing\nof the Year 4 Agreement, N11 homes were planned for the Community Project,\nN12 of which Taxpayer built and sold between Year 2 and the middle of Year 3. The closing date for the Year 4 Agreement was set at Date 7. This date was later\nextended to Date 8, via amendments to the Year 4 Agreement. The Date 8 date\naligns with the date the parties executed the Settlement Agreement, discussed\nbelow. The Year 4 Agreement is prefaced with statements referring to Taxpayer’s desire\nto purchase the property10 and references the parties’ desire to “----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------.” Section 11 of the Year 4 Agreement addresses the “Pending\nLitigation” between the parties and states -----------------------------------------------------related to the Year 2 Agreements until the “---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Year 4 -------------------------------------.” Further, the parties “----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------”\nclosing of the Year 4 Agreement.

Under the Year 4 Agreement, the remedy to Taxpayer,\nin the event of Seller default, is specific performance. 10 This property represents a smaller, “------------------” project than the project which was the subject of the\nYear 2 Purchase Agreements. 7 The status of the Community Project was the subject of the previously referenced\nPresident’s Overview in Date 6 from the Division President of Taxpayer’s Central\nState Division.11 In the Overview, the Division President summarized the\nbackground of this project, tracing the historical progression from the Year 1\napproval of the project to the Year 2 renegotiation and Year 2 Agreements, to the\ndeath of Seller’s principal in Year 3, the ensuing litigation, and its decision to\ncease sales and operations in the Community Project in Month 6, Year 4. The\nOverview then explained that Taxpayer is ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Both options were discussed in\nthe Overview, with a detailed analysis of both risks and opportunities under both\nscenarios. Under the --------------------------------, the Overview stated that Taxpayer’s\ncalculations indicate a “----------------------$Amount 17” and suggests that other\nintangibles, such as impact on Taxpayer’s brand name, as well as ------------ and -------- reputations, need to be considered. Discussion under the -----------------------provided ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. The --------------------------included a financial\noverview of the Purchase Agreement executed in Year 4. The Overview provided\nthat for $Amount 18 Taxpayer would acquire N7 acres along with entitlements for\ndeveloping and building N6 dwelling units for no additional consideration and the\namenity center and capacity reservations. The Overview noted that no deposit is\ndue with the transaction as Taxpayer “------------------------$Amount 19 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.” The Division\nPresident then provided that assuming the closing occurs on Date 8, per the terms\nof the Year 4 Agreement, all claims in the litigation between Taxpayer and Seller\nwould be dismissed. The Division President concluded by recommending that\nTaxpayer adopt the ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, and “------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.” On Date 8, the date of the closing of the Year 4 Agreement, the parties executed a\nsettlement agreement (“the Settlement Agreement”) which referenced the Year 2\nAgreements and Year 4 Agreement, and dismissed all issues in the litigation\nbetween Taxpayer and Seller. Specifically, the Settlement Agreement provides as\nfollows: “-------------------------------------------------Year 4 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.” The Settlement Agreement also states that the parties “--11 The Overview was submitted by the Division President to the Taxpayer’s President. 8\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Year 2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------“. . . and that, via the\nSettlement Agreement, “-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.” On Taxpayer’s Form 1120, U.S. Corporate Income Tax Return, for Year 4, the\nabandonment loss of $ Amount 5 relating to the Deposit was reflected on Line 26\n(Other Deductions) on a separate line named \"Preacquisition Expenses.\" Discussion\n1. Taxpayer Has Not Established Abandonment of the Community Project related\nto the Community Project for Purposes of section 165. To be allowable as a deduction under section 165, a loss must be evidenced by a\nclosed and completed transaction, fixed by an identifiable event. Treas. Reg.\n§ 1.165-1(b) and 1(d)(1).

United Dairy\nFarmers, Inc. v. U.S., 267 F.3d 510, 522 (6th Cir. 2001). To establish the\nabandonment of an asset for purposes of section 165, a taxpayer must show both\n(1) an intention to abandon the asset, and (2) an affirmative act of abandonment. CRST, Inc. v. Commissioner, 92 T.C. 1249, 1257 (1989), aff'd, 909 F.2d 1146 (8th\nCir. 1990); A.J. Industries, Inc. v. United States, 503 F.2d 660, 670 (9th Cir. 1974);\nRev. Rul. 93-80, 1993-2 C.B. 239. An affirmative act of abandonment must be\nascertained from all the facts and surrounding circumstances. Burke v.\nCommissioner, 32 T.C. 775, 780 (1959), aff’d, 283 F.2d 487 (9th Cir. 1960). Taxpayer argues that it abandoned the Community Project. Taxpayer states, “------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.”12\nTaxpayer determined that “certain components” of the Community Project\nincluding the Deposit, had been rendered “without value.” Taxpayer argues the\ncompany’s determination that the Deposit had “no value” and its decision in Date\n6 to write the amount off is an identifiable event leading to abandonment. However, in Corra Resources v. Commissioner, 945 F.2d 224, 226 (7th Cir. 1991),\nthe Seventh Circuit observed that, “[i]ntra-corporate affairs . . . do not generate\nsigns visible to outside observers and therefore do not mark the crossing of the\n12 Page 4, Taxpayer Memo to Exam, Date 3. 9\nRubicon.” Id. at 226. Thus, the intra-company communications of Taxpayer,\nbetween its management and/or Division and even its communication to its\naccounting department to write off the project “do not generate signs visible to\noutside observers” and therefore do not constitute an “identifiable event” to\nestablish an abandonment. Taxpayer asserted that it informed Seller of its intention to “walk away” from the\nproject. 13 Taxpayer may further argue that it acted to abandon the Community\nProject in Month 6 Year 4, when it terminated its selling efforts of the\ndevelopment, closed the sales center, and ceased construction of the amenity\ncenter. While these facts may be relevant to consider, an intent to abandon and\nan affirmative act of abandonment must be ascertained by examining all the facts\nand surrounding circumstances. As discussed below, there are several acts and events that occurred in Year 4\nthat, together, show that Taxpayer did not irrevocably cut ties with the Community\nProject and did not intend to abandon the Community Project. A. The Year 2 Agreements and the Year 4 Agreement are Part of the Process\nof Acquisition of the Community Project. Section 165 requires that substance, not form, govern in determining a deductible\nloss. Treas. Reg. § 1.165-1(b). Mere changes in the terms of a transaction do not\nconstitute abandonment. An otherwise abandoned expenditure, if part of an\nintegrated plan that is implemented, is not an abandonment loss under section\n165. Nicolazzi v. Commissioner, 79 T.C. 109, 132 (1982), aff’d, 722 F.2d 324 (6th\nCir. 1983). Furthermore, if potential transactions are alternatives, only one of\nwhich can be completed, no abandonment loss is proper unless the taxpayer\nabandons the entire transaction."

Furthermore, if potential transactions are alternatives, only one of\nwhich can be completed, no abandonment loss is proper unless the taxpayer\nabandons the entire transaction. Haspel v. Commissioner, 62 T.C. 59, 72-73\n(1974) (taxpayers were not entitled to an abandonment loss for the cost of original\narchitectural plans which were rejected, since the original plans for the foundation\nand superstructure were an integral and inseparable part of a continuous project). In FRGC Investment, LLC v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2002-276, aff’d, 89 F.\nA’ppx. 656 (9th Cir. 2004), the Tax Court denied a 1997 tax year abandonment\nloss where the circumstances surrounding the taxpayer’s project showed that\nrenegotiation and obstacles over several years were merely steps in continuing\nand successful attempts to acquire the property. In 1995, the taxpayer entered\ninto a real estate contract to purchase 240 acres for development from an entity\nowned by an individual. After objections to surveys and other title reports, the\nescrow for the contract was cancelled. In 1996, the taxpayer entered into a\nsecond real estate contract with the same entity to purchase 404 acres of the\n13 Taxpayer mentions in its Date 3, Memo to Exam that it communicated its decision to walk away from\nthe project. Taxpayer, however, has not provided any facts to support it informed Seller. 10\nsame land for development. Approval for zoning the development became\nunlikely so in 1997, the taxpayer and the entity executed mutual cancellations of\nthe contract to release the escrow. In 1998, the taxpayer and the individual\nowning the entity that was a party to the first two contracts decided to execute a\nthird contract. The contract was fulfilled and the escrow closed that same year,\nresulting in taxpayer owning the land that it sought to develop. The taxpayer\nclaimed a section 165 loss for expenses incurred in 1997, and argued that the\n1997 contract had been abandoned due to the cancelled escrows. The tax court\ndisagreed and found that the taxpayer's claims that the 1998 contract was\ndifferent from the purportedly abandoned 1997 contract were rebutted by the fact\nthat the taxpayer moved forward to purchase the same real estate for the same\npurpose, although there had been changes in the terms of the agreement. The\ncourt viewed the earlier 1995 and 1996 purchase agreements as steps in the\ntaxpayer’s continuing efforts to acquire the property. Additionally, the taxpayer\nentered into a new purchase agreement with the counter-party only two weeks\nafter the cancellation of the 1996 purchase agreement. The court held the\ntaxpayer’s execution of a new purchase agreement in January 1998 to be\ninconsistent with the taxpayer’s contention that the project was abandoned in\n1997. The court further found that in substance, the first agreement was merely a\nstep in the partnership’s continuing and successful attempts to acquire the\nproperty. In the present case, Taxpayer continued its effort to acquire the Community\nProject through Year 4, as evidenced by the Year 2 Agreements and Year 4\nAgreement. These agreements, along with the pursuit of legal remedies and\ncontinued negotiations, were all steps in the process to acquire the Community\nProject."

These agreements, along with the pursuit of legal remedies and\ncontinued negotiations, were all steps in the process to acquire the Community\nProject. Taxpayer views the Year 4 Agreement as separate and distinct from the\nYear 2 Agreement, the related litigation and the Settlement Agreement. A review\nof Taxpayer’s own records, however, demonstrates that it treated all these\ntransactions and the litigation as intertwined with the ultimate goal of acquiring and\ndeveloping the Community project: 1. The Date 6 Memo from Taxpayer’s management to the Management\nCommittee discusses the Taxpayer’s investments with regard to the Year 2\nAgreements and references the deposits under the agreements. The Date 6\nMemo goes on to state that -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Taxpayer states that settlement of the Year 2\nAgreements and its related litigation will be “-------------------------------------------------------------------.” The principal terms of the anticipated settlement are\nembodied in the Year 4 Agreement. 2. The Year 4 Agreement is prefaced with statements which refer to\nTaxpayer’s desire to purchase property subject to certain terms and\nconditions and goes on to state that the parties desire to “------------------------- 11\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.” The language within the Year 4 Agreement supports the\nview that the Year 4 Agreement was designed to settle the legal disputes\nbetween the parties arising out of the Year 2 Agreements in the form of a\nrenegotiated purchase agreement for the Community Project. 3. In the Month 4 Year 5 President’s Overview, which described events of\nYear 4 and prior years, Taxpayer requested approval of the --------------------------------as laid out under the terms of the Year 4 Agreement. The Year 4\nagreement is referenced in the Settlement Agreement. In the Overview,\nTaxpayer again discusses the project from its inception, beginning in Year\n1, and describes the Year 2 and Year 4 Agreements. The Overview\nconcludes that a -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------“------------------------------------------------------------------------------.” Furthermore,\nthe --------------------------did not require a deposit as the Taxpayer previously\npaid Seller a $Amount 19 deposit on the original contract with Seller. In\naddition, the Overview specified that if the Seller defaulted on the Year 4\nAgreement, the litigation between Taxpayer and Seller would resume since\nthe Year 4 Agreement was considered by the parties as the form of the\nsettlement. Accordingly, the Year 4 Agreement and the Settlement\nAgreement were dependent on one another. Taxpayer saw the series of\ntransactions as part of the overall strategy related to the acquisition of the\nCommunity Project. 4. The Settlement Agreement incorporates by reference the series of\ntransactions and agreements, including the Year 2 Agreements, the Year 4\nAgreement, as well as the litigation, and notes that each item is a material\nfact underlying the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement\nfurther provides that it and the Year 4 Agreement supersede and cancel\nany and all prior agreements, negotiations, arrangements and\nunderstandings between Seller and Taxpayer. In addition, the fact that Taxpayer continued to service the existing homes already\nsold at the Community Project is further evidence that Taxpayer did not intend to\nabandon the Community Project."

This is consistent with the language in section\n19 of the Year 4 Agreement that mentions Taxpayer’s sales of homes to\ncustomers in the Community Project and that “--------------------------------------------------------------------” as part of the Taxpayer’s development. These facts collectively show that in substance, Taxpayer’s business purpose was\nto acquire the Community Project in State. The Year 2 Agreements and the\nnegotiations that led to the Year 4 Agreement were steps in Taxpayer’s continued\nefforts to acquire the Community Project. These integrated steps to acquire the\nCommunity Project do not support a claim of abandonment. 12 B. The Ongoing Litigation For a loss to be sustained under section 165, a loss must be evidenced by closed\nand completed transactions. United States v. S.S. White Dental Manufacturing\nCo., 274 U.S. 398, 401 (1927); Treas. Reg. § 1.165-1(b). Thus, if there exists a\nclaim for reimbursement with respect to which there is a reasonable prospect of\nrecovery, the loss is not deductible until it can be ascertained with reasonable\ncertainty whether such reimbursement will be received. Treas. Reg. § 1.1651(d)(2)(i); Ramsey Scarlett & Co. v. Commissioner, 61 T.C. 795, 806-807 (1974),\naff’d, 521 F.2d 786 (4th Cir. 1975); Estate of Scofield v. Commissioner, 266 F.2d\n154, 159 (6th Cir. 1959), aff’g and rev’g. in part 25 T.C. 774 (1956). Whether a\nreasonable prospect of recovery exists is to be determined by all of the facts and\ncircumstances. In determining whether a taxpayer had a reasonable prospect of\nrecovery, the fact that the taxpayer filed a lawsuit to recover the loss gives rise to\nan inference that the taxpayer has such prospect. Dawn v. Commissioner, 675\nF.2d 1077, 1078 (9th Cir. 1982). See also Estate of Scofield, 266 F.2d at 159. Treas. Reg. § 1.165-1(d)(2)(i) requires that a taxpayer ascertain with “reasonable\ncertainty” whether it will receive reimbursement for the loss before deducting a\nloss under section 165. The examples provided in Treas. Reg. § 1.165-1(d)(2)(i)\ninvolve some type of resolution of a claim for reimbursement, for example, a\nsettlement, adjudication, or abandonment of a claim. In addition, before a\ntaxpayer takes a loss, the regulation requires that the taxpayer produce objective\nevidence of abandonment of the claim, such as the execution of a release. Taxpayer has not shown that in Year 4 it did not have a reasonable prospect of\nrecovery or that it abandoned its claims against Seller in the litigation. Taxpayer\ncontinued to pursue litigation against Seller through Year 4 to enforce its rights\nrelated to the Community Project, including engaging in settlement negotiations\nwith the Seller to attempt to resolve the litigation. The taxpayer’s continuance of\nthe litigation in Year 4 is inconsistent with an intent to abandon the project in that\nyear. The recovery process was not finalized until the Settlement Agreement was\nexecuted on Date 8, which resulted in the dismissal of the litigation."

      "content": "The taxpayer’s continuance of\nthe litigation in Year 4 is inconsistent with an intent to abandon the project in that\nyear. The recovery process was not finalized until the Settlement Agreement was\nexecuted on Date 8, which resulted in the dismissal of the litigation. In addition,\nunder the terms of the Year 4 Agreement, Taxpayer agreed to relinquish its claim\nto the deposit pending the closing of the Year 4 Agreement which occurred on\nDate 8. Thus, there was no closed and completed transaction in Year 4. Conclusion: To be allowable as a deduction under section 165, a loss must be evidenced by a\nclosed and completed transaction, and fixed by an identifiable event. In this case,\nexamining all the facts and circumstances, Taxpayer did not sustain an\nabandonment loss in Year 4. The facts and circumstances, including ongoing\nlitigation, the settlement negotiations, and the executed purchase agreement in 13\nOctober of Year 4 collectively show that Taxpayer did not sustain an\nabandonment loss in Year 4.
