No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. • If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. • If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. • If the parents don’t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. • If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. • If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J’s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent’s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number.

How Long Should\nRecords Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items\nappearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and\n1099) until the statute of limitations runs\nout for that return. Usually, this is 3\nyears from the date the return was due or\nfiled or 2 years from the date the tax was\npaid, whichever is later. You should\nkeep some records longer. For example,\nkeep property records (including those\non your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or\nreplacement property. For more details,\nsee chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return\nFile Form 1040-X to change a return\nyou already filed. Generally, Form\n1040-X must be filed within 3 years af- ter the date the original return was filed\nor within 2 years after the date the tax\nwas paid, whichever is later. But you\nmay have more time to file Form\n1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically\nor mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. Use the Where's My Amended Return\napplication on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return.

Death of a Taxpayer If a taxpayer died before filing a return\nfor 2022, the taxpayer's spouse or personal representative may have to file and\nsign a return for that taxpayer. A personal representative can be an executor, administrator, or anyone who is in charge\nof the deceased taxpayer's property. If\nthe deceased taxpayer didn't have to file\na return but had tax withheld, a return\nmust be filed to get a refund. The person\nwho files the return must enter “Deceased,” the deceased taxpayer's name,\nand the date of death across the top of\nthe return. If this information isn't provided, it may delay the processing of the\nreturn. If your spouse died in 2022 and you\ndidn't remarry in 2022, or if your spouse\ndied in 2023 before filing a return for\n2022, you can file a joint return. A joint\nreturn should show your spouse's 2022\nincome before death and your income for all of 2022. Enter “Filing as surviving spouse” in the area where you sign\nthe return."
