ANNEX THE 7th ENVIRONMENT ACTION PROGRAMME TO 2020 Â“ LIVING WELL, WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR PLANET 1. The following 2050 vision is intended to help guide action up to and beyond 2020: In 2050, we live well, within the planets ecological limits. Our prosperity and healthy environment stem from an innovative, circular economy where nothing is wasted and where natural resources are managed sustainably, and biodiversity is protected, valued and restored in ways that enhance our societys resilience. Our low-carbon growth has long been decoupled from resource use, setting the pace for a safe and sustainable global society. A PROGRAMME FOR ACTION TO 2020 2. Over the past 40 years, a broad range of environment legislation has been put in place, amounting to the most comprehensive modern standards in the world. This has helped to address some of the most serious environmental concerns of citizens and businesses in the Union. 3. Emissions of pollutants to air, water and soil have been reduced significantly over the past decades, as have GHG emissions in recent years. Union chemicals legislation has been modernised and the use of many toxic or hazardous substances such as lead, cadmium and mercury has been restricted in products found in most households. Union citizens enjoy a level of water quality that is among the best in the world, and over 18 % of the Unions territory and 4 % of its seas have been designated as protected areas for nature."
