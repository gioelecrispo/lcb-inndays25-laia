In order to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council are able to follow the implementation of this Decision, the Commission should regularly inform them of developments relating to the assistance and provide them with relevant documents. (23) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). (24) The Unions macro-financial assistance should be subject to economic policy conditions, to be laid down in a Memorandum of Understanding. In order to ensure uniform conditions of implementation and for reasons of efficiency, the Commission should be empowered to negotiate such conditions with the Kyrgyz authorities under the supervision of the committee of representatives of the Member States in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. Under that Regulation, the advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as provided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially important impact of assistance of more than EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used for operations above that threshold. Considering the amount of the Unions macro-financial assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic, the advisory procedure should apply to the adoption of the Memorandum of Understanding, and to any reduction, suspension or cancellation of the assistance. (25) According to the IMF, the Kyrgyz Republic falls under the category of emerging and developing economies; according to the World Bank, the Kyrgyz Republic is part of the group of low-income economies and International Development Association (IDA) countries; according to the UN-OHRLLS (5), the Kyrgyz Republic falls under the category of landlocked-developing country; according to the OECDs Development Assistance Committee, it is in the list of other low income countries. Therefore, the Kyrgyz Republic should be considered to be a developing country in the sense of Article 208 of the Treaty, which justifies the choice of Article 209 of the Treaty as a legal basis for this Decision, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 1. The Union shall make macro-financial assistance available to the Kyrgyz Republic (the Unions macro-financial assistance) of a maximum amount of EUR 30 million, with a view to supporting the Kyrgyz Republics economic stabilisation and covering its balance of payments needs as identified in the current IMF programme. Of that maximum amount, up to EUR 15 million shall be provided in the form of loans and up to EUR 15 million in the form of grants. The release of the Unions macro-financial assistance is subject to the approval of the Union budget for the relevant year by the European Parliament and the Council."
