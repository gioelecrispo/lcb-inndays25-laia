  "chunk_text": "(9) In December 2012, in view of the worsening economic situation and outlook, Jordan requested Union macro-financial assistance. (10) Given that Jordan is a country covered by the ENP, it should be considered to be eligible to receive Union macro-financial assistance. (11) Given that there is still a significant residual external financing gap in Jordans balance of payments over and above the resources provided by IMF and other multilateral institutions, and despite the implementation of strong economic stabilisation and reform programmes by Jordan, and given the vulnerability of Jordans external financial position to exogenous shocks, which requires an appropriate level of the foreign exchange reserves to be maintained, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Jordan (the Unions macro-financial assistance) is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Jordans request to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the IMF programme. The Unions macro-financial assistance would support the economic stabilisation and the structural reform agenda of Jordan, supplementing resources made available under the IMFs financial arrangement. (12) The Unions macro-financial assistance should aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external financing situation for Jordan, thereby supporting its economic and social development. (13) The determination of the amount of the Unions macro-financial assistance is based on a complete quantitative assessment of Jordans residual external financing needs, and takes into account its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, in particular the international reserves at its disposal. The Unions macro-financial assistance should complement the programmes and resources provided by the IMF and the World Bank. The determination of the amount of the assistance also takes into account expected financial contributions from multilateral donors and the need to ensure fair burden sharing between the Union and other donors, as well as the pre-existing deployment of the Unions other external financing instruments in Jordan and the added value of the overall Union involvement. (14) The Commission should ensure that the Unions macro-financial assistance is legally and substantially in line with the key principles, objectives and measures taken within the different areas of external action and other relevant Union policies. (15) The Unions macro-financial assistance should support the Unions external policy towards Jordan. Commission services and the European External Action Service should work closely together throughout the macro-financial assistance operation in order to coordinate, and to ensure the consistency of, Union external policy. (16) The Unions macro-financial assistance should support Jordans commitment to values shared with the Union, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights, sustainable development and poverty reduction, as well as its commitment to the principles of open, rule-based and fair trade. (17) A precondition for granting the Unions macro-financial assistance should be that Jordan respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights."
