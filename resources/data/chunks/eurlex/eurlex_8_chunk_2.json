  "chunk_text": "The first of those operations, which was of an amount of EUR 46 million made entirely in the form of grants, was implemented in 2009-2010. The second, which was again for an amount of EUR 46 million, made half in grants and half in loans, was implmented in 2015-2017. The Union has also made EUR 610-746 million available to Georgia under the European Neighbourhood Instrument for the period 2014-2020, including budgetary support and technical assistance. In addition, Georgia benefits from the Neighbourhood Investment Facility which contributed approximatly EUR 86 million to projects in Georgia during the period of 2008-2017. (7) Given that Georgia is a country covered by the ENP, it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. (8) The Union's macro-financial assistance should be an exceptional financial instrument of untied and undesignated balance-of-payments support, which aims at addressing the beneficiary's immediate external financing needs and should underpin the implementation of a policy programme containing strong immediate adjustment and structural reform measures designed to improve the balance-of-payments position in the short term. (9) Given that there is still a significant residual external financing gap in Georgia's balance of payments over and above the resources provided by the IMF and other multilateral institutions, the Union's macro-financial assistance assistance to Georgia is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Georgia's request to support its economic stabilisation, in conjunction with the IMF programme. The Union's macro-financial assistance would support the economic stabilisation and the structural reform agenda of Georgia, supplementing resources made available under the IMF's financial arrangement. (10) The Union's macro-financial assistance should aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external financing situation for Georgia thereby supporting its economic and social development. (11) The determination of the amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance is based on a complete quantitative assessment of Georgia's residual external financing needs, and takes into account its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, in particular the international reserves at its disposal. The Union's macro-financial assistance should complement the programmes and resources provided by the IMF and the World Bank. The determination of the amount of the assistance also takes into account expected financial contributions from bilateral and multilateral donors and the need to ensure fair burden sharing between the Union and other donors, as well as the pre-existing deployment of the Union's other external financing instruments in Georgia and the added value of the overall Union involvement. (12) Taking into consideration Georgia's residual external financing needs, the level of its economic and social development as measured by per capita income and the incidence of poverty, as well as its level of indebtedness, a part of the assistance should be provided in the form of grants."
