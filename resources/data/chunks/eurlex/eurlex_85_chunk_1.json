The Union grants Generalised System of Preferences treatment to the Kyrgyz Republic.

At that meeting, the Union announced that it would provide up to EUR 117,9 million in financial assistance. (4) The Council, meeting in its foreign affairs configuration, in its conclusions on the Kyrgyz Republic of 26 July 2010, welcomed the efforts of the new Kyrgyz government to establish a democratic institutional framework and invited the Commission to continue providing assistance, including in the form of new assistance programmes, to the authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic in the implementation of their reform programme and to contribute to the sustainable economic and social development of the country. (5) Union political and economic support to the Kyrgyz Republics incipient parliamentary democracy would provide a political signal of the Unions strong support to democratic reforms in Central Asia, consistent with the Unions policy towards the region, as set out in the Union Strategy for Central Asia (2007-13) and in the Council conclusions on Central Asia of 25 June 2012."
