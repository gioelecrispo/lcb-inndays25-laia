  "chunk_text": "(6) In line with the Joint Declaration by the European Parliament and the Council adopted together with Decision No 778/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), Union macro-financial assistance should be an exceptional financial instrument of untied and undesignated balance-of-payments support which aims at restoring a beneficiarys sustainable external finance situation and should underpin the implementation of a policy programme containing strong adjustment and structural reform measures designed to improve the balance of payment position, in particular over the programme period, and reinforce the implementation of relevant agreements and programmes with the Union. (7) The economic adjustment and reform process of the Kyrgyz Republic is supported by financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In June 2011, the Kyrgyz authorities and the IMF agreed on a non-precautionary three-year IMF Extended Credit Facility (IMF programme) of SDR 66,6 million (Special Drawing Rights) in support of the country. The IMF approved the fourth review of that programme in June 2013. The objectives of the IMF programme are consistent with the purpose of the Union macro-financial assistance, namely to alleviate short-term balance of payment difficulties, and the implementation of strong adjustment measures consistent with the aim of Union macro-financial assistance. (8) The Union provides sectoral budget support to the Kyrgyz Republic under the Development Cooperation Instrument of a total of EUR 33 million over the period 2011-13 to support reforms in social protection, education and public financial management. (9) In 2010, in view of the worsening economic situation and outlook, the Kyrgyz Republic requested Union macro-financial assistance. (10) Given the Kyrgyz Republics strategic importance for the Union, as well as the determining role it plays in regional stability, the Kyrgyz Republic should, exceptionally, be considered to be eligible to receive Union macro-financial assistance. (11) Given that there is still a significant residual external financing gap in the balance of payments of the Kyrgyz Republic over and above the resources provided by IMF and other multilateral institutions, and despite the implementation of strong economic stabilisation and reform programmes by the Kyrgyz Republic, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to the Kyrgyz Republic (the Unions macro-financial assistance) is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to the Kyrgyz Republics request to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the IMF programme. (12) The Unions macro-financial assistance should aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external financing situation for the Kyrgyz Republic, thereby supporting its economic and social development. (13) The determination of the amount of the Unions macro-financial assistance is based on a complete quantitative assessment of the Kyrgyz Republics residual external financing needs, and takes into account its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, in particular the international reserves at its disposal. The Unions macro-financial assistance should complement the programmes and resources provided by the IMF and the World Bank."
