Joint Statement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission In light of the fiscal challenges and extraordinary circumstances Jordan faces as a result of hosting more than 1,3 million Syrians, the Commission will in 2017, if appropriate, submit a new proposal for extending and increasing MFA to Jordan, upon the successful conclusion of the second MFA and provided that the usual preconditions for this type of assistance, including an updated assessment by the Commission of Jordan's external financing needs, are met. This critical assistance for Jordan would help the country maintain macroeconomic stability while also preserving development gains and continuing with the country's reform agenda."
