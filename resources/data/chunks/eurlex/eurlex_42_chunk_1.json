Moreover, Member States recognised that better public services need to be delivered with fewer resources, and that the potential of e-government can be boosted by promoting a culture of collaboration and improving the conditions for interoperability in European public administrations. (2) In its Communication of 19 May 2010 entitled A Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), one of the flagship initiatives of its Europe 2020 Strategy, the Commission stressed that interoperability is essential for the purpose of maximising the social and economic potential of information and communication technology (ICT) and that, consequently, the digital agenda can be effective only if interoperability is ensured. (3) In its Communication of 16 December 2010 entitled Towards interoperability for European public services, the Commission introduced the European Interoperability Strategy (EIS) and the European Interoperability Framework (EIF). (4) Interoperability facilitates successful implementation of policies and offers great potential to avoid cross-border electronic barriers, further securing the emergence of new, or the consolidation of developing, common public services at Union level. The policies described in the following recitals, in particular, rely on interoperability for their effective and efficient implementation. (5) In the area of the internal market, Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) requires Member States to offer service providers the possibility of completing electronically and across borders all procedures and formalities needed to provide a service outside their Member State of establishment."
