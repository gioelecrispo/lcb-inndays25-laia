  "chunk_text": "To ensure that specific objectives can be properly assessed, they need to be set out in a verifiable and measurable manner. Both the fulfilment of the precondition and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the EEAS. If the precondition and the objectives are not met or if the aims and principles of the Association Agreement are generally disregarded, the Commission should temporarily suspend or cancel the disbursement of the Union's macro-financial assistance. (19) In order to ensure that the Union's financial interests linked to the Union's macro-financial assistance are protected efficiently, the Republic of Moldova should implement appropriate measures relating to the prevention of, and fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to the assistance. The Republic of Moldova should regularly inform the Commission about the implementation of the macro-financial assistance on the basis of full disclosure and strict compliance with the Union's financial rules. In addition, provision should be made for the Commission to carry out checks and for the European Court of Auditors to carry out audits. (20) Release of the Union's macro-financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the European Parliament and the Council (as budgetary authority). (21) The amounts of macro-financial assistance provided in the form of grants and the amounts of the provision required for macro-financial assistance in the form of loans should be consistent with the budgetary appropriations provided for in the multiannual financial framework. (22) The Union's macro-financial assistance should be managed by the Commission. In order to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council are able to follow the implementation of this Decision, the Commission should regularly inform them of developments relating to the assistance and provide them with relevant documents. (23) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). (24) The Union's macro-financial assistance should be subject to conditions, to be laid down in a Memorandum of Understanding. Such conditions should be linked to the disbursement of each of the three instalments. In order to ensure uniform conditions of implementation and for reasons of efficiency, the Commission should be empowered to negotiate such conditions with the authorities of the Republic of Moldova under the supervision of the committee of representatives of the Member States in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. Under that Regulation, the advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as provided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially important impact of assistance of more than EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used for operations above that threshold."
