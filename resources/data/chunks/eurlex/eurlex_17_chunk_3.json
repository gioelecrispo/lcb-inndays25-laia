  "chunk_text": "The Union's macro-financial assistance should complement the programmes and resources provided by the IMF and the World Bank. The determination of the amount of the assistance also takes into account expected financial contributions from multilateral donors and the need to ensure fair burden sharing between the Union and other donors, as well as the pre-existing deployment of the Union's other external financing instruments in the Republic of Moldova and the added value of the overall Union involvement. (14) Taking into consideration the Republic of Moldova's residual external financing needs, the level of its economic development, as measured by per capita income and poverty ratios, its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, in particular the international reserves at its disposal, and the assessment of its ability to repay drawing on debt sustainability analysis, a part of the assistance should be provided in the form of grants. (15) The Commission should ensure that the Union's macro-financial assistance is legally and substantially in line with the key principles and objectives of the different areas of external action, with the measures taken in respect of those areas, and with other relevant Union policies. (16) The Union's macro-financial assistance should support the Union's external policy towards the Republic of Moldova. Commission services and the European External Action Service (EEAS) should work closely together throughout the macro-financial assistance operation in order to coordinate, and to ensure the consistency of, Union external policy. (17) The Union's macro-financial assistance should support the Republic of Moldova's commitment to values shared with the Union, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance, an accountable, transparent and merit-based civil service, an independent judiciary, respect for human rights, the freedom, independence and pluralism of the media, sustainable development and poverty reduction, as well as its commitment to the principles of open, rules-based and fair trade. (18) A pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance and for the disbursement of each of the three instalments should be that the Republic of Moldova respects effective democratic mechanisms  including a multi-party parliamentary system  and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the specific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance management systems, ensure an effective fight against corruption and money laundering, reinforce the governance and supervision of the financial and banking sector in the Republic of Moldova, improve the governance of the energy sector and promote structural reforms aimed at supporting sustainable and inclusive growth, employment creation, a good business climate and fiscal consolidation. The Union's macro-financial assistance to the Republic of Moldova should also include measures to support the implementation of the Association Agreement, including the DCFTA. To ensure that specific objectives can be properly assessed, they need to be set out in a verifiable and measurable manner. Both the fulfilment of the precondition and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the EEAS."
