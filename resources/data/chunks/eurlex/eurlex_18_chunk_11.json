  "chunk_text": "2. PRIMA shall be implemented on the basis of annual work plans covering activities to be undertaken for the period from 1 January to 31 December of a given year (reference year). PRIMA-IS shall adopt the annual work plans by 31 March of the reference year, after obtaining approval from the Commission. In adopting the annual work plans, both PRIMA-IS and the Commission shall act without undue delay. PRIMA-IS shall make the annual work plan publicly available. 3. Activities referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 may be launched only in the reference year and only after the adoption of the annual work plan for that year. 4. If the annual work plan is adopted during the reference year, the Union financial contribution referred to in Article 3(1) may be used to reimburse the administrative costs of PRIMA-IS incurred from 1 January of that reference year in line with the annual work plan. However, the Union financial contribution referred to in Article 3(1) may reimburse administrative costs of PRIMA-IS incurred as from 7 August 2017 in line with the first annual work plan. 5. Activities may be funded under PRIMA only if they are set out in the annual work plan. The annual work plan shall distinguish between the activities referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the activities referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article and the administrative costs of PRIMA-IS. It shall provide for their corresponding expenditure estimates as well as for the budget allocation to activities funded with the Union financial contribution referred to in Article 3(1) and to activities funded by the Participating States without the Union financial contribution referred to in Article 3(1). The annual work plan shall also include the estimated value of the Participating States' in-kind contributions referred to in point (b) of Article 5(2). 6. Amended annual work plans for a reference year and annual work plans for subsequent reference years shall take into account the results of previous calls for proposals. They shall endeavour to address insufficient coverage of scientific topics in particular those initially addressed in activities under point (b) of paragraph 1 that could not be adequately funded. 7. The final activities to be funded, including the final calls for proposals under the relevant annual work plans shall be launched by 31 December 2024. In duly justified cases, they may be launched by 31 December 2025. 8. Activities to be funded by the Participating States without the Union financial contribution referred to in Article 3(1) may be included in the annual work plan only following the positive outcome of their external independent evaluation by international peer review with regard to the objectives of PRIMA, as organised by PRIMA-IS."
