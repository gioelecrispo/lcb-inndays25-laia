  "chunk_text": "This supports the outcome of Rio + 20, which recognises the need for broader measures of progress to measure well-being and sustainability to complement GDP. 84. In order to secure investment for environment and climate policy and address environmental externalities, the 7th EAP shall ensure that by 2020: (a) environment and climate policy objectives are achieved in a cost-effective way and are supported by adequate finance; (b) public and private sector funding for environment and climate-related expenditure is increased; (c) the value of natural capital and ecosystem services, as well as the costs of their degradation are properly assessed and considered in policy-making and investments. This requires, in particular: (i) phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies at Union and Member State level without delay, and reporting on progress through the National Reform Programmes; increasing the use of market-based instruments, such as Member States taxation policies, pricing and charging, and expanding markets for environmental goods and services, with due regard to any adverse social impacts, using an action-based approach, supported and monitored by the Commission, inter alia, via the European Semester; (ii) facilitating the development of, and access to, innovative financial instruments and funding for eco-innovation; (iii) adequately reflecting environment and climate priorities in policies and funding strategies to support economic, social and territorial cohesion; (iv) making dedicated efforts to ensure the full and efficient use of available Union funding for environmental action, including by significantly improving its early uptake under the Unions Multiannual Financial Framework 2014 Â“2020 and devoting 20 % of the budget to climate change mitigation and adaptation through the mainstreaming of climate action and linking that funding to clear benchmarks, target setting, monitoring and reporting; (v) developing and applying a system for reporting and tracking environment-related expenditure in the Union budget, in particular expenditure on climate change and biodiversity, by 2014; (vi) integrating environmental and climate-related considerations into the European Semester process, where this is relevant for individual Member States prospects for sustainable growth and is appropriate for country-specific recommendations; (vii) developing and applying alternative indicators that complement and go beyond GDP to monitor the sustainability of progress and continuing work to integrate economic indicators with environmental and social indicators, including by means of natural capital accounting; (viii) further developing and encouraging payments for ecosystem services schemes; (ix) putting in place incentives and methodologies that stimulate companies to measure the environmental costs of their business and profits derived from using environmental services and to disclose environmental information as part of their annual reporting. Encouraging companies to exercise due diligence, including throughout their supply chain. Priority objective 7: To improve environmental integration and policy coherence 85. Although integrating environmental protection concerns into other Union policies and activities has been a Treaty requirement since 1997, the overall state of Europes environment indicates that progress made to date, while commendable in some areas, has not been sufficient to reverse all negative trends."
