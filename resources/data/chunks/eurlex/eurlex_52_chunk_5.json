The assistance shall contribute to covering Ukraine's balance of payments needs as identified in the IMF programme. 2. The full amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be provided to Ukraine in the form of loans. The Commission shall be empowered on behalf of the Union to borrow the necessary funds on the capital markets or from financial institutions and to on-lend them to Ukraine. The loans shall have a maximum maturity of 15 years. 3. The release of the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be managed by the Commission in a manner consistent with the agreements or understandings reached between the IMF and Ukraine, and with the key principles and objectives of economic reforms set out in the Association Agreement and the EU-Ukraine Association Agenda agreed under the ENP. The Commission shall regularly inform the European Parliament and the Council of developments regarding the Union's macro-financial assistance, including disbursements thereof, and shall provide those institutions with the relevant documents in due time. 4. The Union's macro-financial assistance shall be made available for a period of two and a half years, starting from the day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding referred to in Article 3(1). 5. If the financing needs of Ukraine decrease fundamentally during the period of the disbursement of the Union's macro-financial assistance compared to the initial projections, the Commission shall, acting in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 7(2), reduce the amount of the assistance or suspend or cancel it. Article 2 1. A pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be that Ukraine respects effective democratic mechanisms  including a multi-party parliamentary system  and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. 2. The Commission and the European External Action Service shall monitor the fulfilment of this pre-condition throughout the life-cycle of the Union's macro-financial assistance. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be applied in accordance with Council Decision 2010/427/EU (7). Article 3 1. The Commission shall, in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 7(2), agree with the Ukrainian authorities on clearly defined economic policy and financial conditions, focusing on structural reforms and sound public finances, to which the Union's macro-financial assistance is to be subject, to be laid down in a Memorandum of Understanding (the Memorandum of Understanding) which shall include a timeframe for the fulfilment of those conditions. The economic policy and financial conditions set out in the Memorandum of Understanding shall be consistent with the agreements or understandings referred to in Article 1(3), including the macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform programmes implemented by Ukraine, with the support of the IMF."
