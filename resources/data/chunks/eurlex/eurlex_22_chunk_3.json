  "chunk_text": "However, this should not form part of the legal assessment of the Commission of the draft intergovernmental agreement or amendment. (10) In order to ensure compliance with Union law, and with due regard to the fact that intergovernmental agreements and amendments in the area of gas or oil currently have the largest relative repercussions on the proper functioning of the internal energy market and on the security of energy supply of the Union, Member States should, on an ex-ante basis, notify draft intergovernmental agreements relating to gas or oil to the Commission before they become legally binding on the parties. In a spirit of cooperation, the Commission should support the Member State in identifying compliance issues of the draft intergovernmental agreement or amendment. The Member State concerned would then be better prepared to conclude an agreement that complies with Union law. (11) The Commission should have sufficient time for such an assessment in order to provide for as much legal certainty as possible while avoiding undue delays. The Commission should consider shortening the periods that are provided for its assessment if appropriate, in particular if a Member State so requests or has kept the Commission informed in sufficient detail during the negotiations phase, and having regard to the extent to which the draft intergovernmental agreement or amendment is based on model clauses. In order to benefit fully from the Commission's support, Member States should refrain from concluding an intergovernmental agreement relating to gas or oil, or an intergovernmental agreement relating to electricity where a Member State has chosen to request ex-ante assessment by the Commission, until the Commission has informed the Member State of its assessment. The Member States should take all necessary steps to reach a suitable solution to eliminate any incompatibility identified. (12) In light of the Energy Union Strategy, transparency with regard to past and future intergovernmental agreements continues to be of upmost importance and is an important element in ensuring the Union's energy stability. Therefore, Member States should continue notifying to the Commission existing and future intergovernmental agreements, whether they have entered into force or are being applied provisionally within the meaning of Article 25 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and new intergovernmental agreements. (13) The Commission should assess the compatibility with Union law of intergovernmental agreements that are in force or apply provisionally on the date of entry into force of this Decision, and inform the Member States accordingly. In the event of incompatibility, Member States should take all necessary steps to reach a suitable solution to eliminate the incompatibility identified. (14) This Decision should apply to intergovernmental agreements. Intergovernmental agreements express, in particular in their content, and regardless of their formal designation, the intention of the parties that the agreement should have binding force, entirely or in part."
