  "chunk_text": "The work programme shall describe the national specific activities to be funded. Within that framework, Member States may define their own priorities and initiatives in accordance with Article 2 and may include OCTs where applicable. The application for co-financing shall be accompanied by a detailed budget setting out the total costs of the measures or work programme proposed, as well as the amount and sources of possible co-funding. The Union contribution may cover up to 80 % of the final costs of the activities. The Commission shall determine indicative amounts to be made available for co-financing to each national coordinator and the deadline for submission of the applications, based on criteria that take into account the population and the cost of living of the Member State concerned. A fixed amount per Member State shall guarantee a minimum level of activities. When determining that fixed amount, the Commission shall take into account the relatively short experience in development cooperation of those Member States that have joined the Union since 1 January 2004. The Commission shall also take into account measures submitted jointly or shared by several Member States. The Commission shall ensure a transparent, timely and efficient approval procedure based on the principles of equal treatment and sound financial management."
