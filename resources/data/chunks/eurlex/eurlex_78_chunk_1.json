(2) Successive environment action programmes have provided the framework for Union action in the field of the environment since 1973. (3) The Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (5) (6th EAP) ended in July 2012, but many measures and actions launched under that programme continue to be implemented. (4) The final assessment of the 6th EAP concluded that the programme delivered benefits for the environment and provided an overarching strategic direction for environment policy. Despite those achievements, unsustainable trends still persist in the four priority areas identified in the 6th EAP: climate change; nature and biodiversity; environment and health and quality of life; and natural resources and wastes. (5) The final assessment of the 6th EAP highlighted some shortcomings. The achievement of the objectives set out in the Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) therefore requires the full commitment of the Member States and the relevant Union institutions and the willingness to take responsibility for the delivery of the programmes intended benefits. (6) According to the report of the European Environment Agency entitled The European environment  state and outlook 2010 (SOER 2010) a number of major environmental challenges still remain, and serious repercussions will ensue if nothing is done to address them. (7) Global systemic trends and challenges, related to population dynamics, urbanisation, disease and pandemics, accelerating technological change and unsustainable economic growth add to the complexity of tackling environmental challenges and achieving long-term sustainable development. Ensuring the Unions long-term prosperity requires taking further action to address those challenges. (8) It is essential that Union priority objectives for 2020 are established, in line with a clear long-term vision for 2050."
