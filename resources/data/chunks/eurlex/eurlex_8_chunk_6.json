The detailed financial terms of the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be laid down in a loan agreement and a grant agreement to be concluded between the Commission and the Georgian authorities. 4. The Commission shall verify, at regular intervals, that the conditions referred to in Article 4(3) continue to be met, including whether the economic policies of Georgia are in accordance with the objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance. In so doing, the Commission shall coordinate closely with the IMF and the World Bank, and, where necessary, with the European Parliament and the Council. Article 4 1. Subject to the conditions referred to in paragraph 3, the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be made available by the Commission in two instalments, each of which shall consist of a loan and a grant element. The size of each instalment shall be laid down in the Memorandum of Understanding. 2. The amount of the Union's macro-financial assistance provided in the form of loans shall be provisioned, where required, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 (5). 3. The Commission shall decide on the release of the instalments subject to the fulfilment of all of the following conditions: (a) the pre-condition set out in Article 2(1); (b) a continuous satisfactory track record of implementing a policy programme that contains strong adjustment and structural reform measures supported by a non-precautionary IMF credit arrangement; and (c) the satisfactory implementation of the economic policy and financial conditions agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding. The release of the second instalment shall not, in principle, take place earlier than three months after the release of the first instalment. 4. Where the conditions referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 are not met, the Commission shall temporarily suspend or cancel the disbursement of the Union's macro-financial assistance. In such cases, it shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of the reasons for that suspension or cancellation. 5. The Union's macro-financial assistance shall be disbursed to the National Bank of Georgia. Subject to the provisions to be agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding, including a confirmation of residual budgetary financing needs, the Union funds may be transferred to the Georgian Ministry of Finance as the final beneficiary. Article 5 1. The borrowing and lending operations related to the loan component of the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be carried out in euro using the same value date and shall not involve the Union in the transformation of maturities, or expose it to any exchange or interest rate risk, or to any other commercial risk. 2. Where the circumstances permit, and if Georgia so requests, the Commission may take the steps necessary to ensure that an early repayment clause is included in the loan terms and conditions and that it is matched by a corresponding clause in the terms and conditions of the borrowing operations."
