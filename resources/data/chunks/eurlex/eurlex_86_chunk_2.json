  "chunk_text": "(8) The Union allocated, for 2010-2012, under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), budget support grants to Georgia of, on average, EUR 24 million per year. (9) In view of Georgias deteriorating economic situation and outlook, it has requested Union macro-financial assistance. (10) Given that there is still a residual financing gap in Georgias balance of payments, macro-financial assistance is considered an appropriate response to Georgias request under the current exceptional circumstances to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the current IMF programme. (11) The Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Georgia (the Unions macro-financial assistance) should not merely supplement programmes and resources from the IMF and the World Bank, but should ensure the added value of Union involvement. (12) The Commission should ensure that the Unions macro-financial assistance is legally and substantially in line with the measures taken within the different areas of external action and other relevant Union policies. (13) The specific objectives of the Unions macro-financial assistance should strengthen efficiency, transparency and accountability. Those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission. (14) The conditions underlying the provision of the Unions macro-financial assistance should reflect the key principles and objectives of the Unions policy towards Georgia. (15) In order to ensure efficient protection of the Unions financial interests linked to the Unions macro-financial assistance, it is necessary that Georgia adopt appropriate measures relating to the prevention of, and the fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to that assistance. It is also necessary that the Commission provide for appropriate checks and that the Court of Auditors provide for appropriate audits. (16) The release of the Unions macro-financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority. (17) The Unions macro-financial assistance should be managed by the Commission. In order to ensure that the European Parliament and the Economic and Financial Committee are able to follow the implementation of this Decision, the Commission should regularly inform them of developments relating to the Unions macro-financial assistance and provide them with relevant documents. (18) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commissions exercise of implementing powers (3). (19) In this context, it is recalled that in the terms of that Regulation the advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as provided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially important impact of the operations superior to the threshold of EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the examination procedure is used for these operations."
