(2) The EGF is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices), as laid down in Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (3). (3) On 19 June 2015, Ireland submitted an application EGF/2015/006 IE/PWA International for a financial contribution from the EGF, following redundancies in PWA International Ltd and one supplier in Ireland. It was supplemented by additional information provided in accordance with Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013. That application complies with the requirements for determining a financial contribution from the EGF in accordance with Article 13 of that Regulation. (4) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013, Ireland has decided to provide personalised services co-financed by the EGF also to 108 young persons not in employment, education or training (NEETs). (5) In accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013, the application from Ireland is considered admissible since the redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national economy. (6) The EGF should, therefore, be mobilised in order to provide a financial contribution of EUR 442 293 in respect of the application submitted by Ireland. (7) In order to minimise the time taken to mobilise the EGF, this decision should apply from the date of its adoption, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1"
