If\nvictimization occurred in a non-BOP setting, staff should document information, and\nappropriate psychological treatment and monitoring will be provided if needed. ■ Inmates with a history of sexual predation. When, during the intake screening process,\nstaff identify inmates with a history of sexual predation (e.g., from self-report or from review\nof available documents such as judgment and commitment orders, criminal records, presentence investigation reports, Inmate Central File data, etc.), staff must refer the inmate to\nPsychology Services.

The Unit Team uses the Intake Screening Form\nduring the intake process. To complete the Intake Screening Form, the staff must use the PREA Intake Objective Screening\nInstrument, Attachment A, for guidance.

OFFICIAL RESPONSE FOLLOWING AN INMATE REPORT\n§ 115.61 Staff and agency reporting duties. (a) The agency shall require all staff to report immediately and according to\nagency policy any knowledge, suspicion, or information regarding an incident of\nsexual abuse or sexual harassment that occurred in a facility, whether or not it is\npart of the agency; retaliation against inmates or staff who reported such an\nincident; and any staff neglect or violation of responsibilities that may have\ncontributed to an incident or retaliation. All staff must report information concerning incidents or possible incidents of sexual abuse or\nsexual harassment to the Operations Lieutenant, or, where appropriate, in accordance with the\nProgram Statement Standards of Employee Conduct. Staff provide a written follow-up memorandum to the Operations Lieutenant to document such a\nreport, in accordance with Article 6 of the Master Agreement. The Operations Lieutenant notifies the PREA Compliance Manager. Allegations of inmate-on-inmate and inmate-on-staff sexual abuse must be entered in\nTRUINTEL via the Report of Incident form (BP-A0583). Reports must indicate whether the\nallegation involved Abusive Sexual Contact or a Non-Consensual Sexual Act. The Institution\nPREA Compliance Manager will forward a copy of the BP-A0583 to the appropriate Regional\nPREA Coordinator; the number of BP-A0583’s that pertain to inmate-on-inmate and inmate-onstaff sexual abuse will be sent to the National PREA Coordinator. Once reported, an evaluation by the Institution PREA Compliance Manager of whether a full\nresponse protocol is needed will be made (see section 115.65). In addition to reporting information, staff intervene as appropriate (e.g., writing an incident\nreport), in behaviors that may subsequently lead to an incident of sexual abuse. Staff should be aware of the following in determining what information to report:\nDetection requires an awareness by staff of institution or unit climate and the reputations and\nbehaviors of inmates – through actively paying attention to the following, for example: P5324.12 6/4/2015 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 37 ■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■ Inmate communications. Comments to staff. Posted picture files, and Correctional Services “confidentials.”\nInmate interactions. Changes in inmate behavior (eating, sleeping, hygiene, work habits, etc.). Isolated or “hot” areas of the institution. By observing factors such as these, staff are able to better detect sexually abusive behavior, and\npossibly deter problems before they occur, or before they escalate. (b) Apart from reporting to designated supervisors or officials, staff shall not\nreveal any information related to a sexual abuse report to anyone other than to\nthe extent necessary, as specified in agency policy, to make treatment,\ninvestigation, and other security and management decisions. The information concerning the identity of the alleged inmate victim and the specific facts of the\ncase are limited to staff who need to know because of their involvement with the victim’s\nwelfare and the investigation of the incident. This is important not only to preserve the victim’s\nprivacy but to preserve maximum flexibility to investigate the allegations. It is appropriate under\nthis section to forward reports to the Operations Lieutenant through the staff member’s\nsupervisor."

If an inmate perpetrator is determined in need of treatment services and refuses treatment,\nPsychology Services staff document the refusal, place it in the medical section of the Inmate\nCentral File, and notify referring staff of the refusal. Documentation of treatment compliance or\nrefusal ensures continuity of care within and outside the Bureau.\n(c) If the screening pursuant to § 115.41 indicates that a jail inmate has\nexperienced prior sexual victimization, whether it occurred in an institutional\nsetting or in the community, staff shall ensure that the inmate is offered a followup meeting with a medical or mental health practitioner within 14 days of the\nintake screening.

(a) Inmate victims of sexual abuse shall receive timely, unimpeded access to\nemergency medical treatment and crisis intervention services, the nature and\nscope of which are determined by medical and mental health practitioners\naccording to their professional judgment. See section 115.65 for details concerning emergency mental health services. Procedures for Inmate Victims. Medical staff are responsible for examination, documentation,\nand treatment of inmate injuries arising from sexually abusive behaviors, including testing when\nappropriate for pregnancy and sexually transmissible infections (STIs), including HIV. When an inmate self-reports, or is referred to Health Services, medical staff notify Psychology\nServices and Correctional Services prior to conducting an injury assessment. The injury\nassessment, and the inmate’s subjective/objective findings, are documented fully in the\nelectronic health record. Health Services staff perform the injury assessment without\ncompromising forensic evidence. The forensic examination is performed by qualified sexual assault examiners (e.g., Sexual\nAssault Nurse Examiner, Forensic Nurse Examiner, or Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner). Where indicated, Health Services staff with appropriate qualifications may conduct a forensic\nexamination at the institution. At institutions where Health Services staff are neither trained nor\ncertified in forensic examinations, the inmate is examined at the institution by a qualified health\ncare professional from the community, or at a local community facility (e.g., local hospital or\nrape crisis center) equipped to conduct such examinations. The forensic examination should\noccur as soon as practicable, but within 72 hours of BOP staff becoming aware that an inmate\nreported involvement in a sexually abusive assault. An inmate’s refusal of a forensic\nexamination is documented in the electronic health record. If a trip to a local community facility is needed, Health Services staff coordinate with\nCorrectional Services to transport the inmate to the facility. When community care is completed, institution providers render follow-up care, including\nscreening for infectious disease (HIV, viral hepatitis, or other sexually transmissible infections),\npregnancy testing for female victims, and administration of prophylactic medication (if exposure\nto bloodborne pathogens is suspected) if these services were not already rendered during the\ncommunity visit.
