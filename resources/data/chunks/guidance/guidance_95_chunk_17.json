  "chunk_text": "If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate or draw down federal funds under\nyour agency’s COPS Office award until you comply with federal civil rights laws or cooperate with any ongoing\nfederal civil rights investigation. What you should do:\nIncluded with your award package is a memorandum from the Office for Civil Rights, Office of Justice Programs, US\nDepartment of Justice, which addresses the Federal civil rights statutes and regulations applicable to your award. You should review this memorandum to understand your agency’s civil rights responsibilities. As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the applicable\nfederal civil rights laws and to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective enforcement of such laws\nand to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes providing access to records, accounts,\ndocuments, information, facilities, and staff. 11. Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP)\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the US Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus Crime\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that funds the COPS Office, that “the full and\nequal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal justice system\nis a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act’s program to reduce crime and delinquency in the United States”\n(28 C.F.R. § 42.301). EEOPs do not impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization’s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private business and has received a single award for $25,000 or\nmore and has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but excluding political\nappointees), then it has to prepare a Utilization Report and submit it to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within 120\ndays from the date of the award. Although the OCR has discretion to review all submitted Utilization Reports, it will\nreview the Utilization Reports from recipients that receive an award of $500,000 or more. 15 2017 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual To begin developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nhttps://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click EEOP Reporting Tool Login. Additional assistance can\nbe found online at the bottom of the same webpage by clicking the EEO Reporting Tool Job Aid and Frequently\nAsked Questions. If your organization has less than fifty employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the EEOP\nrequirement."
