If your agency is authorized to make subawards\nunder its award, your agency may make subawards only to entities that have DUNS numbers. For more\ninformation about your DUNS number, please contact D&B using the toll-free number 866-705-5711 or visit\nhttp://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. Your agency must maintain active registration and current information in the SAM until you submit the final\nfinancial report or receive the final payment under your award, whichever is later. Your agency must review and\nupdate its SAM information at least once per year to maintain an active registration status.
