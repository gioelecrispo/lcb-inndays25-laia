Kane\nActing Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons This Change Notice (CN) implements the following change to Program Statement 5800.15,\nCorrectional Systems Manual, dated January 1, 2009. This CN provides guidance pertaining to\nthe Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and the\nDepartment of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The deleted\ntext (in Section 606) is marked with a highlight. The inserted text is marked in bold. 606. PRE-RELEASE NOTIFICATION No later than 90 calendar days before the inmate’s release, CS staff will notify the agency that\nplaced a detainer or notification, usually via a DAL or letter, of the inmate’s projected release\ndate. The authority that filed a detainer must notify the institution of its intent to take custody\nof the inmate. It is the responsibility of the agency placing the detainer to arrange with local\nlaw enforcement authorities when the need for an extradition hearing arises. If the requesting authority indicates in writing it will not take custody of the inmate, a DAL\nwill be completed and forwarded, the detainer will be removed, the warrant will be returned,\nand the institution may continue with release planning. The unit team will be notified of the removal of all detainers via DAL. If the detainer is\nremoved within one month of release, the unit team will be notified of the action without delay\n(ordinarily within the same business day). If the filing authority has indicated it will take custody, but on the day of scheduled release\nchooses not to, it is requested that the filing authority provide written documentation of its\nintent. (A faxed copy is adequate, however, CS staff must verify the document and file it in the\nJ&C file.) If the filing authority cannot provide written documentation, telephonic verification will\nbe accepted and documented accordingly. In either case, the inmate will be released to the\ncommunity provided no other detainer has been lodged against the inmate. If multiple detainers have been filed, with the exception of federal detainers, custody will be\noffered first to the earliest lodged detainer. All jurisdictions that have lodged detainers are to\nbe notified of the detaining authority taking custody at release to allow those jurisdictions to\nre-file their detainer(s) with the agency taking custody of the inmate. Federal detainers, excluding ICE deportation matters, will take priority over nonFederal detainers. Normally, ICE will not accept custody of an inmate until all state and Federal criminal\nmatters have been satisfied. Immigration Detainers The following language refers to ALL ICE detainers. If an inmate has a federal detainer and an immigration detainers on file, custody will be\ngiven to the federal law enforcement agency first. If an inmate has an immigration\ndetainer and a non-federal detainer on file, ICE will be offered custody first. CS staff will notify ICE of all inmates who have an immigration detainer at least ninety\n(90) days prior to the inmate’s projected release date, or as soon as staff becomes aware of\nthe detainer."

CS staff will send a DAL, release notifications, copies of all federal and nonfederal detainers, and pertinent information to the ICE Pacific Response Center (PERC),\nvia email, at the following email address: bopreleases@ice.dhs.gov. At the time of notification, ICE will be provided with the inmate's medical and mental\nhealth care level. For inmates identified as Medical Health Care Level 3 or 4, and/or\nMental Health Care Level 3 or 4, a Health Services Exit Summary and/or a Psychology\nServices Mental Health Transfer Summary will be provided in an encrypted electronic\ncopy to the above-mentioned email address. These summaries will include, at a minimum,\na list of medications, any required medical and nursing care and/or treatment, medical\nequipment requirements, ability to conduct activities of daily living, and plan of care. The\nCMC or SCSS will ensure this information and these documents are submitted to ICE. Upon request, CS staff will provide ICE's medical staff at the ICE Enforcement and\nRemoval Operations (ERO) field office with an encrypted electronic copy of the inmate’s\nmedical record, including the most recent lab work and diagnostic tests (e.g., x-rays, MRI,\nCT scan) for any current health problems. The encrypted electronic copy should be sent to\nthe ICE ERO field office requesting the information. ICE will notify CS staff 60 days prior to the PRD, or as soon as possible, of its decision to\nassume or decline custody of the inmate. If ICE declines custody, CS staff may transfer\ncustody of the inmate to the law enforcement agency who lodged a detainer, or release the\ninmate if no other detainer is on file. If ICE declines to accept custody, the responsible ICE\nERO field office must cancel the detainer by checking the appropriate box on the\napplicable detainer and notify CS staff. Once CS staff receives this notification, a DAL\nmust be completed and sent to ICE in order to remove the immigration detainer.

STAFF TRAINING\n201. INTRODUCTION Training is vitally important for staff growth and development. Numerous training aids are\navailable for staff, to include, but not limited to on-the-job training (OJT), mentoring, classroom\ninstruction, training modules, computer-based training, videos, etc. Managers/supervisors have a responsibility to ensure staff receive adequate training to meet the\nchallenges of their job and to prepare them for future advancement. For training purposes, the agency agrees to comply with all national policies and the Master\nAgreement. Consistent with this, training will be provided to those employees not previously\ntrained in the functional areas of the CSO position (i.e., Records Office, R&D, and Mail Room). 202. STAFF ORIENTATION The training process starts when a new employee reports for duty. It is important that staff\nreceive an overview of the department’s components and mission, including but not limited to:\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■ Sentence computation and administration of good time. IADA, writs, and movement. Preparation of release paperwork. Proper handling and accountability of inmate mail. Property. Proper handling of monies and legal instruments. Managers/Supervisors are required to develop an orientation program that, is conducted as soon\nas is practicable, and at a minimum, consists of the following components:\n■ Introduction of the new employee to their administration, co-workers, and other staff as\nrequired.\n■ A five-day orientation program. ■ Assignment to an experienced employee in each functional area to provide guidance on\nduties. ■ Introduction to the reference library, or use of the Sallyport Policy/Forms Intranet website,\nwith a listing of all relevant policies provided. CSD staff should be knowledgeable of all policy applicable to Correctional Systems. The\nmanager/supervisor has a responsibility to ensure training is conducted. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 2, Page 1 203. MANDATORY TRAINING All CSD staff must complete all of the self-study training modules successfully within nine\nmonths of appointment. The manager/supervisor will coordinate a schedule and provide on-duty\ntime for completing the modules.

NAME OF MODULES\nMail Management\nDetainers, Writs and IAD\nProcessing Inmates In-Out\nSentence Computation/Judgment and Commitment File\nA minimum score of 75% must be achieved to pass each module. If a passing score is not\nattained, the employee may retake the module one more time without additional study. If a\npassing score is not attained on the second attempt, the manager/supervisor will prescribe\nadditional training and study. Note: If the employee fails to receive a passing score after the second attempt, at least 30 days\nmust elapse between each subsequent attempt with additional training during this time. When the employee completes all modules successfully, a copy must be forwarded to the\nEmployee Services Manager (ESM) for documentation and posting to the official training record. Sixteen hours of training credit will be given for each completed module. Additionally, all CSD staff must complete the Mail Room Officer’s and the Receiving and\nDischarge Officer’s Self-Study Course and Survival Skills Guides within nine months of\nappointment. This training will be completed during on-duty time. Staff will be required to be Central Inmate Monitoring (CIM) certified in accordance with the\nCIM Manual, and National Crime Information Center (NCIC) certified. Specific training requirements for the CSD are outlined in the Employee Development Manual. Staff will not be nominated to attend specialty training until they have completed all of the CSD\nself-study training modules. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 2, Page 2 204. LOCAL CSD TRAINING Each manager/supervisor has a responsibility to provide and monitor localized training for their\nstaff. In carrying out these responsibilities, each manager/supervisor will develop local training\nmaterials to help staff perform their assigned duties. Upon request, the Correctional Programs\nDivision, Central Office, will provide training materials and assist in developing local training. The manager/supervisor will maintain all training records. All training must be documented in\naccordance with the Employee Development Manual. 205. INDIVIDUAL TRAINING PLANS A large part of the manager/supervisor’s responsibility lies in staff development. To ensure staff\ntraining needs are adequately met, each manager/supervisor is to evaluate the needs of their staff\nin accordance with the Employee Development Manual. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 2, Page 3 CHAPTER 3. CORRECTIONAL SYSTEMS POPULATION ACCOUNTABILITY\n& FILE MANAGEMENT\n301. DEFINITION AND RESPONSIBILITIES The Bureau maintains confinement-related documents on all inmates and detainees committed to\nits authority. The Records Office maintains the records of each inmate admitted to or discharged from the\ninstitution. The manager is the Custodian of Records and is responsible for file retrieval, transfer, retention,\ndisposal, certification, production, and disclosure. 302. POPULATION INDEX SYSTEM The maintenance of an alphabetical index card system for all inmates processed into or out of the\ninstitution is not required if a database system is used to document file retirement. The inactive\ncards currently on file will be kept for archiving purposes. In the event a database system is\ndeveloped or used, the local Union will negotiate in accordance with the Master Agreement."

In the event a database system is\ndeveloped or used, the local Union will negotiate in accordance with the Master Agreement. Upon commitment, index cards such as quarters’ cards, crew kit cards, Warden’s cards, etc., may\nbe produced in any format. 303. INMATE REMAND AND JUDGMENT & COMMITMENT (J&C) FILES The CSD creates and maintains Inmate Remand and J&C files. ■ The Inmate Remand file (BP-676) is a drop-file folder that may be used for documents\npertaining to pretrial and holdover inmates. ■ The J&C file (BP-174) is a folder marked “Sensitive But Unclassified” which contains\ndocuments relating to sentenced inmates. Due to the sensitive nature of information contained within these files, the front of each file will\nbe stamped “Sensitive But Unclassified.” Disclosure of information contained in these files must\nbe in accordance with the Program Statement on Release of Information. A copy of most documents contained in the J&C file are available in the central file, and\ntherefore, inmates requesting to review the J&C file will be referred to the unit team. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 3, Page 1 CSD staff may allow inmates to review portions of the J&C file when discussing sentence\ncomputations or detainer issues, unless documents are sealed by the court or otherwise nondisclosable. If clarification of disclosable information is needed, CSD staff must contact their assigned legal\nrepresentative. Inmates are to submit requests for additional access to information or copies of file materials\nthrough regular Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) procedures. Local instructions will be established at each institution to implement this procedure. For security and safekeeping purposes, Inmate Remand, J&C, and holdover files will be stored\nalphabetically in locked cabinets, secured file room, or filing systems when not in use. The file\ncabinets are to be located in a central area for easy access. J&C files of designated inmates will be physically accounted for quarterly (this procedure is also\nrecommended for Remand files). A SENTRY generated roster of the institution’s designated\ninmate population will be used to verify each file. Once completed, the reviewing CSD staff\nmember will sign and date the roster. It is to be maintained for two years. 304. ORGANIZATION OF THE INMATE JUDGMENT & COMMITMENT (J&C)\nFILE\nRefer to Attachment A for the organization of the J&C file. Each document within its same subset will be filed chronologically from bottom to top with the\nmost recent document on top. The most recent sentence computation and good time action sheet, certified, dated, and audited,\nwill be maintained in the J&C file. Prior copies must be kept if they provide a history leading to\nthe most recent computation. History may include jail credit, modified parole eligibility dates,\nviolator computations, changes in sentence structure, or satisfied prior commitments. All material relating to the original sentence computation and previous violator terms for which\nthe violator term was imposed, including the original fingerprint card, will be retained in the J&C\nfile. All other excess prior commitment documents will be forwarded to the unit team for review\nand possible inclusion in the inmate central file."

PRODUCTION OF RECORDS IN COURT Procedures governing the production of records in court may be found in 28 CFR 16.21 Subpart\nB. Approval for production or disclosure is by the Attorney General or other appropriate\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) personnel. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 3, Page 2 CSD staff who receive a subpoena, order, or other court demand to produce CSD records are\nencouraged to seek advice from their assigned legal representative, local U.S. Attorney’s office,\nand from the Regional Counsel or Office of General Counsel prior to processing. Questions concerning disclosable information may be directed to their assigned legal\nrepresentative. When it is known that records will be required for introduction into evidence, copies must be\nprepared in advance to deliver to the court. Inmate files will not leave the custody of the person\nsubpoenaed to produce the records. 306. TRANSFER OF INMATE FILES All requests for inmate files from Bureau facilities, will use a Bureau approved e-mail system. Upon receiving a request for the permanent withdrawal of an inmate file, CSD staff will verify\nthe requesting person’s identity prior to fulfilling the request, unless the request is sent via e-mail\nfrom another Bureau facility. Such requests will contain the requestor’s mailing address. CSD staff will note on the back of the 3 x 5 inactive card, or in a database system, the requesting\nfacility, the date the file was mailed and the shipping tracking number. Files sent between Bureau or contract facilities, or to CCM offices, must be sent by trackable\nmail with signature confirmation. Local procedures should be established for receipt and\nprocessing of trackable mail other than United States Postal Service deliveries. For temporary withdrawal requests, other than through a Bureau approved e-mail system, the\nfollowing information will be documented in accordance with local procedures:\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■ How the request was made (telephonic, written, etc.). Date. Name of person contacted to verify requestor. Name of CSD staff person conducting the verification. Inmate’s name. Register number. Address where the file is being sent.

P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 3, Page 3 Requests for inmate files from a U.S. Attorney must be referred to the appropriate assigned legal\nrepresentative for determination. If the assigned legal representative grants approval to mail a file to a U.S. Attorney, the file will\nbe sent via trackable mail with signature confirmation. The U.S. Attorney will be notified that the file is not to be released to anyone, that they are\nassuming full responsibility for its integrity and safekeeping, and they must return it to the\nsending institution.

A copy of fingerprint card. A copy of J&C (if not sealed). A Certificate of Record (BP-A396). The manager will sign as the Custodian of Records under the authority of 18 U.S.C. § 4004. CSD\nstaff are authorized to witness the manager’s signature. If the inmate’s central file has been archived, CSD staff will request the file from the FRC,\nprocess the “pen packet,” and then return the file. Records are to be examined carefully for completeness prior to copying. For those jurisdictions\nthat require special seals or certifications, local procedures are to be established.

(Refer to the Program Statement,\nSecurity Designation and Custody Classification Manual for more information.)\nb. Sentence and Commitment Documents. Documents not received at the DSCC will be\nforwarded on to the DSCC and the unit team, i.e., NOAs, J&C modifications, court orders, state\njudgments, Title 18 U.S.C § 3621(e) documentation (in accordance with policy), etc.\nc. Verifying Court Orders. Except for the initial J&C, the authenticity of court orders (i.e.,\namended J&C’s not affecting sentence computations, state and Federal writs, etc.) must be\nconfirmed before the ordered action is taken. Court orders that impact sentence computations\nmust be verified by DSCC. Any court order received through the U.S. Marshals Service need not be verified. Orders received\nthrough any other method must be verified as follows:\n■ Telephone the clerk of the court of issuance to verify the order and its exact language. If the\nclerk is unavailable, telephone the Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) or USPO in the district of\nissuance. ■ Verify the inmate’s committed name, docket number, and date of order. Note on the J&C the\ndate verified, name, title, and telephone number of the verifying person, and signature of the\nCSD staff making the inquiry. ■ Ensure the order contains the court’s seal, the clerk’s signature, and the judge’s signature.

The name entered on the J&C is\nconsidered the committed name to be used by the inmate, as well as the Bureau. SENTRY must\nreflect the committed name, which may only be changed by an order from the Federal sentencing\ncourt. Court orders will be filed in the J&C file in accordance with Attachment A of this Manual\nand the DSCC will be notified accordingly. Some orders/documents indicate “legal” names or “true” names in addition to the committed\nnames used in the criminal case. A SENTRY code for “legal” name has been established and the\nSENTRY “legal” name field must be updated accordingly. A “true” name will be entered into\nSENTRY as an alias. Additionally, inmates may adopt name changes in accordance with religious affiliations or other\nlawful means. It is the inmate’s responsibility to provide CSD staff with verifiable\ndocumentation of the name change which will be entered by staff in the SENTRY “legal” name\nfield. Names that are inflammatory and contrary to the institution’s security or orderly operation are not\nacceptable. When a religious name is questionable, consult with the institution Chaplain. e. Fines, Costs, and Restitution. The manager/supervisor is responsible for coordinating\nadministrative procedures required of the Bureau to process the release of inmates with satisfied\nor unsatisfied fines and/or costs. (For any fines and costs related to old law sentences, refer to\nthe Program Statement on Fines and Costs.) Inmates wishing to satisfy fines, costs or restitution must contact unit staff. CSD staff must verify with unit staff that inmates with fines agree in writing to establish a\npayment schedule with the court prior to being released to a period of supervised release (Title 18\nU.S.C. § 3624(e)). A copy of the agreement will be retained in the J&C file. An agreement to\nadhere to a payment schedule is not required when the fine has already been paid prior to release. A copy of the SENTRY PDIF transaction, filed in the J&C file, is acceptable proof of payment. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 4, Page 2 Violators who had a financial obligation imposed on the original sentence will continue to have\nthe fine or restitution on the violator term unless there is documentation indicating that it has\nbeen paid or the court has removed or waived it. CSD staff will notify the U.S. Attorney in the sentencing district of any inmate released with a\nfine that has not been paid in full. This notification will be on the Notice to U.S. Attorney of\nRelease of Inmate With Criminal Fine Judgment (BP-A384). A “new law” inmate who refuses to set up a payment plan with the Probation Officer through his\nor her unit team and does not have supervision to follow will be released from custody. However, a “new law” inmate will not be released if there is supervision to follow and the inmate\nrefuses to agree to adhere to an installment payment schedule."

PROCESS OF HABEAS ACTIONS Once the Administrative Remedy process has been exhausted, the inmate may file a petition for\nrelief with the Federal court. Usually, the court issues a show cause order requiring Bureau staff\nto appear and present to the court the reason(s) why the relief should not be granted. In some\ncases a declaration is required. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 4, Page 3 It is critical for the manager/supervisor to work closely with their assigned legal representative\nand the U.S. Attorney to ensure responses are prepared appropriately and filed by the deadline(s)\nset by the court. The manager/supervisor is often called upon to represent the institution in court proceedings to\ntestify in support of sentence computations, commitment authority, or chain of custody. As a witness, the manager/supervisor must be thoroughly prepared on every detail of the case in\nwhich testimony is expected. Meetings with the AUSA prior to giving testimony are encouraged. 404. CONTRACT PRISONERS Contract prisoners are those inmates who are committed to Bureau institutions for other than\nviolations of the U.S. Code. When an inmate is returned to permanent state custody, the last institution of confinement will\nterminate the state billing assignment and release the prisoner via “STATE PRIS.” P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 4, Page 4 CHAPTER 5. DSCC FUNCTIONS\n501. INITIAL REVIEW OF DESIGNATION PACKET\nDSCC staff must thoroughly review all sentencing and designation material. The review\nincludes, but is not limited to, jail credit, over-served time, separatee, medical, PSI, and J&C\ninformation. 502. SENTENCE COMPUTATIONS AND AUDITS The DSCC is to ensure that a SENTRY Monitoring Update Judgment/Warrant transaction is\nperformed on all designated inmates within 48 hours of receipt of the complete packet (excluding\nweekends and holidays). An inmate’s sentence must be computed and audited immediately if the inmate is within 30 days\nof the statutory release date and within five working days if the inmate is within six months or\nless of the statutory release date."

For terms in excess of six months from the statutory release\ndate, the sentence must be computed and audited within 30 calendar days. The Chief, DSCC, will determine the assignment of auditing sentence computations by relying\non staff experience and training. SENTRY will automatically capture the electronic ID of staff computing sentences at initial\ncomputation or subsequent updates. The final auditor will certify the computation in SENTRY. DSCC staff will monitor and update Good Time Data on a daily basis. Any documentation to\nsupport the changes in the Good Time Data sheet will be forwarded (i.e., facsimile,\nelectronically) by the approving official to the DSCC and unit team. Note: All military and Coast Guard sentence computations will be provided by the Records\nOffice, U.S. Army Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The Bureau must accept the sentence computation as provided by military authorities and refer\nsuspected errors, or challenges to the sentence computation, to the U.S. Army Disciplinary\nBarracks, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

When applicable, the DSCC will ensure all necessary files are requested and\nreceived (see Section 309). A SENTRY Sentence Monitoring Independent Sentence\nComputation will be done on all types of parole and mandatory release violators upon receipt of\npertinent documents. The Independent Sentence Computation must include credit for all street time, with the exception\nof D.C. Code offenders, in order to project the inmate’s Tentative Release Date (TRD) which\nwill be entered on to the Security Designation Load Data. If the results show an imminent or overdue release date, the U.S. Parole Commission (USPC) is\nto be notified and a copy of the Independent Sentence Computation documented and filed. The Independent Sentence Computation will then be included in the inmate’s designation packet,\nprovided he/she is not an immediate release. DSCC staff will calculate the violator term within five working days from the date the Notice of\nAction (NOA) is received from the USPC.

In some cases, a court will enter an order that is contrary to the Bureau’s statutory interpretation. If the order involves the awarding of jail credit, DSCC staff must perform an Independent\nSentence Computation based on the J&C and one based upon Bureau’s statutory interpretation. Supervisory staff will be consulted for guidance.

Refer to the sentence computation manuals for\nmore information on 5G1.3. If the order does not involve the awarding of jail credit, the Bureau must calculate the sentence\nbased on the court order and then write a letter to the prosecuting AUSA, with a courtesy copy to\nthe U.S. Probation Officer (USPO), seeking clarification from the court. The DSCC will prepare a letter, for the Chief’s signature, and it must:\n■ Include the inmate’s committed name, register number, docket number, and other pertinent\ninformation relating to the case. ■ Convey to the AUSA that the Bureau is seeking assistance to clarify the Court’s order. A copy of the letter will be forwarded to the DSCC Attorney for comment prior to submission to\nthe AUSA. A copy will also be placed in the J&C file for documentation.

CONTRACT PRISONERS Contract prisoners are those inmates who are committed to Bureau institutions for other than\nviolations of the U.S. Code. The DSCC Designator creates a billing assignment when a Bureau institution is designated for\nD.C., state, or territorial inmates. For previously billable inmates, the Designator will remove the\nassignment if it no longer applies and was not removed at the time of release. (All D.C. inmates\nwill have the billing assignment of NBL DC.) Billing disputes concerning any contract prisoner\nwill be referred to the DSCC. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 5, Page 5 CHAPTER 6. DETAINERS, INTERSTATE AGREEMENT ON DETAINERS,\nFOREIGN DETAINERS AND WRITS\n601. INTRODUCTION The Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IADA) allows the disposal of detainers lodged\nagainst inmates by jurisdictions in states that are party to the agreement. Either an inmate or a state may initiate proceedings for this purpose. Under the IADA, a jurisdiction having an untried indictment, information, or complaint lodged\nas a detainer may secure temporary custody of the inmate for trial. 602. DEFINITIONS\na. Detainer. A formal request from a Federal, state, or local jurisdiction for an inmate’s\ncustody upon completion of a term of imprisonment. This definition includes requests for\ncriminal and non-criminal charges (e.g., material witnesses, deportation, probation/parole\nviolator warrants, child support, etc.). b. Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IADA). A statutory provision authorizing\n“party states” to enter an agreement, for the disposition of “untried” charges, indictments,\ninformations, or complaints which form the basis of a detainer. The agreement applies to all detainers based on pending charges lodged against an inmate by a\n“party state” no matter when the detainer was lodged. The IADA does not apply to probation/parole violators (see Carchman v. Nash, 473 U.S. 716,\n105 S.Ct. 340, 87 L.Ed.2d 516 (1985)). c. Charge."

Notify. A formal request from a Federal, state, or local jurisdiction for notification before an\ninmate's release from a term of imprisonment. e. Party State. The United States of America, the District of Columbia, and any U.S. state or\nterritory that has codified the IADA into its statutes. The states of Louisiana, Mississippi, the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories or possessions have not joined the IADA to\ndate. (Refer to Appendix II, Title 18 U.S. Code.) P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 6, Page 1 603. DETAINER ACTIONS\na. Correctional Systems Department Review. CSD staff must review the FBI RAP sheet\nand the PSI to learn the existence of any possible pending charges or sentences. When possible, pending charges or sentences are indicated, CSD staff will initiate an inquiry by\nsending a Detainer Action Letter (BP-A394) (DAL) to the appropriate officials, usually the\nSheriff or Prosecuting Attorney. The manager or designee must sign the DAL. All DAL requests should include a business reply\nenvelope. Note: FBI Rap Sheets are requested when an inmate arrives at his/her initial designation. Additional information may be obtained by submitting an NCIC request. If no response was received, a second and final DAL will be sent within one year of release. Local procedures must be established to ensure the second DAL is sent in a timely manner for all\nunanswered detainer inquiries. A copy will be placed in the J&C file. Copies will also be\nforwarded to the appropriate unit staff for inclusion in the inmate central file and a copy to the\ninmate. b. Lodging Requirements (Detainers). For a state or local authority to lodge a detainer\nagainst an inmate in Bureau custody, including Bureau-contracted private-sector secure\ncorrections facilities, the requesting authority must provide a copy of the warrant/abstract along\nwith a cover letter requesting placement of a detainer in its favor. SENTRY will be used to lodge the detainer and a DAL will be used to acknowledge the lodging\nof the detainer. Ordinarily, the warrant/abstract will be certified, however, if the requesting authority does not\ncertify the document, CSD staff must verify its authenticity with the requesting authority via\ntelephone and document the verification on the warrant/abstract. If the warrant/abstract is received without a letter requesting placement as a detainer, staff must\nreturn the document(s) to the issuing agency with instructions to forward a certified copy of the\nwarrant/abstract along with a cover letter. CSD staff will use the DAL for this purpose. Federal authorities are not required to provide certified copies of the warrant/abstract to lodge a\ndetainer in their favor. The nature of the Federal detainer, however, must be clear on the\ndocumentation presented to the institution. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 6, Page 2"

(These same procedures apply for D.C.\nCode offenders.) If at any time thereafter the inmate informs the custodian that they demand a trial, such person\nwill promptly notify the U.S. Attorney or AUSA who filed the detainer. Forms used for\nnotifying inmates of the filing of the Federal detainer based on untried charges are usually sent\nwith the USMS detainer request. If not, notify the requesting USMS. c. Lodging Procedures for Notifications. When a formal request is received from a Federal,\nstate, or local jurisdiction requesting notification of an inmate’s release, a DAL will be used to\nacknowledge the lodging of the notify. d. SENTRY Update. When a detainer or request for notification is received, CSD staff will\nupdate the inmate’s current detainer/notify status (Sentence Monitoring, Update Detainer/Update\nNotify screen) in SENTRY. CSD staff will update, in a timely manner, the inmate’s current detainer/notify status each time a\ndetainer or notification is filed, removed, or changed. e. Removal of Detainers or Notifications. CSD staff must verify any correspondence\nrequesting a detainer or notification removal. The name of the person contacted, title, telephone\nnumber, date, and signature of CSD staff verifying this information must be clearly marked on\nthe correspondence requesting the removal of the detainer or notification. A DAL will be sent to\nthe agency notifying them that their detainer or notification has been removed per their request. 604. U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE (USMS) AND IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS\nENFORCEMENT (ICE) DETAINERS Warrants are not required when the USMS or ICE files a Federal detainer. Ordinarily, the USMS\nwill use their detainer request (Forms M-16A-D or M-17) and ICE will use their Immigration\nDetainer form. CSD staff are encouraged to establish procedures with the local ICE office in order to streamline\nreceipt and verification of an immigration detainer. A DAL may be used for this purpose,\nhowever, if local procedures are established, appropriate distribution of the lodged detainer must\nbe followed within the institution. 605.

If the requesting authority indicates in writing it will not take custody of the inmate, a DAL will\nbe completed and forwarded, the detainer will be removed, the warrant will be returned, and\nthe institution may continue with release planning. The unit team will be notified of the removal of all detainers via DAL. If the detainer is removed\nwithin one month of release, the unit team will be notified of the action without delay (ordinarily\nwithin the same business day). If the filing authority has indicated it will take custody, but on the day of scheduled release\nchooses not to, it is requested that the filing authority provide written documentation of its intent. (A faxed copy is adequate, however, CS staff must verify the document and file it in the J&C\nfile.) If the filing authority cannot provide written documentation, telephonic verification will be\naccepted and documented accordingly. In either case, the inmate will be released to the\ncommunity provided no other detainer has been lodged against the inmate. If multiple detainers have been filed, with the exception of federal detainers, custody will be\noffered first to the earliest lodged detainer. All jurisdictions that have lodged detainers are to be\nnotified of the detaining authority taking custody at release to allow those jurisdictions to re-file\ntheir detainer(s) with the agency taking custody of the inmate. Federal detainers will take priority over non-Federal detainers. Immigration Detainers The following language refers to ALL ICE detainers. If an inmate has a federal detainer and an immigration detainers on file, custody will be\ngiven to the federal law enforcement agency first. If an inmate has an immigration\nP5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 6, Page 4 detainer and a non-federal detainer on file, ICE will be offered custody first. CS staff will notify ICE of all inmates who have an immigration detainer at least ninety\n(90) days prior to the inmate’s projected release date, or as soon as staff becomes aware of\nthe detainer. CS staff will send a DAL, release notifications, copies of all federal and nonfederal detainers, and pertinent information to the ICE Pacific Response Center (PERC),\nvia email, at the following email address: bopreleases@ice.dhs.gov. At the time of notification, ICE will be provided with the inmate's medical and mental\nhealth care level."

At the time of notification, ICE will be provided with the inmate's medical and mental\nhealth care level. For inmates identified as Medical Health Care Level 3 or 4, and/or\nMental Health Care Level 3 or 4, a Health Services Exit Summary and/or a Psychology\nServices Mental Health Transfer Summary will be provided in an encrypted electronic\ncopy to the above-mentioned email address. These summaries will include, at a minimum,\na list of medications, any required medical and nursing care and/or treatment, medical\nequipment requirements, ability to conduct activities of daily living, and plan of care. The\nCMC or SCSS will ensure this information and these documents are submitted to ICE. Upon request, CS staff will provide ICE's medical staff at the ICE Enforcement and\nRemoval Operations (ERO) field office with an encrypted electronic copy of the inmate’s\nmedical record, including the most recent lab work and diagnostic tests (e.g., x-rays, MRI,\nCT scan) for any current health problems. The encrypted electronic copy should be sent to\nthe ICE ERO field office requesting the information. ICE will notify CS staff 60 days prior to the PRD, or as soon as possible, of its decision to\nassume or decline custody of the inmate. If ICE declines custody, CS staff may transfer\ncustody of the inmate to the law enforcement agency who lodged a detainer, or release the\ninmate if no other detainer is on file. If ICE declines to accept custody, the responsible ICE\nERO field office must cancel the detainer by checking the appropriate box on the\napplicable detainer and notify CS staff. Once CS staff receives this notification, a DAL\nmust be completed and sent to ICE in order to remove the immigration detainer. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 6, Page 5 607. PAROLE TO A DETAINER When an inmate is granted parole to a detainer, all appropriate staff must refer to the conditions\ncited on the NOA to ensure compliance. When situations arise that are unclear, CSD staff must\ncontact the USPC for further direction. 608. EXTRADITION An inmate’s extradition from one state to another will be the sole responsibility of the state in\nwhich the inmate is being housed. The exception exists when an inmate files for disposition of\ncharges under the provisions of Article III of the IADA. Under Article III, the inmate waives extradition rights only for those charges for which he is\nbeing removed and may be turned over directly to the agency that placed the detainer. Note: Extradition hearings are not required in some states. Refer to Chapter 9 of this manual\nfor the list of states not requiring extradition hearings. CSD staff must contact the Attorney General’s office in both the state the inmate is housed and\nthe state that lodged the detainer, after consultation with the assigned legal representative, if the\ninmate is due for release and meets the following criteria:\n■ A detainer is on file for an outstanding charge or conviction.\n■"

It must be made clear to the Attorney General’s office that the Bureau is obligated by statute to\nrelease the inmate at the expiration of the sentence and cannot violate any state extradition law\nby releasing the inmate directly to the state requesting custody. 609. INMATE NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSE The IADA applies to Federal and state inmates who have entered upon a term of imprisonment in\nan institution designated for service of the sentence. Resolution of any untried charges may be\nobtained through provisions of the Act. The portions of the Act related to inmates confined in\nFederal institutions are incorporated as follows:\na. Availability. The IADA is not available for the inmate or the prosecutor until the inmate\narrives at the designated institution for service of the sentence. Before reaching the designated\ninstitution, the requesting agency may obtain custody via a writ of habeas corpus ad P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 6, Page 6 prosequendum. (Refer to the Program Statement on Transfer of Inmates to State Agents for\nProduction on State Writs for more information.)\nb. Notification. Article III(c) requires the Bureau to inform the inmate of the source and\ncontent of any detainer lodged. CSD staff will notify the inmate by completing the IAD – Notice\nof Untried Indictment form (BP-A235). The inmate will sign the form acknowledging the\ndetainer has been lodged and that he/she was advised of inmate’s rights under the IADA. This\nform will then be forwarded to the Warden, or designee, for signature. Upon return of the signed\nform, the original will be forwarded to the inmate. c. Inmate Appearance in Court. An inmate may appear in state court to dispose of pending\ncharges under Article III of the IADA. If a situation occurs that precludes an inmate’s release\nunder this provision (i.e., medical condition, other pending court actions, security concerns, etc.)\nthe assigned legal representative and the requesting agency will be consulted to discuss and\nresolve any conflicts. 610. INMATE REQUEST FOR FINAL DISPOSITION\nArticle III (d) provides that once an inmate has been notified of any detainer, and the inmate has\narrived at the designated institution, the inmate may request final disposition of the charges for\nwhich the detainer is based. By doing so, the inmate waives the right to contest extradition for\nany charges that form the basis of the request, either during or after completion of the Federal\nsentence. Extradition procedures will apply separately to charges unrelated to the IADA charges. a. Waiver of Extradition. A Waiver of Extradition means that the receiving state may take\ncustody of the inmate directly from the institution for those charges that the IADA is based upon. This is regardless of whether the state in which the institution is located requires that the inmate\nbe released to its jurisdiction to satisfy the extradition rules for its state. b. Appointment of Counsel. The inmate initiates final disposition of pending charges by\ncompleting the IAD – Place of Imprisonment form (BP-A236)."

It is important that the inmate\nshow on the BP-A236 his or her designated counsel or request the court to appoint counsel for\nrepresentation. If the inmate needs assistance to complete the form, institution staff must assist. c. Disposition of Charges. Once an inmate requests disposition of charges, CSD staff will\nprepare the IAD – Certificate of Inmate Status form (BP-A238) and the IAD – Offer to Deliver\nTemporary Custody form (BP-A239). Note: In the body of the BP-A239, first and second paragraph, there are two types of requests\nlisted, inmate request and prosecutor request. CSD staff must ensure that clarification is made as\nto the appropriate request. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 6, Page 7 d. Required Paperwork – Distribution. CSD staff will prepare a Prosecutor’s Notification\nletter (see sample – Attachment B) and mail it along with the inmate’s request for final\ndisposition of charges to the prosecuting official. This letter addresses the prosecutor’s\nrequirement to send the Bureau the following completed forms:\n■ IAD Form VI – Evidence of Agents’ Authority (BP-A564). ■ IAD Form VII – Prosecutor's Acceptance of Temporary Custody (BP-A566). ■ IAD/State Writ – Prosecutor’s Certification (BP-A565). (A blank copy must be included in\nthe IADA packet sent to the prosecutor.) The Prosecutor’s Notification letter must also address any security requirements the Bureau\ndeems necessary. Note: The above forms (BP-A564, BP-A565, BP-A566) are Bureau forms. If the requesting\nprosecuting official does not have the equivalent of these forms, the Bureau will supply them. e. Notification to the Receiving State. CSD staff must notify the following of the inmate’s\nrequest:\n■ Clerk of the Court, via Certified Mail, Return Receipt. ■ Prosecuting Officer, via Certified Mail, Return Receipt. ■ IADA Compact Administrator, via First-Class Mail. Copies of the forms, including the BP-A235, along with the cover letter, are to be forwarded as\nfollows:\n■ Clerk of the Court: a copy of the cover letter and copies of the forms. ■ Prosecuting Officer: the original cover letter and copies of the forms. ■ IADA Compact Administrator: a copy of the cover letter and the original forms. In addition, a copy of the letter and all forms are to be placed in the J&C file, inmate central file,\nand a copy will be forwarded to the inmate. f. Additional IADA Notifications. CSD staff will also mail, via First-Class Mail, a copy of\nthe IADA packet to any other prosecutor and Clerk of the Court who has lodged a detainer from\nthe state in which the inmate's request for final disposition is being sent. The prosecuting officials must be notified by an accompanying letter (see sample, Attachment C)\nthat all such indictments, informations, or complaints, as listed on form BP-A239, must be\ndisposed of according to the provisions of Article III of the Agreement.

CSD staff must set up a retrieval system for tracking the twoweek follow-up date. In the event the return receipt is not received, CSD staff may visit the U.S.\nPostal Service public website to obtain delivery date confirmation. h. Notification Follow-Up. CSD staff will determine, two weeks after mailing, whether the\nIAD packet has arrived at the proper destinations and the institution has received the return\nreceipts. If CSD staff have not received a reply to the inmate’s request for disposition within 90 days, or to\nany letters of notification sent to other jurisdictions in the state, CSD staff will send a letter to the\nprosecutor and the IADA Compact Administrator in the receiving state to learn the state’s intent\nfor assuming temporary custody (see sample, Attachment D).\ni. 180-Day Period. If the inmate has not been brought to trial within 180 days from the date\nprosecuting officials received the IAD packet, CSD staff will correspond with the prosecutor (see\nsample, Attachment E) calling attention to the lapse of the 180-day period. Only the state may authorize the removal of its detainer. The inmate must address any request regarding a possible violation of the IADA to the\nappropriate state court. 611. PROSECUTOR REQUEST FOR TEMPORARY CUSTODY Article IV gives the prosecutor an opportunity to request temporary custody of an individual. The\npurpose is to resolve the untried charges which form the basis of the associated detainer. Ordinarily, a prosecutor’s request is received as an IAD Form V, Request for Temporary Custody\n(BP-A568). Sometimes, a state writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum is issued. When this occurs, and a\ndetainer has been lodged, the state writ will be treated the same as the IAD Form V.\nNote: If a detainer is on file for one jurisdiction and another jurisdiction within the same “party\nstate” files a state writ, the state writ will be treated as an Article IV IAD request and the inmate\nmust go out “IAD” on all. a. 30-Day Period. Under the provisions of Article IV(a) the Warden has up to 30 days to\napprove or disapprove the state's request for temporary custody. During this time, the inmate\nmay petition the Warden to disapprove the state’s request for temporary custody. The inmate\nwill sign a waiver, either requesting or waiving the 30-day period (See sample, Attachment F). The Warden is not obligated to grant the inmate's request and may use some or all of the 30-day\nP5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 6, Page 9 period to decide whether to grant the state's request for temporary custody. The 30-day period\nbegins on the date the prosecutor's request is received at the institution."

If this occurs, follow procedures\noutlined in section 510, Inmate Request for Final Disposition. b. Required Paperwork – Distribution. After receiving the IAD request from the\nprosecutor, CSD staff will prepare the following:\n■ IAD – Certificate of Inmate Status (BP-A238). ■ IAD – Offer to Deliver Temporary Custody (BP-A239). ■ IAD/State Writ – Prosecutor’s Certification (BP-A565). (A blank copy must be included in\nthe IADA packet sent to the prosecutor.)

Copies are also to be mailed to the IADA Compact Administrator. All forms will be sent via\nFirst Class Mail. Copies will also be placed in the J&C file, inmate central file, and a complete copy will be\nforwarded to the inmate. 612.

CHALLENGES TO AN INMATE’S IADA RIGHTS If an inmate says that his or her rights have been violated under the IAD, the inmate will be\nadvised to contact the state authorities or his or her attorney. The Bureau does not decide the validity of the detainer or violation of any IAD provision. All detainers will remain in full force and effect, unless and until the charges from the “receiving\nstate” are dismissed and/or the receiving state authorizes, in writing, the removal of the detainer. a. Return of Inmate Before Completion of Proceedings. If the inmate is returned to the\nBureau before completion of all state court proceedings, the detainer will remain on file. The\nBureau will honor the “receiving state’s” request for temporary custody if they should request to\nassume custody again under the IAD. The original IAD paperwork suffices to return the inmate to the “receiving state” if the agents\nassuming custody are the same. Requirements applicable to the initial temporary transfer of custody will still apply. b. Re-filing of Charges. If an inmate files for disposition of charges and the state drops the\ndetainer that forms the basis for the inmate’s request, the detainer will be returned to the\noriginating agency, making the inmate’s IAD request moot. Once the detainer is removed, all documentation, except the letter requesting removal of the\ndetainer and the IAD – Place of Imprisonment form (BP-A236), will be disposed of. If the same agency wishes to re-file the same charges later, it may do so, and the detainer request\nwill be honored and the inmate may again request disposition of the charges under the IAD. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 6, Page 11 c. State Writ Request – No Detainer on File. If the state wishes to issue a writ to request\ntemporary custody and does not file a detainer, the inmate may be released via state writ.

For\nmore information on state writs, refer to the Program Statement, Transfer of Inmates to State\nAgents for Production on State Writs. 613. BEFORE TEMPORARY RELEASE TO IAD\nCSD staff will present and explain the IAD/State Writ – Acknowledgment (BP-A567) to the\ninmate prior to release under either Article III or Article IV of the IAD. If the inmate is improperly released to the community by local authorities or improperly\ntransferred to any non-Federal facility or agency while under the IAD process, this form requires\nthe inmate to call the person designated on the BP-A567 (collect or through any other\ncommunication systems available) immediately, upon the release or transfer. CSD staff must have the inmate sign the BP-A567 before release to state agents under the IAD. If\nthe inmate refuses to sign the Acknowledgment, staff must advise the inmate of the form's\ncontents and document the refusal to sign. The Warden designates the contact person to be listed on the BP-A567. A copy of the form is given to the inmate prior to being released under the IAD."

FEDERAL INMATES HOUSED IN NON-FEDERAL FACILITIES Federal inmates housed in non-Federal facilities, i.e., state concurrency cases and long term\nboarders, may request disposition of “untried” indictments, informations, or complaints pursuant\nto Article III of the IAD, provided those charges are lodged as detainers with the authorities who\nare housing the inmate. Staff at the non-Federal facility are responsible for processing the IAD\npaperwork. All policies governing the state in which the inmate is housed will be followed regarding the\nFederal inmate. Similarly, the prosecuting officer can request a Federal boarder’s temporary\ncustody under Article IV of the IADA provided a detainer is on file and the charges which form\nthe basis for the detainer are otherwise processed under the Agreement. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 6, Page 12 When Bureau staff receive a detainer, the original detainer and any other correspondence\nconcerning the detainer will be forwarded to the state facility housing the inmate. When\napplicable, the CCM is to maintain a copy of the detainer paperwork in the J&C file. When the IADA’s provisions arise for Federal inmates boarded in the states of Mississippi,\nLouisiana, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or other non-members of the IAD, the CCM will\ncontact the appropriate Regional Counsel for further instruction. 615. STATE BOARDERS HOUSED IN BUREAU CUSTODY All requests for disposition of charges by the inmate, or a prosecutor’s request for temporary\ncustody of an inmate placed as a State Boarder in a Federal facility, will be processed in the same\nmanner as if the State Boarder was a Federal inmate. 616. FOREIGN DETAINERS If information indicates an inmate may be wanted in a foreign country (i.e., foreign criminal\ncharges, escape from a foreign prison, etc.), CSD staff will make a written request to the\nCorrectional Programs Branch, Central Office, to investigate possible pending foreign charges. The request must include the source document that is the basis of the inquiry. Once received, Correctional Programs staff will review and forward the request to the Office of\nInternational Affairs. Follow-up procedures and time frames will be the same as for domestic\nDALs. If the inmate is wanted in a foreign country, the foreign country files a request for extradition\nwith the Office of International Affairs who then contacts the International Coordinator at the\nappropriate U.S. Attorney’s Office who assigns an AUSA to handle extradition proceedings\nthrough the Federal court."

FEDERAL WRITS AND REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION\nFederal Writs of Habeas Corpus and Requests for Production (often referred to as Attorney\nSpecial Requests or ASRs) are issued by the court and U.S. Attorneys. The purpose is to acquire\nconfined individuals for hearings on issues concerning the legality or conditions of confinement,\nmodification of a sentence, new prosecution, or as a witness to give testimony. Civil and criminal Writs of Habeas Corpus from the D.C. Superior Court will be considered and\nprocessed as Federal Writs. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 6, Page 13 CSD staff must contact the issuing court or U.S. Attorney to verify the authenticity of the writ or\nproduction request. The verification will be noted on the document itself. Note: Refer to Chapter 4 for verification requirements. Some local courts may not verify the\nauthenticity of writs. In these cases, contact the Regional Correctional Programs Administrator\nfor further guidance. If the institution has not previously received a copy of the writ or production request, the agent\ndirected to assume custody must present it upon arrival to the institution. Ordinarily the agent\nwill be a Deputy U.S. Marshal from the district in which the inmate is located. If the writ/Request for Production calls for appearance in another district, transportation is\narranged by Prisoner Coordination of the USMS. 618. STATE WRITS The Warden may authorize an inmate to be released on writ for production in state court. All authorized releases via state writ will require CSD staff to verify the authenticity using the\nsame procedures as for a Federal writ. (Refer to the Program Statement on Transfer of Inmates\nto State Agents for Production on State Writs for more information.) 619. FOLLOW-UP OF TRANSFER To ensure that inmates released under the provisions of the IAD, state, or Federal writ remain in\ncustody and are returned to the sending institution upon completion of court proceedings, CSD\nstaff will contact the authorities who have custody of the inmate at 60 calendar day intervals to\nlearn the inmate’s status.

To provide this notification, staff must prepare a Notice of Escaped Federal Prisoner (BP-A393). This notice will be distributed to all concerned agencies, to include the DSCC, with a copy filed\nin the J&C file and in the inmate central file. The SENTRY Sentence Monitoring Update Jail Credit/Inop Time transaction will be updated by\nthe DSCC to show the inmate’s sentence is in inoperative status as a result of the escape. The inmate’s sentence will be made inoperative in SENTRY as of the day following the escape\n(any portion of a day in custody counts as a full day for credit purposes). If an inmate escapes while temporarily released from custody (furlough, writ, etc.), it is the\nreleasing institution’s responsibility to update the SENTRY ARS code to reflect ESCAPE. When an inmate escapes from a halfway house, follow procedures in the Community Corrections\nManual and notify the DSCC. After completion of the required paperwork, the inmate central file and medical file will be\nforwarded to the Records Office, where it will be maintained until the inmate is apprehended and\nre-designated. 702.

The inmate will be placed on escape status as per the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 4082(a) or 18\nU.S.C. § 4082(d) (repealed). P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 7, Page 1 Once the escape has been verified, institution staff or Community Corrections Management\n(CCM) staff will change the ARS code to ESCAPE.

When an inmate escapes while on furlough/transfer to a RRC, the sending institution will notify\nthe FBI in their district. When an inmate escapes while housed in a RRC, the responsible CCM\nstaff will notify the FBI in their district. The sending institution (or CCM Office for direct court commitments) will consolidate and retain\nthe J&C file, inmate central file, and Health Record. Once the inmate has been returned to\nBureau custody, the consolidated file will be requested and forwarded to the designated\ninstitution. If a Victim Witness Protection case escapes, notification procedures are to be followed as\noutlined in the Program Statement on Victim and Witness Notification. a. Non-Federal Arrest. If an inmate fails to report to the designated institution or facility, the\nsending institution in the case of institution transfers, or the CCM office in the case of arrest\nwhile assigned to a RRC, will change the ARS code in SENTRY to ESCAPE. If an arrest occurs\nwhile on an authorized community based activity, the CCM/institution staff will change the ARS\ncode in SENTRY to ESCAPE. In the following situations, the Chief, DSCC will determine whether to apply the credit or\ndesignate the non-Federal institution where the inmate is confined as the place to serve the\nFederal sentence. (Refer to the Program Statement on Designation of State Institution for\nService of Federal Sentence for more information.):\n■ Prosecuted and found guilty of an offense by a state or local court. ■ Tried and acquitted, or the charges are dismissed and the inmate is returned to Federal\ncustody. ■ Arrested and detained mistakenly for any time longer than one full day. ■ Arrested and detained on a prior non-Federal judgement. Once the non-Federal institution is designated as the place in which the Federal sentence is to be\nserved, the Federal institution or CCM office will transfer custody by preparing a Transfer Order\nfor concurrent and continued service of the Federal sentence. The transferring institution or CCM office will forward the Transfer Order and all files (central,\nmedical and J&C) to the appropriate regional correctional programs administrator. The regional correctional programs specialist will ensure a letter is forwarded to the USMS\nrequesting that they (USMS) place a detainer on the inmate with the non-Federal institution. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 7, Page 2 b. Federal Arrest. If Federal authorities arrest an inmate during an authorized extended\nabsence, the inmate’s sentence will continue to run and the ARS code will not be changed to\nESCAPE. Should the inmate be arrested after an authorized absence expires, but prior to one full day of\ninoperative time, the inmate's sentence continues to run. If an inmate has already been placed in\nescape status for more than one day (for other than a new arrest), and is subsequently arrested for\nan offense other than escape, the sentence will recommence on the Federal arrest date."

When required, one completed card, for inmates with felony and misdemeanor charges,\nwill be submitted to the FBI within five working days of commitment. Two full sets of fingerprints will be taken on the initial commitment of designated (A-DES)\ninmates. This includes state boarders, D.C. Code offenders, military and territorial prisoners,\nviolators, and escapees upon their return to custody. (The notation “Return from Escape” must be\nincluded in the “Charge” block on escapees upon their return to custody.) Both cards are to be completed in their entirety with one card submitted to the FBI. The\nSENTRY Inmate Label transaction may not be used on the card sent to the FBI. One full set of fingerprints will be taken on the initial commitment of a Bureau of Immigration &\nCustoms Enforcement inmate (A-INS), Material Witness (A-MAT), Holdover (A-HLD),\nPre-trial inmate (A-PRE), and an un-sentenced study case inmate.

In these cases, the FBI number will be available as well as leads\nthat may be useful in determining current status of pending charges or detainers. Arrest records received directly from the FBI will be reviewed by CSD staff for the following\ninformation:\n To confirm identity of commitments. (Questionable cases will be referred to the Regional\nCorrectional Programs Administrator.) P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 8, Page 4  To obtain and record FBI numbers in SENTRY which were previously unavailable.\n To determine whether charges may be pending in any other jurisdiction that need to be\ninvestigated.

DEFINITION AND RESPONSIBILITIES The Institution Correctional Systems Department/DSCC is responsible for preparing inmates for\nrelease from the institution as a result of:\n\n\n\n\n\n Medical treatment. Transfer to another Federal facility. Court orders. USPC decisions. Expiration of the confinement portion of the sentence. Any other method meeting legal qualifications for release. To carry out this responsibility, the following procedures are established for processing inmates\nfor release. 902. TEMPORARY RELEASE OF INMATES\na. Emergency Medical Release. An emergency medical release requires an inmate’s\nimmediate removal to a medical facility, other than the institution hospital, for emergency\ntreatment. This type of release usually occurs when an inmate is injured in an accident, is\nassaulted, attempts suicide, or experiences some other medical emergency of a life threatening\nnature. Note: Proper photograph and fingerprint identification will be made prior to the inmate’s\ndeparture from the institution, when possible. In life threatening situations, identification will be\ndelayed until local hospital officials give approval to complete the process. Fingerprint identification will be obtained (placed on a Marshals’ Receipt, BP-A378, or a\nTransfer Receipt, BP-A821) for inmates who are at the hospital and will be guarded by a contract\nsecurity guard service at the outside facility."

Inmates whom Bureau staff guard will not require fingerprint identification but will require a\nphotograph comparison. All paperwork will be completed pursuant to the Escorted Trips\nProgram Statement. Procedures for inmates housed in a RRC are covered in the Community Corrections Manual. b. Scheduled Inmate Movement. When notice has been received of a scheduled movement,\ndesignated staff will use the Transfer Receipt listing all inmates being transferred. The Transfer P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 9, Page 1 Receipt will advise all concerned departments of the deadline date for preparing required\npaperwork and the forwarding of files to the designated staff. The Transfer Receipt will be issued no later than the morning of the last working day prior to the\nday of departure. This receipt will not be made available to inmates or unauthorized staff not involved in the\ntransfer process. CSD staff will review the files to ensure all necessary paperwork is completed. This review will\ninclude the following:\n Ensure the DSCC/Central Office has approved the transfer by reviewing the PP10 within 24\nhours of the movement of each CIM case.\n If the transfer would result in a delay in the inmate’s scheduled parole hearing, defer the\ntransfer until after the hearing.  The inmate may not be transferred until all pending writs are satisfied or have been addressed\nwith the prosecuting attorney.  The inmate may not be transferred if the court has issued a Restraining Order. The transfer\nwill be delayed until the court withdraws the order or the time limit of the order has been\nsatisfied.  For each inmate scheduled to be transferred, ensure the inmate central file, J&C file, medical\nrecord, the inmate’s ID card (if available), education file (if hard copy exists), Parole\nCommission File (if the transfer occurs prior to the initial hearing), one copy of the Transfer\nOrder, Medical Summary of Federal Prisoner/Alien in Transit (BP-A656), and the SENTRYgenerated In-Transit Data Form (BP-A0175) with photograph are assembled to be transferred\nsimultaneously with the inmate, or at the latest, within 72 hours.  Changes in statutes/rules language. CSD staff will place all of the inmate’s records in an envelope/container; each envelope/\ncontainer is marked with the inmate’s full name, register number, the institution which is the\nfinal destination, and the inmate’s transfer date. If more than one envelope/container is required, each will be marked and attached to each other\nin such a manner that they will not become separated.

Bus/Van/Airlift and Special Trips. All inmates transported via bus, van, or special move\nwill be coordinated with Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS), Kansas\nCity, Missouri. Lists of the inmates scheduled to be moved, their destinations, and the itinerary\nof the bus trip are issued by JPATS the week preceding the trip, if possible. A Transfer Receipt\nwill be prepared in accordance with the Receiving and Discharge Manual. Institutions may add or delete an inmate to a trip list only if the placement will not result in the\ndeletion of another inmate scheduled for the trip, if there is a seat available, and if it has been\napproved by JPATS. Immediately after the bus has departed the institution, a GroupWise message with the attached\nfinal transfer receipt will be forwarded to JPATS. Note: It is imperative that the correct vehicle code is used when releasing an inmate. All\nreceipts will reflect the vehicle code associated with that specific movement. All procedures relating to the movement of inmates via bus also apply to airlift movements. (Refer to the Program Statement on Escorted Trips for more information.) All inmates must have the appropriate medical clearance prior to transfer. (Refer to the Program\nStatement on Medical Designations & Referral Services for Federal Prisoners for more\ninformation.) Inmates who present medical or security concerns may require special movement by Bureau\npersonnel. The institution Warden will direct these movements. JPATS must be notified. d. Unescorted Movement. Some inmates may travel unescorted to report voluntarily to a\ndesignated institution or via furlough transfer to another institution or contract RRC. (Refer to\nthe Program Statements on Furloughs and Unescorted Transfers and Voluntary Surrenders for\nadditional information). Unescorted Transfer to a Federal Institution, Non-Federal Contract Facility, RRC, or\nCommunity-Based Program. When an inmate is released via furlough transfer, the furlough\npacket will be routed through CSD for a final detainer and legal status review (e.g., pending\nwrits, warrants, and/or charges) prior to delivery to the Warden for signature.

They are to be filed separately from the J&C files of inmates at the institution. The completed release documents and terminal report will be mailed to the parent institution\nCSD. The CCMs will dispose of duplicate documentation before forwarding files to the parent\ninstitution. Duplicate documentation is considered to be anything that is already in the institution\nfile, such as the PSI and J&C’s. Properly signed, updated BP-A338’s and incident reports must\nbe forwarded for inclusion in the central file. When the material is received from the CCM, CSD staff will forward the completed release\nmaterials to unit staff for inclusion in the inmate’s central file."

SCHEDULING INMATES FOR FINAL RELEASE The Institution Correctional Systems Department/DSCC will establish and maintain local\nprocedures, including the use of SENTRY, to ensure the timely release of inmates. The DSCC\nwill audit the sentence computations of all inmates to be released, including any good time\nactions, before certifying each release date. Staff in other departments will access SENTRY to obtain current release dates for release\nplanning and preparation. Note: CSD staff are not required to prepare and forward a release list. The Community Corrections Manual contains instructions for inmates releasing from community\ncorrections facilities. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 9, Page 4 a. Public Law, Weekend, and Holiday Releases. In accordance with 18 U.S.C. §§ 4163 and\n3624(a), whenever possible, inmates may be released on the last preceding weekday if their\nprojected release date falls on a weekend or holiday. An inmate will not, however, be released on parole or mandatory parole on the last preceding\nweekday if the actual release date falls before the parole eligibility date. Refer to the Program Statement on Release of Inmates Prior to a Weekend or Legal Holiday for\nmore information. Note: Inmates in any facility as a condition of supervision are not serving a sentence of\nimprisonment, and therefore, are not eligible for Public Law days. b. Secret Service Notification. The Secret Service requires release notification of those\ninmates who are considered dangerous to the President or Vice President of the United States and\nother government officials. They will provide a Secret Service Notification Card which is placed\nin the Inmate Remand or J&C file with a copy to unit staff for inclusion in the inmate central file. This will not be loaded into SENTRY as a “notify.”\nc. Release of State/Territory/Commonwealth Inmates.

The response received from the appropriate\nauthorities will be noted/filed in the J&C file and will serve as the authority to release the inmate\nfrom custody. d. Inmates Releasing to a State Detainer. When an inmate has a detainer based on untried\ncharges (e.g., indictments, informations, complaints), the inmate will be turned over to local\nauthorities or any other detaining authority that has filed a detainer within that state. When an inmate has a detainer for service of a sentence (or for a parole or probation revocation\nhearing), the following applies:\n Institutions in the following states will turn the inmate over directly to the out-of-state\nauthorities (that is, authorities from the state lodging the detainer). There is no need to turn\nthe inmate over to local authorities for extradition proceedings. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 9, Page 5 Arizona\nCalifornia\nFlorida\nKansas\nLouisiana Michigan\nNew Jersey\nNew York\nNevada\nNorth Carolina South Carolina\nVirginia\nWisconsin  Institutions in any state not listed above must turn the inmate over to local authorities to\nwaive or contest extradition proceedings; except when the state sentence is a result of the\ninmate’s own earlier IAD (Article III) request for disposition of his/her case. In these situations, the inmate’s extradition rights have been waived and the inmate may be\nturned directly over to the out-of-state authorities. It is the CSD staff’s responsibility to notify detaining authorities of the pending release and to\nadvise them of the procedures to follow to obtain custody. Refer to Chapter 6 for more information on pre-release notification. e. Release of Military Inmates. Inmates released from their sentence through the operation of\n“good time” (Mandatory Release, Expiration with Good Time, or Parole) with an offense date of\nAugust 15, 2001, or earlier, are not subject to supervision. A 180-day date is therefore\ninapplicable and must not be entered on the computation. Inmates released from their sentence through the operation of “good time” (Mandatory Release,\nExpiration with Good Time, or Parole) with an offense date after August 15, 2001, are subject to\nsupervision until the expiration of the sentence imposed. Such supervision is at the USPC’s discretion. They will determine if such supervision is\nnecessary for the inmate’s orderly transition back into the community. The U.S. Probation Office in the district of release will supervise any inmate released by action\nof the USPC. Military and Coast Guard inmates released on parole are subject to the same USPC\nrules and regulations as Federal inmates. f. Transfer of an Inmate to a Foreign Country."

However, a Release\nAuthorization need not be prepared when a transfer receipt is used (e.g., bus/airlift). Instructions\nfor completing these forms are outlined below. Note: An In-Transit Data Form need not be completed for the final release of an inmate to the\ncommunity. Chapter 10 of this manual outlines the types of final release and the paperwork associated with\neach type of release. For final releases, unit staff will prepare the release paperwork and a release folder on each\ninmate scheduled for release. This folder will contain the inmate’s various release paperwork\nand an envelope with the inmate’s name and register number. All documents, forms, or items that are to be given to the inmate at release will be placed in this\nenvelope, including the inmate’s driver’s license or Social Security card, which may have been\nstored in section 3 of the inmate central file. The inmate may retain his or her inmate\nidentification card upon release. The completed release folder will be delivered to CSD staff no later than two working days prior\nto the inmate’s scheduled release date, however, unit staff are encouraged to complete and route\nthe release packet in advance of the release date to allow time for corrections. CSD staff will verify each release folder for content and accuracy of CSD-related data, e.g., days\nremaining, release method, release date, etc. Unit staff are responsible for making corrections,\nproviding mailing envelopes with addresses, and returning the packet to CSD. a. In-Transit Data Form (BP-A0175). Upon notice that an inmate is to be transferred,\ntemporarily released, or permanently released to an authorized Law Enforcement Officer (i.e.,\nUSMS, State Law Enforcement Officer, Bureau of Prisons Bus Officer), the CSD will ensure the\nfollowing:\n A hard copy of the SENTRY automated In-Transit Data Form is provided.\n The information indicated on the top portion of the form is accurate and is verified with\nsource documents (refer to Chapter 4 for more information).\n The detainer remarks printed are accurate and up-to-date (refer to Chapter 6 for more\ninformation).  The “CMC Clearance and Separatee Data” was reviewed within the last 24 hours, and if\nchanged, a new copy will be attached.

SENTRY update functions will need to be executed if the data is not accurate. Once SENTRY\nhas been updated, unit staff will be notified and a new form will be completed. b. Release Authorization Form (BP-A392). The BP-A392 will be used to release inmates\nfor completion of sentences, appeal bonds, court-ordered releases, writs of habeas corpus (except\nfor inmates moving on a writ via bus or airlift), commutation of sentences, Interstate Agreement\non Detainers, furlough transfers, transfers to state facilities, and transfers to contract RRC’s. Note: A release authorization need not be prepared for inmates who are removed temporarily by\nand remain in continuous Bureau staff custody. The exchange of custody will be executed\nthrough the use of a Marshals Receipt or Transfer Receipt. The sentence computation will be certified by the DSCC prior to release. The manager or\nsupervisor will normally sign the Release Authorization, unless the Warden’s signature is\nrequired. This signature ensures the following documents have been reviewed:\n\n\n\n\n J&C’s. USPC Warrants. Notices of Action(s). Good Time documents. All detainer information. The following statement is used on the Release Authorization to verify that the proper review, as\nspecified above, has been personally accomplished by the manager/supervisor, prior to the\ninmate’s release:\n“I certify that this release is in accordance with applicable and controlling rules,\nregulations, and statutory provisions. I have personally reviewed this inmate’s Judgment\nand Commitment file, and determined that there is no information that would prevent\nrelease by the method stated above. All Judgment and Commitment Orders, U.S. Parole\nCommission Warrants, Notice of Actions, Good Time documents, and all detainer\ninformation have been personally reviewed by me.” For final releases, the sentence computation will be satisfied and made a prior commitment in\nSENTRY by the DSCC no earlier than five days prior to release. Institution staff will be\nresponsible for making changes to the SENTRY Sentence Monitoring Update Detainer/Notify\nscreens prior to release. P5800.15 1/1/2009 Chapter 9, Page 8 If the confinement portion of a sentence ends and the inmate continues to serve another sentence,\nthe expired sentence will be satisfied and made a prior commitment upon release from all\nsentences. Example: If an inmate is serving multiple sentences due to multiple J&C’s or a multiple count\nJ&C (i.e., SRA and PLRA, or VCCLEA and PLRA, etc.), DSCC staff will be unable to make\nthis expired sentence a prior commitment. This expired sentence (computation) will be satisfied on the date that it ends, however, it will not\nbe made a prior commitment until all sentences on that multiple count J&C are made prior\ncommitments. When an inmate is released to another agency via state writ or IAD, the official assuming\ncustody must sign the Release Authorization. Note:"

Note: To execute an inmate’s release on IAD, a copy of the Evidence of Agents Authority\n(Form VI) will accompany the Release Authorization for comparison of the agents’ signatures. The officer or agent signing the Release Authorization must be listed on the form. The official\ntaking custody will be provided a copy of the Release Authorization which will bear the typed or\nstamped notation:\n“Inmate is to be returned to the (name of institution) and is not to be released from custody\nwithout the written permission of the Warden.” The original Release Authorization, with photograph attached, is to be provided to Receiving and\nDischarge for release purposes, dress-out preparation, and final release certification. The “Release Action” section of the Release Authorization will be completed with the signature\nof the staff member identifying the inmate, the staff member releasing the inmate, and the staff\nmember providing funds to the inmate (unless local procedures are otherwise established). Note: The staff member identifying the inmate upon release must be different from the staff\nmember who releases the inmate. At the time of release, the inmate’s thumbprint will be taken on the original Release\nAuthorization. It will be compared with the thumbprint in the J&C file to verify the inmate’s\nidentity by the releasing staff member.

The DSCC will perform this function. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3624 (New Law), certification of the J&C is not required. 906. UNTIMELY RELEASE NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES Upon receiving a sentence impact document effecting the release of an inmate, the\nmanager/supervisor or Community Corrections Manager will verify the document through\nestablished procedures and forward the document to the DSCC to facilitate re-calculation of the\nrelated sentence. If, upon re-calculation, DSCC staff determine the inmate is an untimely release, notification will\nbe given to the appropriate manager or supervisor, who will then immediately notify the Warden\nor designee. In the event of an early release, DSCC staff will forward the BP-558 (Untimely\nRelease Notification) to the Warden or designee for threat evaluation purposes. Upon re-calculating the affected sentence, DSCC Staff will complete parts A and B of the\nUntimely Release Notification (BP-A558). In cases where the CCM will also route the notification, the CCM will also route the notification\nto the Regional Community Corrections Administrator. If the Untimely Release Notification cannot be forwarded within one day, an e-mail will sent to\nthe Regional Correctional Programs Administrator notifying of the release. The DSCC will ensure the Late Release Notice for United States Probation Service (BP-A623) is\ncompleted and mailed for any late release with supervision to follow."

In any case involving an inmate’s untimely release (including court ordered releases that are not\nacted upon in a timely manner) of 30 days or more and/or has been identified as a threat to the\ncommunity, the Warden must forward a personal letter to the appropriate Judicial Official(s)\nproviding details of the untimely release.

The Chief, DSCC, will review the circumstances of each early/late release and work closely with\nthe Correctional Programs Administrator, Central Office, and institution staff to prevent\nadditional occurrences. In cases which require a threat evaluation (including, but not limited to early release), the DSCC\nshall forward the untimely release notification to the Warden (with a courtesy copy to the\nRegional Correctional Programs Administrator). The Warden will designate a staff member to perform a thorough threat assessment of an early\nrelease. All files must be researched to determine the untimely release’s impact upon the\ncommunity. Special care must be given to determine whether the subject:\n\n\n\n\n Has a history of violence. Has a weapons usage history. Has a record of psychological problems. Is a Broad Publicity case. Requires Victim/Witness notifications. If the untimely release is determined to be a threat to the community, the Warden or designee\nwill make the following notifications telephonically:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Regional Director. Regional Correctional Programs Administrator. District U.S. Marshal or appropriate State/Territory. Department of Corrections. Sentencing Judicial Official(s). Prosecuting Attorney(s).

If the inmate has in\nexcess of 180 days remaining between the date of the actual release date and the established Full\nTerm Date, the inmate is required to be supervised for any days in excess of 180 days. The days remaining to be served are determined by finding the number of days remaining\nbetween the release date and the sentence’s Full Term Date. Exceptions to this rule are NARA\nand JJDPA when days remaining to be served are calculated from the date of release to the Full\nTerm Date without regard to the 180-day date. e. Mandatory Release to Special Parole (M.R. to SPT). In some cases, an inmate in service\nof an SPT Violator Term, who is not otherwise ordered released on parole by the USPC, may be\nreleased at the expiration of his/her term, less good time deductions, back to the SPT remaining. Note: This type of release is called “Mandatory Release to Special Parole.” SPT would begin\nthe day after release.
