As described in the award condition titled “Sole Source Justification”, recipients are required to submit a sole\nsource justification (SSJ) request to the COPS Office for noncompetitive procurements in excess of $150,000 prior\nto purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract; or entering into a contract\nwith award funds. If submitting a sole source justification request to the COPS Office, please use the format\ndescribed in the “Sole Source Justification fact sheet” in the appendices of this manual. If you have any questions regarding the federal requirements that guide procurement procedures, please contact\nyour COPS Office Program Manager.
