If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated Clearinghouse\n(ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on the COPS Office\nwebsite at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf. Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 Your agency must complete the “Payee/Company Information” section following the directions on the back of the\nform and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial institution must\ncomplete the “Financial Institution Information” section and have the appropriate financial official sign the form. If you are already a COPS Office award recipient, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long as\nyour OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment form\ninformation, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Staff Accountant. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you are\nrequired to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFRs) using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able to make\ndrawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the COPS\nOffice by the deadline date. Recipients are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at\nhttps://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see the section of this\nmanual, titled “Reports”. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of “minimum cash on hand” applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. 37 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner’s Manual There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nearlier.
