  "chunk_text": "Thus, while much of the law governing how eligible citizens cast their ballots is governed by the law of\nthe State in which they live, federal law provides critical protections to all voters. Because voting has\nlong been recognized as “preservative of all rights,” Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886), it is\nessential that all eligible citizens’ right to cast a ballot, and have that ballot counted, be protected. If jurisdictions have questions about the constraints federal law places on the methods of voting they are\nusing or propose to use, they should contact the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division. If you would like to report a potential voting rights violation, you can use the Civil Rights Division's online\ncomplaint form to submit a report or call (800) 253-3931. 12 | Guidance Concerning Federal Statutes Affecting Methods of Voting"
