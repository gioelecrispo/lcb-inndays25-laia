After the end of the award period, your agency\nwill be asked to submit a Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) and any applicable final programmatic progress\nreports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final Federal Financial Report FFR (SF-425) for your award is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after\nthe end date of the award period. To avoid being delinquent and having your funds frozen, you must submit an SF425 report within the 30 day grace period, even if your final SF-425 is not due yet. You can revise that report to\nreflect your final actual costs and revise the status as final no later than 90 days after the end date of the award\nperiod. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal expenditures that were incurred\nduring the life of the award, as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. The federal funds\nexpended should reflect only the actual allowable costs incurred relative to the specific TRGP program\nrequirements for that award. In addition, once you have completed your final drawdown, this report should\nreconcile with the total amount of federal funds drawn down by your agency. The final SF-425 should also include\nthe total amount of the local cash match contributed, if applicable When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period.
