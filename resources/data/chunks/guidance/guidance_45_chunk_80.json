The amount of time required to adequately complete the Conference & Events Submission Form will vary\ndepending on the complexity of the proposed event. A small event (in terms of number of attendees,\ntotal cost, etc.) may require only an hour or two to complete the form because the event is basic/routine\nand data are not required in all of the available categories. On the other hand, a large event (in terms of\nnumber of attendees, multiple sessions occurring at the same time, etc.) may require several hours or\ndays depending on the amount of required data (categories) and level of justiﬁcation needed to support\nthe event. Regardless of the size of any event, the supporting justiﬁcation should be suﬃcient to support\nthe agency’s mission for conducting the event. ii. Which types of events do not require prior approval? Currently there are six types of events that do not require prior approval:\na.\nb.\nc. d. e.\nf. Conferences held by grant recipients. (Note: Conferences held by cooperative\nagreement recipients do require prior approval.) Law enforcement operational activities, including staging, surveillance, investigation,\nintelligence, and undercover activities. Routine operational meetings (e.g., staﬀ meetings or all-hands meetings) if held in a\nfederal facility, if held by cooperative agreement recipients in a non-federal facility that\ndoes not charge for its use, and if there are neither costs to the DOJ for logistical\nconference planning nor government-provided food or beverages. In all three of these\ninstances, the answer to all the questions on the Prior Approval Not Required Checklist\nmust be “No.” Site visits are considered routine operational meetings regardless of\nlocation so long as there are no costs to the DOJ for meeting rooms, logistical\nconference planning, or food and beverages. Testing activities where the primary purpose of the event is to evaluate an applicant’s\nqualiﬁcations to perform certain duties necessary to his or her job. This includes\nﬁrearms and weaponry proﬁciency testing and certiﬁcations. A majority of the event\nmust be devoted to administering and taking the test. Testing activities that are\nincidental to a training course or conference or are given upon its completion do require\nprior approval. Video conferences and webinars where there are neither costs to the DOJ for logistical\nconference planning nor government-provided food or beverages. Technical assistance visits where travel was made by an individual or a small group of\nproject staﬀ members to provide training or technical assistance to a particular entity; in\nthis instance, the answer to all the questions on the Prior Approval Not Required\nChecklist must be “No.” 88 2019 COPS Office Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act (LEMHWA) Program Award Owner’s Manual\niii. Where should time staff spent working on the conference that is not related to planning be\ncaptured? Time spent working on a conference by staﬀ or contractors can be classiﬁed as either logistical planning\ntime or programmatic planning time. Programmatic planning includes time spent on activities such as\ndeveloping the conference content and agenda, identifying and recruiting subject matter experts, and\npreparing written materials."
