  "chunk_text": "Provisional rate is a temporary rate applicable to a specified time period that is used for funding, interim\nreimbursement, and reporting of indirect costs pending\nestablishment of a final rate for that period.  De minimis indirect cost rate provides the option for certain nonfederal entities that have never received a\nnegotiated indirect cost rate to accept a flat rate of up to\n10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC). MTDC can\ninclude all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe ben­\nefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the\nfirst $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period of\nperformance of the subawards under the award). MTDC\nexcludes equipment, capital expenditures, rental costs,\ntuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant\nsupport costs, and the portion of each subaward in excess\nof $25,000. Other items may only be excluded when\nnecessary to avoid a serious inequity in the distribution\nof indirect costs and with the approval of the cognizant\nfederal agency for indirect costs. How does an agency establish an indirect\ncost rate? If your agency does not have a previously established indirect\ncost rate, your agency can obtain a rate by contacting your\nagency’s cognizant federal agency, which will review all docu­\nmentation and approve a rate for the covered time period. For more information on the requirements for development\nand submission of indirect (F&A) cost rate proposals, please\nrefer to 2 C.F.R. § 200.414 (e) and Appendices III – VII to\n2 C.F.R. Part 200. 2\nWhat is a cognizant federal agency? Cognizant federal agency for indirect costs as defined in\n2 C.F.R. § 200.19 is the Federal agency responsible for\nreviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation\nplans or indirect cost proposals on behalf of all Federal\nagencies. The cognizant federal agency for indirect cost is\nnot necessarily the same as the cognizant federal agency for\naudit. The COPS Office is not a cognizant federal agency. For nonprofit, state, local, and tribal governments your\ncognizant federal agency is generally the federal agency that\nprovides your organization with the most federal financial\nassistance. For assignments of cognizant federal agencies, see\nthe following:\n1. For institutions of higher education: Appendix III to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assign­\nment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher\nEducation (IHEs), paragraph C.11. 2. For nonprofit organizations: Appendix IV to Part 200— Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and\nRate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations, para­\ngraph C.2.a. 3. For state and local governments: Appendix V to Part 200—State/Local Government and Indian Tribe-Wide\nCentral Service Cost Allocation Plans, paragraph F.1.\n4. For Indian tribes: Appendix VII to Part 200—States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Pro­\nposal, paragraph D.1. What should an agency do if its indirect\ncost rate expires or changes during the\naward period? If your agency’s approved indirect cost rate agreement expires\nduring the award period, a current approved rate agreement\nmust be obtained from the cognizant federal agency and\nsubmitted to the COPS Office. The agency must advise the\nCOPS Office of any changes to its approved indirect cost\nrate during the award period and, if necessary, request a\nbudget modification that reflects the rate change. Please\ncontact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist or\nProgram Manager to determine when a budget modifica­\ntion is necessary."
