      "content": "Match Requirement for STOP Formula Grants\nMatch Requirement By statute, a grant made under the STOP Formula Grant Program may not cover more than\n75% of the total costs of the project(s) funded. This includes any amount used by the state for\nadministrative costs. (34 U.S.C. § 10446(f).) The costs of projects for victim services or tribes for\nwhich there is an exception under 34 U.S.C. § 12291(b)(1) do not count toward the total costs of\nthe projects. State governments may satisfy this match requirement with either cash or in-kind\nservices and may require subgrantees, except victim service providers or tribes, to provide all or\npart of the match. The purpose of matching funds is to augment the amount of resources available to the project\nfrom grant funds and to foster the dedication of state, local, and community resources to the\npurposes of the project. The costs of activities counted as match must be directly related to the\nproject goals and objectives. For example, if half of an advocate's time is supported with grant\nfunds, that advocate must track all of his or her time to demonstrate that 50% of it was devoted\nto the grant-funded project\n• • Under the statute, the state as the direct recipient of program funds is required to meet\nthis match requirement. However, the state may use its discretion to require some or all\nof its subgrantees to meet the match requirement in whole or in part (except victim\nservices providers or tribes). Although victim service providers cannot be required to\nprovide match, they can voluntarily do so. The state is also required to match amounts\nused for administrative costs. We encourage states to take into account the ability of subgrantees to match the Federal\nfunds in deciding whether and how much of the required match to pass on to\nsubgrantees. Source of Match The source of the 25% non-Federal portion of the project is governed by the DOJ Financial\nGuide, 2 C.F.R. 200.306, 28 C.F.R. 90.18, and the STOP Program statute. The following\nprovisions apply to the match requirement:\n• •\n• Funds appropriated by the Congress for the activities of any agency of an Indian tribal\ngovernment or of the Bureau of Indian Affairs performing law enforcement functions on\nany Indian lands may be used to provide the non-Federal share of the cost of programs\nor projects funded under this grant program (34 U.S.C. § 10446(g)) provided that these\ncosts are program related. In-kind match must be documented in the same manner as grant-funded activities. Funds contributed from private sources or state and local governments may be a source\nof match. For example, if the program receives cash donations or money from the United\nWay, this may be used as a source of match. Such funds should be used for program\ncosts which may satisfy the match requirement. Revised February 2020 | 1 In-Kind Match In-kind match may include donations of expendable equipment; office supplies; workshop or\neducation and training materials; work space; or the monetary value of time contributed by\nprofessional and technical personnel and other skilled and unskilled labor, if the services provided\nare an integral and necessary part of a funded project."

      "content": "In-Kind Match In-kind match may include donations of expendable equipment; office supplies; workshop or\neducation and training materials; work space; or the monetary value of time contributed by\nprofessional and technical personnel and other skilled and unskilled labor, if the services provided\nare an integral and necessary part of a funded project. The value placed on loaned equipment\nmay not exceed its fair rental value and the value placed on donated equipment is the fair market\nvalue of the equipment at the time of the donation. The value placed on donated services must be\nconsistent with the rate of compensation paid for similar work in the organization or the labor\nmarket. Fringe benefits may be included in the valuation. Volunteer services must be documented\nand, to the extent feasible, supported by the same valuation methods used by the recipient\norganization for its own employees. The value of donated space may not exceed the fair rental\nvalue of comparable space, as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and\nfacilities in a privately owned building in the same locality. The value for donated supplies shall be\nreasonable and not exceed the fair market value at the time of the donation. The basis for\ndetermining the value of personal services, materials, equipment, and space must be\ndocumented. Following are some specific examples of possible sources of match for this program: For the state:\n• If the state provides office space for the project, the cost of utilities, insurance, security,\njanitorial services and the like may be used as in-kind match to the extent they are not\nbeing paid out of Federal funds (including through indirect costs). If the office space is\ndonated by an outside source, the rental value of the space also may be used as match. • The salaries of any state employees that are working on grant-related purposes but are not\npaid with grant funds may be used. For example, if the state is paying the STOP\nadministrator out of non-Federal funds, the administrator's salary may be used as match. Also, if any of the administrator's support staff are paid with non-Federal funds (and are not\nincluded in indirect costs charged to the grant), then those salaries also may be used as\nmatch to the extent that the staff are working on the grant project. In addition, fringe\nbenefits of state employees working on the project may be used as match if they are not\ncovered by Federal funds. • If the project has an advisory council, such as a group that meets to develop the state's\nimplementation plan, and the members are not compensated for their time, the time spent\nby those members may be used as match. In addition, related meeting costs, such as\ntransportation costs and preparation time of the members, may be used as match to the\nextent they are not covered by Federal funds. Any other volunteers involved in the project\nalso may be used as match.\n• Other donated tangible goods that are used for the project, such as donated furniture, may\nbe used as match. For subgrantees:\n•"

For subgrantees:\n• If an entity other than the subgrantee donates office space free of charge to the\nsubgrantee for the project, the fair rental value of the space may be used as match. For\nexample, a police department may donate an office to house a victim advocate from a\ndomestic violence shelter. Similarly, the cost of utilities, insurance, security, janitorial\nservices and the like may be used as in-kind match to the extent they are not being paid\nout of grant or other Federal funds. Programs also may receive short term donations of\nspace, such as a room to hold a meeting or a training event, which may be used as match.\n• The salaries of any employees of the subgrantee that are working on grant-related\npurposes but are not paid with grant funds may be used. For example, a hotline\ncoordinator at a shelter, a police officer or prosecutor working on a sexual assault unit, or\nother employees could be used as match to the extent that they are not paid by Federal\nfunds. Revised February 2020 | 2 • • • If the subgrantee has a board of directors or advisory board and the members are not\ncompensated for their time, the time spent by the council members may be used as match. Any other volunteers involved in the project, such as trainers and speakers, pro bono\nattorneys and other professionals, hotline volunteers, people volunteering to give public\npresentations about the subgrantee or about violence against women, volunteers\nfacilitating support groups, and child care volunteers also may be used as match. The reasonable value of other donated tangible goods that are used by the project may be\nused as match. For example, a program may receive donations of used clothing, the\nreasonable value of which may be used. A funded shelter may also solicit donations both\nfrom individuals and from companies such as supermarkets of food and items such as\nshampoo and toothpaste for use by victims, toys and other supplies such as diapers or\nformula for victims' children, and supplies for the program itself such as furniture or\ncomputers. Subgrantees also may receive donations of services that can be used as match. For\nexample, a local printing company may agree to print some training materials at no cost to\nthe program. Other examples of donated services may include web space and services,\nother computer services, legal services, translation services, telephone services and\naccounting services for the program as well as psychological counseling, job training,\nmedical services, taxi and hotel vouchers, and child care services for victims. The services\ncould be provided by an individual volunteer or by a company. Revised February 2020 | 3"
