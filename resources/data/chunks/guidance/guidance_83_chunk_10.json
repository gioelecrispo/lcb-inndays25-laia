  "chunk_text": "Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days before the award end date. Requests to extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before the official award end date. 8 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nExtension requests received after the expiration date will be considered only when the recipient provides\njustification of extraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance in which an unforeseen\nnatural disaster prevented a recipient from requesting an extension. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time\nextension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the award due to salary and fringe benefits costs that were\nlower than anticipated, your agency may not extend the 36-month funding period for the purpose of expending\nthose excess funds. Recipients are entitled to a maximum of 36 months of federal funding based on the approved\nsalary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining award funds during the\ncloseout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time extension, please contact your\nCOPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency’s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS Office\nTRGP Hiring program award. Award modifications under the program are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in\naccordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.308. For federal awards in excess of $250,000, any modification request involving\nthe reallocation of funding between budget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of\nthe total approved budget requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award\namount or budget modification percentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In\naddition, any budget modification that changes the scope of the project requires prior written approval by the COPS\nOffice. Furthermore, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that results in\nan increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Under federal regulations, you are\nrequired to expend federal funds only as approved in the FCM. Requests to change or alter an award that meet\ncertain threshold requirements must be submitted to the COPS Office for written approval, prior to their purchase\nor implementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it was\noriginally outlined and accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within\nthe original scope of the award."
