The purpose of this subpart is to describe the Bureau’s drug abuse treatment\nprograms for the inmate population, to include drug abuse education, nonresidential drug abuse treatment services, and residential drug abuse\ntreatment programs (RDAP). These services are provided by Psychology\nServices department. § 550.53 Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP). (1) Unit-based component. Inmates must complete a course of activities provided\nby the Psychology Services Department in a treatment unit set apart from the\ngeneral prison population. This component must last at least six months. (3) Community Treatment Services (CTS). Inmates who have completed the unitbased program and (when appropriate) the follow-up treatment and transferred to\na community-based program must complete CTS to have successfully completed\nRDAP and receive incentives [i.e., early release under 18 U.S.C. § 3621(e), if applicable]. The Warden, on the basis of his or her discretion, may find an inmate ineligible for\nparticipation in a community-based program; therefore, the inmate cannot\ncomplete RDAP. (f) Completing the unit-based component of RDAP. To complete the unit-based\ncomponent of RDAP, inmates must have satisfactory attendance and participation\nin all RDAP activities. (g) Expulsion from RDAP. (3) We may return an inmate who withdraws or is removed from RDAP to his/her\nprior institution (if we had transferred the inmate specifically to participate in\nRDAP). § 550.56 Community Treatment Services (CTS)\n(a) For inmates to successfully complete all components of RDAP, they must\nparticipate in CTS. If inmates refuse or fail to complete CTS, they fail RDAP and\nare disqualified for any additional incentives. (b) Inmates with a documented drug use problem who did not choose to\nparticipate in RDAP may be required to participate in CTS as a condition of\nparticipation in a community-based program, with the approval of the Supervisory\nCommunity Treatment Services Coordinator.

Implementing instructions: regular type Table of Contents\nPage 4 Chapter 1. EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT IN THE BUREAU OF PRISONS\n1.1. The Bureau’s Commitment. The Bureau is committed to providing high-quality, evidencebased psychology programs to all inmates in need of these services. Bureau Psychology\nTreatment Programs (PTP) are designed using the most recent research and evidence-based\npractices. These practices lead to:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Reduction of inmate misconduct. Reduction of inmate mental illness and behavioral disorders. Reduction of substance abuse, relapse, and recidivism. Reduction of criminal activity. An increase in the level of the inmate’s stake in societal norms. An increase in standardized community transition Treatment Programs. Transition treatment\nincreases the likelihood of treatment success and increases the public’s health and safety. 1.2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The Bureau’s PTPs are unified clinical services and\nactivities organized to treat complex psychological and behavioral problems. The Bureau has\nchosen CBT as its theoretical model because of its proven effectiveness with inmate populations. According to the CBT model, a person’s feelings and behaviors are influenced by his or her\nperceptions and core beliefs. By helping inmates perceive events objectively and modify their\nirrational beliefs, they may become more successful in achieving pro-social goals. CBT combines different treatment targets and specific conforming behaviors, focusing on an\ninmate’s:\n•\n•\n•\n• Core beliefs. Intermediate beliefs. Current situation. Automatic thoughts, and the effects these thoughts and beliefs have on an emotional,\nbehavioral, and psychological level. As an example, inmates’ ongoing criminal behavior is conceived, supported, and perpetuated by a\nset of habitual thinking errors: both criminal thinking and cognitive thinking errors. Using CBT,\nthe Bureau is able to treat inmates by replacing those thinking errors with pro-social thinking. Such thinking supports behaviors that are consistent with the norms of a law-abiding community. 1.3. CBT Treatment Protocols. Using CBT underpinnings, the Bureau has created evidencebased treatment protocols (program journals, manuals, facilitator guides, etc.), for many of its\nPTPs. As treatment technologies change, there are opportunities to improve the Bureau’s\ntreatment programs. Therefore, staff are to use the most current journals, facilitators’ guides,\nmanuals, and resources developed by the Central Office. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type.

Therefore, staff are to use the most current journals, facilitators’ guides,\nmanuals, and resources developed by the Central Office. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 1\nPage 1 Other treatment protocols may be used in addition to the specified program protocols. These\nprogram additions must be CBT-based or compatible with CBT, and meet the goals of the\ntreatment program (e.g., Motivational Interviewing, Cognitive Mapping, Dialectical Behavior\nTherapy, and 12-Step Programming). Additions must be approved by the PTP Coordinator, in\nconsultation with the Regional Psychology Treatment Programs Coordinator (RPTP-C), formerly\nknown as the Regional Drug Abuse Programs Coordinator. While self-help programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and\nRational Recovery (RR) may be offered as part of an institution’s drug abuse program effort, they\nare most often associated with non-residential (NR) treatment. While such programs are often\npowerful and important interventions in an inmate’s recovery, they do not substitute for NR or\nresidential treatment hours. They are considered a support to the Bureau’s treatment protocols. 1.4. Program Support. Except in emergency situations (i.e., those for which institution\nemergency plans are written and other events such as assaults and body alarms where an\nimmediate response is required), positions allocated and funded specifically to provide drug abuse\ntreatment are assigned exclusively for providing this programming. These staff are not used for\nother duties (e.g., routine custody, unit, or case management functions). All institution staff are to be informed of Residential Treatment Program operations, and play a\nrole in support of them. 1.5. Residential Treatment Programs. Residential-based Treatment Programs in the Bureau\nfollow the unit-based treatment model of a modified therapeutic community. This model has been\nproven effective in reducing inmate recidivism. A modified therapeutic community in a prison\nsetting stresses pro-social values and behaviors that are needed in the outside community. 1.6. Core Program Elements. Prison Treatment Programs with successful outcomes apply\nspecific core elements. These elements are implemented in various ways, depending on the\ninstitutional environment and culture (e.g., physical layout, administrative support, allowable\nachievement awards). Sound security practices are strictly adhered to when performing treatment\nfunctions. The core elements in operating a Residential program call for:\n1.6.1. Administrative Elements\na. Separate Unit. Residential Treatment Programs are to be separated from the general\npopulation in a separate treatment unit. A separate unit facilitates a positive peer culture and\nreduces negative peer influences. b. Unit Layout. If allowed by the institution layout, the program staff and unit team will have\noffices on the treatment unit. Group sessions and meetings, when possible, are conducted on the\nunit. It is expected that the physical environment of the treatment unit reflects and supports the\nprogram concepts and goals. For example, the walls of the treatment unit should display signs,\nP5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 1\nPage 2 posters, paintings, etc., that reinforce key concepts, such as the Program Philosophy and Program\nAttitudes. 1.6.2 Clinical Elements\na. Diagnoses. The Treatment Program Coordinator will diagnose each inmate through an\nestablished assessment diagnostic process. b. Individual Treatment Plan. Together with the inmate, treatment specialists will develop\nindividual treatment plans for each inmate."

The Treatment Program Coordinator will diagnose each inmate through an\nestablished assessment diagnostic process. b. Individual Treatment Plan. Together with the inmate, treatment specialists will develop\nindividual treatment plans for each inmate. In programs where there are no treatment specialists\n(e.g., the Habilitation program) the Psychologist will develop an individual treatment plan for\neach inmate, based on the CBT theory. Program activities will support the CBT theory and\ninclude the content of program journals. The treatment plan will be completed 30 working days\nfrom the inmate’s admission into the residential program. c. Target Criminogenic Need. Successful programs target criminogenic needs, such as\nantisocial attitudes and beliefs to reduce the likelihood of misconduct and recidivism. d. Therapeutic Activities. All treatment staff will promote activities that have a therapeutic\nimpact in the treatment community. Examples include promoting positive peer pressure and peer\nfeedback, participants assisting one another in meeting their goals, changing negative attitudes to\npositive ones through activities such as attitude checks, conducting daily community meetings,\netc.\ne. Program Monitoring. All treatment staff will be knowledgeable about the treatment progress\nof all program participants. This diminishes inmate manipulation. f. Treatment Team. All treatment staff are involved in discussing progress and commitment to\nthe program of individual participants during treatment team meetings. g. Clinical Supervision. The Treatment Program Coordinator is responsible for clinical\nsupervision of Treatment Specialists. Supervision is conducted no less than one time a month and\nmust be documented. Clinical supervision focuses on the development of the Treatment\nSpecialist as an interpersonally effective clinician. Supervision includes instruction, supervisor\nmodeling, direct observation, intervention by the supervisor in the actual process, and feedback. On occasion, clinical supervision may be offered in a group setting, such as a treatment team\nmeeting. 1.6.3. Operational Elements\na. Program Philosophy. Each Residential Treatment Program develops a program philosophy\nthat will become a permanent community ritual. An example of a program philosophy is written\nbelow. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 1\nPage 3 FCI XXXX, TREATMENT PROGRAM PHILOSOPHY:\nLeader: We believe we have come together to share our common experiences and build positive, prosocial lifestyles together in our Modified Therapeutic Community (MTC). Group Response:\n• We believe (punctuated with volume) we together have much to offer. • We believe (punctuated with volume) learning is most effective when it is experienced and shared. • We believe (punctuated with volume) in the social experience as a catalyst for change. (Emphasized with upbeat tone and volume) MTC, the Power of WE. b. Rules and Consequences. Treatment staff must establish clear, unambiguous rules and\nconsequences for breaking the rules. Staff must ensure that inmates are aware of what they are\nagreeing to on the Agreement to Participate. For example, inmates are reminded that immediate\nexpulsion will likely occur (and is mandatory in the Residential Drug Abuse Program) if the DHO\nfinds that they have committed a prohibited act involving:\n•\n•\n•\n• Alcohol or substances. Violence or threats of violence. Escape or attempted escape. Any 100-level series incident."

Violence or threats of violence. Escape or attempted escape. Any 100-level series incident. Furthermore, an inmate is reviewed for immediate expulsion if he/she has been found to break\nconfidentiality or his/her behavior is of such magnitude that his/her continued presence in\nprogramming would create an immediate and ongoing disruption for staff or other inmates. Ordinarily, the recommendation for expulsion is made by the treatment team. The Treatment\nCoordinator has the final authority to expel an inmate. NOTE: In some instances a mentally ill inmate may be placed in a residential mental health\ntreatment program (e.g., Challenge, Step Down) for management reasons. In these instances an\nAgreement to Participate is not required, but the inmate must be informed of program\nexpectations. Before participation in any treatment group, the Agreement to Participate must be\nsigned. c. Behavioral Contingencies. All treatment staff stress a system of incentives and sanctions that\nfoster desirable behaviors and deter undesirable ones. d. Program Rituals. Each residential treatment community has program rituals to mark group\nand individual milestones. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 1\nPage 4 1.6.4. Caseload Organization. The Treatment Program Coordinator assigns caseloads to\ntreatment staff. In programs with Treatment Specialists, each Specialist is assigned a caseload\nand provides the following documentation for each participant on his/her caseload:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Initial screening for program admission. Assessment(s) (primarily the psychosocial assessment). Treatment plan. Progress reviews. Discharge note. Treatment summary. Each Treatment Specialist is responsible for a caseload based on that program’s staff-to-inmate\nratio. Treatment Specialists should not oversee the treatment of a single group through the entire\nprogram; each Specialist facilitates a variety of groups. Facilitating a variety of groups provides the opportunity for each Treatment Specialist to get to\nknow all participants and treatment modules. Similarly, all participants are exposed to each\nmember of the treatment team, allowing them to experience differing treatment styles. Ordinarily, when conducting individual treatment, sessions are conducted by the participant’s\nprimary Treatment Specialist. 1.6.5. Community Meetings. All Residential Treatment Programs will conduct a daily\ncommunity meeting (excluding non-program days, such as weekends and holidays). With a large\nprogram, two community meetings may be held. All treatment staff will attend daily community meetings. Inmates in the unit at the time of the meeting are required to attend and participate. If space is\navailable, the community meeting is held on the unit; otherwise, an appropriate meeting space is\nidentified. The time of the community meeting is determined by the Treatment Coordinator, who considers\nthe setting, schedule, and needs of the institution. The meeting is brief, generally 30-60 minutes,\nand supervised by the assigned Treatment Specialists. The community meeting strives to motivate the participants to adopt a positive attitude. It also\nstrengthens the awareness that they are in the change process together, as a community. To ensure\nprogram structure, meetings typically are held at the same time each day."

However, in Mental Health\nTreatment Programs staff may take a more active role in facilitating the meeting. 1.6.6. More Than One Residential Treatment Program Coordinator. Institutions with two\ntreatment Program Coordinators are encouraged to create two programs in consultation with and\nthe approval of the Regional Psychology Treatment Program Coordinator. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 1\nPage 6 CHAPTER 2. DRUG ABUSE PROGRAMS\n§ 550.50 PURPOSE AND SCOPE. The purpose of this subpart is to describe the Bureau’s drug abuse treatment\nprograms. All Bureau institutions have a drug abuse treatment specialist who,\nunder the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator’s supervision, provides drug abuse\neducation and non-residential drug abuse treatment services to the inmate\npopulation. Institutions with residential drug abuse treatment programs (RDAP)\nshould have additional drug abuse treatment specialists to provide treatment\nservices in the RDAP unit. 2.1. Structured Drug Abuse Treatment Program. The Bureau operates a structured Drug\nAbuse Treatment Program to identify inmates in need of substance abuse treatment upon entry\nand throughout their incarceration. This multi-pronged treatment delivery system accommodates\nthe entire spectrum of inmates in need of substance abuse programs through the Drug Abuse\nEducation Course, the Non-residential Treatment Program, Residential Drug Abuse Programs\n(RDAP), Follow-up Treatment in general population, and Community Transitional Drug Abuse\nTreatment (TDAT). 2.2. Treatment Protocols. Central Office Psychology Services Branch approves all required\ntreatment protocols (e.g., clinical treatment modules, journals, and facilitator guides) used in\nsubstance abuse programs. A current list of required materials is available on the Psychology\nServices Sallyport site or through Drug Abuse Treatment Programs staff in Central Office. Field\nstaff will be trained on the vital elements of substance treatment protocols as changes occur. 2.3. Drug Abuse Education Course\n2.3.1. Purpose. § 550.51 DRUG ABUSE EDUCATION COURSE. (a) Purpose of the drug abuse education course. All institutions provide a drug\nabuse education course to:\n(1) Inform inmates of the consequences of drug/alcohol abuse and addiction; and\n(2) Motivate inmates needing drug abuse treatment to apply for further drug abuse\ntreatment, both while incarcerated and after release. The Drug Abuse Education course (DRUG ED) is available to all sentenced inmates at every\ninstitution. 2.3.2. Target Population. Inmates who meet the criteria outlined below and have been\nsentenced or returned to custody as a violator are required to take the DRUG ED course. These\ninmates are identified by the unit team through their initial file review. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type.

(1) Inmates will get primary consideration for course placement if they were\nsentenced or returned to custody as a violator after September 30, 1991, when unit\nand/or drug abuse treatment staff determine, through interviews and file review\nthat:\n(i) There is evidence that alcohol or other drug use contributed to the commission\nof the offense;\n(ii) Alcohol or other drug use was a reason for violation either of supervised\nrelease (including parole) or Bureau community status; that is, RRC placement for\nwhich the inmate is now incarcerated;\n(iii) There was a recommendation (or evaluation) for drug programming during\nincarceration by the sentencing judge; or\n(iv) There is evidence of a history of alcohol or other drug use. For example, the\ninmate’s history of alcohol and/or drug use within the past 5 years is emphasized in the\nPresentence Investigation Report (PSR). (2) Inmates may also be considered for course placement if they request to\nparticipate in the drug abuse education program but do not meet the criteria of\nparagraph (b)(1) of this section.

Inmates will only be admitted to the drug abuse education course if\nthey agree to comply with all Bureau requirements for the program. 2.3.3. Volunteers. Inmates may volunteer for DRUG ED; however, inmates who are required to\nparticipate in the DRUG ED course are to receive priority placement. NOTE: If an inmate who has been exempted from DRUG ED as noted in (ii) above, later fails, or\nwithdraws from the RDAP without having completed the DRUG ED course, he or she must be\nplaced back on the waiting list.

The specialist will:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Inform the inmate of the reason they were identified for Drug Education. Inform the inmate of the sanctions for non-participation (see Section 2.3.6). Obtain the inmate’s signature on the Agreement to Participate in the DRUG ED Course. Enter the appropriate DRUG ED SENTRY DRG assignment for the inmate. Notify appropriate staff of sanctions for non-participation. d. Enrollment Time Frame. Because DRUG ED is intended to motivate inmates to volunteer\nfor treatment interventions, it is essential that the DRUG ED course is provided at the beginning\nof the inmate’s sentence, ordinarily within 12 months of his or her current commitment. 2.3.6. Drug Abuse Education Operation.\na. Course Content. The DRUG ED course is 12 to15 hours in duration. The course reviews\npersonal drug use, the cycle of drug use and crime, and reviews additional program opportunities\nin the Bureau. As in other drug abuse program areas, a journal, facilitator guide, and resource\nmaterials have been developed for DRUG ED. Staff are to use the most current journals,\nfacilitator guides, manuals, and resources developed by the Central Office. b. Testing and Security. A bank of 50 test questions is available to staff through the Psychology\nServices Sallyport site (or using appropriate future technology). The DRUG ED exam will P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 2\nPage 3 include 10 questions. The DAPC, or designee, is responsible for the selection of these 10\nquestions. The results of all DRUG ED test scores are to be entered into the Psychology Data\nSystem (PDS). Under no circumstances are inmates permitted to engage in test administration or the handling of\ntest materials. Any compromise in testing procedures must be reported immediately to the\nRegional Psychology Programs Coordinator via e-mail. The Regional Psychology Programs\nCoordinator will, in coordination with the institution DAPC and DTS staff, determine what, if\nany, changes in test security, testing procedures, or testing document must be made. c. Special Circumstances. Inmates who volunteer for or are required to participate in the DRUG\nED course and who experience cognitive impairment or a severe learning disability must be\nprovided a reasonable accommodation toward completion of the DRUG ED course, including an\nalternate means of testing. d. Completion. § 550.51(d). To complete the drug abuse education course, inmates\nmust attend and participate during course sessions and pass a final course exam. Inmates will ordinarily have at least three chances to pass the final course exam\nbefore they lose privileges or the effects of non-participation occur (see paragraph\n(e) of this section). Completion of the DRUG ED course requires attendance of 12 to 15\nhours, participation during sessions and successfully completing the course with 70% correct\nanswers on the test.

Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 2\nPage 4 2.4. Non-residential Drug Abuse Treatment Programs\n§ 550.52 Non-residential drug abuse treatment services. All institutions must\nhave non-residential drug abuse treatment services, provided through the\ninstitution's Psychology Services department. These services are available to\ninmates who voluntarily decide to participate. 2.4.1. Purpose. The non-residential drug abuse treatment program (NR DAP) is available to\ninmates at every institution. The purpose of the NR DAP program is to afford all inmates with a\ndrug problem the opportunity to receive drug treatment. 2.4.2. Target Population. NR DAP is targeted to inmates who:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Are waiting to enter the RDAP. Do not meet the admission criteria for the RDAP, but who wish to benefit from less\nintensive drug abuse treatment services. Have been referred by other psychology or institution staff for drug abuse treatment. Have a judicial recommendation for drug treatment, but do not want or do not meet the\ncriteria for the RDAP. Received detoxification from alcohol or drugs upon entering Bureau confinement. Have been found guilty of an incident report for use of alcohol or other drugs. 2.4.3. Programming. Treatment staff are required to use the most recent treatment journals,\nfacilitator guides, manuals, and resource materials. As treatment technologies change, there are\nopportunities to improve the Bureau’s treatment programs. Therefore, staff are to use the most\ncurrent journals, facilitator guides, manuals and resources developed by the Central Office. While self-help programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and\nRational Recovery (RR) may be offered as part of an institution’s drug abuse program effort, they\nare most often associated with non-residential (NR) treatment. While such programs are often\npowerful and important interventions in an inmate’s recovery, they do not substitute for NR DAP\nor residential treatment hours. They are considered a support to the Bureau’s treatment protocols. 2.4.4. Duration. NR DAPs are conducted 90 to 120 minutes a week for a minimum of 12 weeks\nand a maximum of 24 weeks. Reasonable efforts will be made to foster a continuity of treatment\nby conducting weekly groups."

The 90 to 120 minutes may be broken up into more than one session per week. 2.4.5. Program Operations and Management. Under the administrative supervision of the\nDAPC, the DTS is responsible for identifying and treating inmates in NR DAP. a. Identification. In addition to volunteers, inmates are identified for the NR DAP program\nthrough the Psychology Intake Screening interview. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 2\nPage 5 The psychologist conducting the Psychology Intake Screening will determine if the inmate is\ninterested in participating in NR DAP. If so, the psychologist will select “NR DAP” in the\n“Program/Treatment Recommendations & Interest” section of the Intake Screening Report in\nPDS. Monthly, the DAPC or designee will run a PDS report that lists those inmates who were identified\nas having an interest in NR DAP. The DTS will interview the inmates. If there is a question as to whether the inmate is able to\nfunction at an 8th grade level, the DTS will notify the DAPC as to the reasons; e.g., has no\ncognitive impairment, cannot comprehend the English language, etc. (See 28 CFR §§ 544.40544.44.) The DAPC will refer the inmate to Education for testing. Education staff will notify the DAPC\nvia email of the outcome of the testing. The DAPC will apprise the DTS. Those inmates who qualify and agree to participate will be asked to sign the Agreement to\nParticipate in the Bureau of Prisons Non-Residential Drug Abuse Treatment (BP-A0748). The\nDTS will then enter the appropriate SENTRY code. b. RDAP Volunteers and Completers\n(1) In institutions without RDAPs the procedures outlined in Chapter Two, section 2.5.8, RDAP\nAdmissions and Screening Procedures will be followed. (2) DTS’s must identify inmates who have completed the RDAP and no later than the month\nfollowing their arrival at the facility, these inmates must begin Follow-up treatment (see Section\n2.7). 2.4.6. Program Documentation. Required documentation to be completed by the DTS for the\nNR DAP program includes:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• The approved psychosocial assessment on each inmate entering the NR DAP program to\nassist in the development of an individualized treatment plan. An individualized treatment plan for each NR DAP program participant will be completed\nwithin 30 days of entering the program, documenting the targeted problem areas, treatment\ngoals, and treatment activities in PDS. The recording of an inmate’s participation in group. Treatment contact notes when appropriate. A minimum of one progress review must be completed during the course of the inmates’\ntreatment.

Expulsion. Inmates may be removed from the program by the DAPC because of\ndisruptive behavior related to the program or unsatisfactory progress in treatment. 2.4.8. Achievement Awards. In coordination with the Warden, the drug treatment team will\ndetermine program achievement awards to be offered at the institution. A non-exhaustive list of\npossible incentives are listed below. a. Limited Achievement Awards. When the participant successfully completes a NR DAP\nprogram, he or she may be awarded $30. This award will be pro-rated based on the inmate’s\nparticipation, but may never be adjusted higher. In determining the amount of the drug treatment\naward, the drug treatment staff must consider the following. The inmate must:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Be on time for group. Have no unexcused absences. Obtain satisfactory work performance. Maintain satisfactory sanitation requirements for the institution. Be Financial Responsibility Program (FRP) compliant. Maintain clear conduct. Not leave group without permission from the DTS(s) overseeing the group. Not eat, drink, or sleep in group. Complete all assigned activities. Dress appropriately, (i.e., clean institutional clothing, shirttails tucked in, shoes tied, no\nheadphones, properly fitting pants with belts, no sunglasses, no coats or jackets, and no head\ncovering other than approved religious headwear). Participate and progress in treatment. b. Residential Reentry Center (RRC) Placement. Each Warden is strongly encouraged to\napprove inmates who successfully complete the non-residential drug abuse program for the\nmaximum period of RRC placement. On occasion, administrative factors (e.g., bedspace\nlimitations at a RRC) or community safety concerns (i.e., exclusionary criteria) occur that require\nconsideration for a RRC placement of more or less than the recommended number of days. When\nthis occurs, the goal for both the Warden and Community Corrections Manager (CCM) is to seek\nthe best possible placement for the RRC period without negatively impacting bedspace limitations\nin contract facilities or jeopardizing community safety. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 2\nPage 7 c. Tangible Incentives. If the Warden allows, incentives such as books, t-shirts, greeting cards,\nnotebooks, pens, etc., may be presented to inmates participating in the non-residential drug abuse\nprogram. 2.5. § 550.53 Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP). 2.5.1. Target Population. The RDAP targets the inmate who volunteers for treatment and has a\ndiagnosable and verifiable substance use disorder, and is able to participate in the entire RDAP. (a) RDAP.

To successfully complete the RDAP, inmates must complete each of\nthe following components:\n(1) Unit-based component. Inmates must complete a course of activities provided\nby drug abuse treatment specialists and the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator in a\ntreatment unit set apart from the general prison population. This component must\nlast at least six months. To ensure the Bureau provides evidence based treatment in its drug\nabuse treatment programs, the RDAP is a minimum of 500 hours. The RDAP has a duration of 9\nto 12 months. (2) Follow-up services. If time allows between completion of the unit-based\ncomponent of the RDAP and transfer to a community-based program, inmates\nmust participate in the follow-up services to the unit-based component of the\nRDAP. (3) Transitional drug abuse treatment (TDAT) component. Inmates who have\ncompleted the unit-based program and (when appropriate) the follow-up treatment\nand are transferred to community confinement must successfully complete\ncommunity-based drug abuse treatment in a community-based program to have\nsuccessfully completed RDAP. The Warden, on the basis of his or her discretion,\nmay find an inmate ineligible for participation in a community-based program. (b) Admission Criteria. Inmates must meet all of the following criteria to be\nadmitted into RDAP. a. (1) Inmates must have a verifiable substance use disorder. b. (2) Inmates must sign an agreement acknowledging program responsibility. c. (3) When beginning the program, the inmate must be able to complete all three\ncomponents described in paragraph (a) of this section. This includes the critical RRC\nor home confinement transfer to participate in the TDAT. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 2\nPage 8 Example 1: A deportable inmate is unqualified for the RDAP because he or she cannot participate\nin the transitional drug abuse treatment component because he or she is not eligible for RRC\nplacement. The NR DAP program is available for these unqualified inmates. An inmate previously determined DAP UNQUALIFIED due to his or her ineligibility for an RRC\nis responsible for notifying the drug abuse treatment staff if there is a change in the inmate’s RRC\nstatus for reconsideration. Example 2: If an inmate is found to be qualified for the RDAP and has begun to participate in the\nprogram, and then finds his or her RRC status to have changed; e.g., a detainer lodged, he or she\nmay remain in treatment. Inmates who are waiting for, or participating in the RDAP who are not eligible for transfer to an\nRRC, on or before the date of this policy’s implementation, will remain qualified for RDAP\nparticipation; and\nd. Ordinarily, have 24 months or more remaining on their sentence. 2.5.2. Staffing. With the exception of the co-occurring drug abuse treatment program as outlined\nin Section 2.5.3, DTSs will always maintain a caseload of 1:24.

The Bureau also operates RDAPs for inmates with cooccurring substance use and serious mental health disorders. Questions and referrals for inmates\nwith co-occurring disorders are directed to the Regional Psychology Programs Coordinator. RDAPs that include inmates with co-occurring disorders follow the same programming, policies,\nand practices of an RDAP with the following exceptions:\n• There is an additional track for inmates with a co-occurring diagnosis that focuses on\nunderstanding one’s disorder, issues with self-medicating and how to manage prescribed\nmedications and medication compliance. • There is a staff-to-inmate ratio of 1-to-8 for the DTSs who treat and manage these groups. 2.5.4. Physical/Medical Populations. Inmates who volunteer for RDAPs and have physical\ndisabilities or medical conditions that require their assignment to a unit other than the RDAP unit\nto ensure handicap accessibility or medical monitoring may be qualified for the RDAP if the\ninmate is:\n• Otherwise eligible for the RDAP, including eligibility for transitional drug abuse treatment;\ni.e., an RRC or home confinement placement. • Able to fully participate in all aspects of the RDAP. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 2\nPage 9 • Able to be held accountable to the same standard of treatment and conduct as all other RDAP\nparticipants (e.g., complete homework, participate in all assigned groups, behavior consistent\nwith treatment requirements). Although Health Services staff are always the final decision-maker regarding an inmate’s\nplacement outside of the drug treatment unit for medical reasons, drug abuse treatment staff are\nresponsible for identifying, monitoring, and documenting this exception in the inmate’s DAP\nrecords. Ordinarily, these inmates are excused from residential drug treatment unit activities only\nfor reasons of sleep and unit accountability purposes (special census counts, etc.). 2.5.5. Referral and Redesignation. An inmate’s initial designation will be made by the\nDesignation and Sentence Classification Center (DSCC) in Grand Prairie, Texas. Institution DAP Coordinators and Regional Psychology Program Coordinators will monitor\nwaiting lists to ensure inmates are transferred for RDAP with sufficient time to complete the\nentire RDAP program before their release from Bureau custody, ordinarily at 24 months. Inmates are to be informed that they may be transferred to any suitable Bureau RDAP based on\ntheir release date. This notification is included in the Agreement to Participate for the RDAP. Inmates waiting to enter the RDAP who are living on the treatment unit or on an adjacent unit are\nto adhere to the same unit rules and decorum as those inmates participating in the RDAP. Ordinarily, if these inmates do not follow the rules and decorum of the RDAP unit, (e.g.,\nnegatively impacting other RDAP participants and/or those waiting for RDAP), they will receive a\nwarning of removal from the RDAP waiting list. This warning will be made during a treatment\nteam meeting with all staff involved in the process. The DAPC, or designee, will document this\nwarning in PDS."

If the inmate’s behavior does not change, he or she will be removed from the RDAP waiting list. Treatment staff will change the inmate’s appropriate SENTRY assignment and document the\nremoval in PDS. After six months, the inmate may formally reapply for RDAP, through an Inmate Request to Staff\nform (BP-A0148). The application will be considered in a treatment team meeting with the\ninmate. The goal of this meeting is to assess any changes in attitude or behavior that the applicant\nmay have made while awaiting re-consideration for the RDAP. The treatment team will make the\ndecision regarding the inmate’s placement on the waiting list. 2.5.6. The RDAP Housing Unit. RDAPs are separated from the inmate general population. By\nliving together in a unit where all inmates work together to create a community that supports prosocial attitudes and behaviors, the RDAP unit isolates program participants from the negative peer\npressure of the larger prison environment. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 2\nPage 10 Further, the RDAP unit must be solely for RDAP participants, as required by 18 U.S.C. § 3621(e). Inmates living on the RDAP unit must be: waiting for admission into the program; participating in\nthe program; or RDAP completers. Whenever possible, there should be more inmates who are\nparticipating in or who have completed RDAP in the treatment unit than those waiting to enter\ntreatment. Any compromise of this defined unit purity will invalidate eligibility for early release\nof all inmates on the unit. 2.5.7. Urine Surveillance. Urine surveillance is a regular component of effective treatment\nprogramming. Urine surveillance provides information to staff on an RDAP participant’s\nabstinence, coping mechanisms, and honesty. The Bureau’s urine surveillance procedures allow\nfor random testing, suspect testing, and testing after returning from a furlough. Therefore,\ninmates in the RDAP are subjected to the same urine surveillance procedures as the general\npopulation. On rare occasions there may be a clinical reason to test individual program participants or the\nentire population of the program. On these infrequent occasions, and with the permission of the\nRegional Psychology Programs Coordinator, staff may use program funds for urinalysis testing. However, this is to be an extremely rare event and is the only situation where Drug Abuse\nProgram funds may be used for urinalysis testing. 2.5.8. RDAP Program Admission. § 550.53(c) Application to RDAP. Inmates may\napply for the RDAP by submitting requests to a staff member (ordinarily, a\nmember of the unit team or the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator). (d) Referral to RDAP.

Typically, inmates are identified for referral to the\nRDAP by psychology staff or unit management staff. (1) Referral to DAPC.

The Drug Abuse\nProgram Coordinator decides whether to place inmates in RDAP based on the\ncriteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If verifying documentation is found or produced, and only then, inmates who volunteer for the\nRDAP will be personally interviewed by the DAPC. Interviews will be conducted based on the\ninmate’s proximity to release, ordinarily no less than 24 months from release."

All verifying\ndocumentation used is to be consistent in time, intensity, and duration with the inmate’s selfreport. On the basis of the clinical interview, the DAPC may conclude that the inmate either does or does\nnot have a diagnosis of a substance use disorder. In some instances, the DAPC may find the\ninmate does not have a diagnosis, even if there is substantiating documentation. The DAPC must also determine if the inmate can fully engage in treatment; i.e., communicate in\nEnglish and/or comprehend treatment expectations. An example of those who may not\ncomprehend treatment expectations is an inmate who is cognitively impaired or has a severe\nlearning disability. In some instances, the DAPC may find the inmate cannot fully engage in\ntreatment and does not qualify for the program, even if there is substantiating documentation (see\n18 U.S.C. § 3624(f)(4) and 28 CFR §§ 544.40 - 544.44). The DAPC will document the result of the clinical interview in PDS, including the substance use\ndiagnosis and the diagnostic criteria used to formulate the diagnosis and notify the inmate of the\noutcome. The DAPC will also ensure the appropriate SENTRY code(s) are entered and the\nappropriate documents are signed. Appropriate documentation includes the Agreement to\nParticipate in the Bureau of Prisons Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program form\n(BP-A0749) and the waiver of hearing to modify the court order (modification of the court order\nis completed on an inmate with a condition of supervised release that does not include a treatment\nstipulation).

Supplemental treatment activities may occur during weekday evenings;\nhowever, evening treatment activities cannot be used to replace treatment during day watch hours. Treatment begins as soon as the inmate is in DAP PART status in SENTRY. Treatment staff are required to use the RDAP treatment journals, facilitator guides, manuals, and\nresource materials. As effective treatment technologies advance, treatment materials may be\nP5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 2\nPage 14 revised. Therefore, only the most current drug program materials, journals, facilitator guides, etc.,\nare to be used. Additional programming may be used in the RDAP as approved by the DAPC in consultation\nwith the Regional Psychology Treatment Program Coordinator (R-PTPC). The added treatment\nprogramming must be Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-based (CBT) or consistent with CBT and\nmeet the goals stated within each of the RDAP treatment phases and modules. 2.5.11. Treatment Phases. All Bureau RDAPs are to be organized in phases. Each RDAP phase\nfollows a clearly defined structure. Inmate movement through phases is based on his/her progress\nas determined by the inmate’s treatment team. In the Bureau’s RDAP, phases are organized as\nfollows:\nPhase I - The Orientation Phase. Institutions are to provide an orientation packet that outlines the Bureau treatment program. In\naddition, any rules and/or expectations required by the RDAP in the institution will also be\ndocumented in the orientation packet. During the Orientation Phase of treatment a thorough psychosocial assessment is conducted by the\nTreatment Specialist (see Sallyport). During the Orientation Phase of treatment, DTS’s are to:\n• Strive to build rapport and motivate the inmate to engage in treatment. • Conduct the psychosocial assessment (this guides the development of the treatment plan). The\ntreatment assessment must be conducted with the inmate. It is not a self-assessment\ninstrument (see Sallyport). • Present the inmate’s case at a treatment team meeting. These meetings are scheduled and\nconducted by the DAPC. The treatment team meeting is to assist with the development of the\ninmate’s treatment plan. • Attend additional team meetings. These meetings provide the opportunity for staff to discuss\neach individual inmate. These discussions are to review the inmate’s progress in treatment\nand commitment to the program; for example, willingness to conform to the norms of the\nprogram, participate fully in groups, demonstrate positive attitudes, complete a statement that\noutlines his or her readiness for treatment, complete a realistic treatment plan, and learn to\naccept feedback from staff and peers. The Treatment Coordinator will develop a schedule to conduct, at a minimum, at least one weekly\nteam meeting to bring together the entire treatment team. The Treatment Coordinator will invite\nunit management staff for input into updating progress reports, training, and addressing any\nrelated issues.

The first progress report is due 60 days from the completion of the treatment plan. Phase I duration - Ordinarily, Phase I should not last more than two months. Phase II - The Core Treatment Phase. In the Core Treatment Phase, the inmate is expected to build positive relationships in group, on\nthe treatment unit, with family/significant others, with institution staff, etc. Using the treatment journals and facilitator guides developed for the program, staff facilitate the\ninmate’s acquisition of thought processes and pro-social skills required to live a substance-free,\ncrime-free, and well-managed life. Treatment progress reviews are to be completed every 60 days and documented in PDS. In\naddition, treatment staff are to observe program participants regularly on and off the unit (e.g., at\nwork, during main line). This is done to determine if the inmate’s behavior in the program is\nconsistent with his or her behavior throughout the institution. Phase II duration - Ordinarily, the Core Treatment Phase will last no more than five months. Staff\nwill monitor the participants’ behavior, personal insights, motivation, and commitment to\ntreatment daily. Changes in behavior (positive or negative) are to be documented in the\nparticipants’ progress reviews. Phase III - The Transition Phase. Phase III focuses on the inmate practice of pro-social skills acquired in treatment while\ndeveloping realistic expectations for exiting the program. Phase III duration - Ordinarily the Transition Phase will last no more than two months. Inmates\nare not to complete the program until they have mastered the expected behaviors of Phase III. See\n(a) Completion, below. 2.5.12. Program Outcomes. How an inmate leaves a RDAP is based on the inmate’s behavior. (a) Successful Completion. § 550.53(f) Completing the unit-based component of\nRDAP. To complete the unit-based component of RDAP, inmates must:\n(1) Have satisfactory attendance and participation in all RDAP activities; and\n(2) Pass each RDAP testing procedure. Ordinarily, we will allow inmates who fail\nany RDAP exam to retest one time. Testing procedures for completion of any Phase of treatment are to be behavioral in nature.

Two weeks prior to the inmate’s scheduled date for RDAP\ncompletion, the DAPC will ensure the RDAP Treatment Summary is sent to the Unit Team and\nTransitional Drug Abuse Program Coordinator (T-DATC) in the region of release (see example on\nSallyport). The DAPC should review the Treatment Summary for accuracy and completeness,\nand sign it prior to forwarding it to the unit team and T-DATC. (c) Withdrawal/Incomplete. An inmate may withdraw voluntarily from the program. Withdrawals must be documented on the Change in RDAP and § 3621(e) Status form (BPA0767) and forwarded to the Unit Team. If the inmate was previously determined ELIGIBLE, the\nDAPC, or designee, must change SENTRY to reflect ELIGIBLE to INELIGIBLE, change DAP\nPART to the applicable removal code, and forward the Change in RDAP and § 3621(e) Status\nform to the DSCC. An inmate may also be moved to incomplete status for many reasons: placement in the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU), removed from the institution on a writ, unforseen redesignation, etc. An\nincomplete does not mean the inmate is automatically a failure. The DAPC and the treatment\nteam will make the decision on the inmate’s final treatment determination depending on the\nreason for his or her incomplete status. Inmates who do not complete the RDAP for reasons other\nthan expulsion also require a Discharge Note with the reason(s) for non-completion documented\nin the Evaluation section of PDS. At that time the DAPC, or designee, is to make the appropriate\nchanges to the inmate’s SENTRY assignment(s). (d) Intervention and § 550.53(g) Expulsion from RDAP. (1) Inmates may be removed from the program by the Drug Abuse Program\nCoordinator because of disruptive behavior related to the program or\nunsatisfactory progress in treatment.

(c) If an inmate withdraws from or is otherwise removed from RDAP, that inmate\nmay lose incentives he/she previously achieved. Most psychology treatment programs offer achievement awards for inmates who participate. (Programs that do not offer achievement awards are noted within the specific program’s\ndescription.) Achievement awards for RDAP are offered to participants who demonstrate the\nbehaviors that reflect the Attitudes of Change, a commitment to treatment, conformity with\nprogram norms, progress on treatment plan goals, and behaviors that are expected in the general\nsociety. (a) Earning Program Achievement Awards. Inmates must:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Be on time for group. Have no unexcused absences. Not leave group without approval from the Treatment Specialist. Not eat, drink, or sleep in group. Complete all assigned activities. Dress appropriately: clean institutional clothing, shirts tucked in, shoes tied, no headphones,\nno jackets, no coats, properly fitting pants, no sunglasses, and no head covering other than\napproved religious headwear. • Be active in group.\n• Put forth positive efforts in accomplishing treatment goals, as determined by the treatment\nteam within the treatment plan. • Comply with education, Financial Responsibility Program (FRP) obligations, and pre-release\npreparation programs.

For the completion of RDAP, institutions may offer a\nstructured commencement ceremony for the inmates. Pictures of individual inmates or of the\ntreatment group may be allowed for inmates to send to family. Early Release. Details regarding the early release criteria may be found in the Program\nStatement Early Release Procedures Under 18 U.S.C. § 3621(e). Residential Re-entry Center (RRC) Placement. Consideration may be given for up to the\nmaximum period of placement in an RRC to include home confinement. The RRC placement\nallows for the completion of the Community TDAT component of RDAP. Program\ncompletion in the community is a critical component of the RDAP. Each Warden is strongly encouraged to approve inmates who successfully complete the RDAP for\nthe RRC placement. Similarly, CCMs must, when possible, ensure that inmates required to\nparticipate in TDAT are placed in an RRC for the maximum time recommended by the Warden. On occasion, administrative factors (e.g., bedspace limitations at a RRC) or community safety\nconcerns (e.g., exclusionary criteria) occur that require consideration for RRC placement of less\nthan the recommended maximum days. When this occurs, the goal for both the Warden and CCM\nis to seek possible placement for the maximum period without negatively impacting bedspace\nlimitations in contract facilities or jeopardizing community safety. Bureau experience and drug abuse treatment research demonstrate that successful community\ntreatment cannot be completed in less than 120 days. Therefore, inmates who are approved for\nless than a 120-day RRC placement or home confinement cannot ordinarily complete the final\ncomponent of the RDAP, and are, therefore, ineligible for early release. For inmates who would\notherwise be eligible for early release, but who are approved for less than a 120-day RRC\nplacement, the appropriate SENTRY assignment must be changed from ELIGIBLE to\nINELIGIBLE. 3. Effects of Non-participation. In those institutions authorized, inmates may feel the effects of\nnon-participation if they fail to apply for the RDAP. § 550.53(h) Effects of non-participation. (1) If inmates refuse to participate in RDAP, withdraw, or are otherwise removed,\nthey are not eligible for:\nP5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 2\nPage 21 (i) A furlough (other than possibly an emergency furlough);\n(ii) Performance pay above maintenance pay level, bonus pay, or vacation pay;\nand/or\n(iii) A Federal Prison Industries work program assignment (unless the Warden\nmakes an exception on the basis of work program labor needs). (2) Refusal, withdrawal, and/or expulsion will be a factor to consider in\ndetermining length of community confinement. (3) Where applicable, staff will notify the United States Parole Commission of\ninmates’ needs for treatment and any failure to participate in the RDAP. 2.6. Follow-up Treatment\n2.6.1.

These rosters are to\ndetermine if any DAP completers have transferred to the institution without FOL PART. 2.6.2. Follow-up Admission. Inmates enter follow-up treatment within the first month after their\nreturn to general population. The treatment protocol is designed so that inmates may enter the\nmonthly group at any time. Each group will be no less than 60 minutes. If FOL PART is\nconducted individually, the DTS may start with any of the 12 treatment sessions and complete the\nentire cycle as described below. 2.6.3. Follow-up Treatment Refuse or Failure. Any RDAP participant who refuses to\nparticipate in follow-up treatment is an RDAP failure and is disqualified from receiving additional\nachievement awards, (e.g. early release). His or her failure may result in the inmate’s redesignation. The primary DTS is responsible for entering the appropriate SENTRY assignment\nand entering the discharge note into PDS. 2.6.4.

The Resolve Program. In 1993, the Bureau’s Executive Staff approved a model to ensure\nparity of program opportunities for female inmates. This model included the implementation of a\ntrauma treatment program at each female institution. Each institution developed its program\nindependently with limited direction from Central Office, leading to tremendous variability in\nprogram structure and content. In 2004, Executive Staff requested that a single model for trauma treatment be developed and\nimplemented Bureau-wide. After extensive research and consultation with subject matter experts,\nthe Resolve Program was prepared for Bureau-wide implementation in 2007. The Resolve\nProgram consists of two primary components: a psycho-educational workshop and a nonresidential program for inmates with trauma-related disorders. As in all Bureau Psychology Treatment Programs, the Resolve Program is conducted through the\nuse of specific manuals, journals, facilitator guides, and/or other identified resource materials. These Resolve Program materials are drawn from research and practice and are proven effective\nfor use in the treatment of trauma-related disorders. Their use in the program is required. 3.2. Staffing. The Resolve Program is staffed by a psychologist who serves as the Resolve\nProgram Coordinator. The role of Resolve Program Coordinator will be a full-time position. 3.3. The Trauma in Life Workshop\n3.3.1. Purpose. The Trauma in Life Workshop will be provided at all female institutions,\nexcluding Federal Transfer Centers (FTCs), Federal Detention Centers (FDCs), and Metropolitan\nDetention Centers (MDCs). However, FTCs, FDCs, and MDCs may choose to implement this\nprogram element, subject to available resources. It is a psycho-educational workshop that\nprovides female inmates with information on trauma and its potential impact in their lives. The\nworkshop also functions to identify and motivate inmates who need treatment to participate in the\nResolve Program’s non-residential protocol during their incarceration."

The\nworkshop also functions to identify and motivate inmates who need treatment to participate in the\nResolve Program’s non-residential protocol during their incarceration. 3.3.2. Target Population. The Trauma in Life Workshop is designed for inmates who meet any\nof the following three criteria:\n• There is evidence that the inmate has a history of traumatic life events, such as childhood\nabuse or neglect, rape, or domestic violence. • There is evidence that the inmate suffers from an Axis I or Axis II disorder that may be\nassociated with a traumatic life event. • The inmate expresses an interest in learning more about trauma and its potential impact; e.g.,\nan inmate who physically abused her children wants to learn more about the potential impact\nof her actions. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 3\nPage 1 The Trauma in Life Workshop is voluntary. While inmates may be encouraged to enroll in the\nworkshop, they are not required to participate. 3.3.3. Admission Procedures.\na. Program Referral. Psychology Services will ensure inmates receive information about the\nTrauma in Life Workshop. This information is to be offered in a group format during Admission\nand Orientation. In addition, inmates who are appropriate for the workshop should be identified\nduring their Psychology Services Intake Interview and provided with information about the\nworkshop. Inmates who express a willingness to participate in the Trauma in Life Workshop will be referred\nto the Resolve Program Coordinator for placement on the SENTRY waiting list for the workshop\n(RRW WAIT). b. Enrollment Time Frame. Because the Trauma in Life Workshop is intended to motivate\ninmates to volunteer for the Resolve non-residential program, it is essential that the workshop is\nprovided at the beginning of the inmate’s sentence, ordinarily within 12 months of her current\ncommitment. c. Agreement to Participate. At the time of the first workshop meeting, the Resolve Program\nCoordinator will obtain the offender’s signature on the Agreement to Participate in the Resolve\nPsychology Treatment Program form (BP-A0946) and enter the appropriate SENTRY\nassignment. 3.3.4. Treatment Protocol.\na. Course Structure. The required workshop resources are the participant journal and\nfacilitator’s guide, titled Trauma in Life. Use of these materials is required; however, use of\nadditional supplemental materials is acceptable if the content is consistent with the Trauma in Life\nmaterials. Ordinarily, the workshop will consist of four two-hour sessions. A certificate of\ncompletion may be awarded to inmates who complete the program. The Resolve Program\nCoordinator is responsible for conducting the workshop. b. Course Completion. At the conclusion of the workshop, all participants will complete a brief\nself-assessment. The purpose of the assessment is to allow inmates to make an informed decision\nabout their potential need for additional trauma-related treatment. The Resolve Program\nCoordinator will encourage participants with ongoing treatment needs to enroll in the Resolve\nnon-residential Program. Completion of the Trauma in Life Workshop requires attendance and participation during all\ncourse sessions. When an inmate completes the workshop, the appropriate entry will be made in\nSENTRY (RRW COMP). P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type.

Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 3\nPage 2 3.4. The Resolve Non-residential Treatment Program. The Resolve Non-residential\nTreatment Program is a collection of evidenced-based, cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT)\nprotocols tailored to the needs of individual inmates. Specific treatment manuals and resource\nmaterials are required for use in the program. Additional CBT, or CBT-compatible, interventions\nmay be utilized after completion of the required protocols. The Resolve Non-residential Treatment Program is available at all female institutions with a fulltime Resolve Program Coordinator. 3.4.1. Purpose. The purpose of the Resolve Non-residential Treatment Program is to address the\ntreatment needs of a significant segment of the female inmate population: individuals with\npsychological and interpersonal difficulties precipitated by traumatic life experiences. 3.4.2. Target Population. The Resolve Non-residential Treatment Program is designed for\ninmates with a history of trauma and a related psychological disorder. Potential program\nparticipants must:\n• Report a history of a traumatic life event as documented in the screening instrument (e.g., the\nStressful Life Experiences Screening). • Present with an Axis I or Axis II disorder that is related to the traumatic life event. • Complete the Trauma in Life Workshop. 3.4.3. Admission Procedures\na. Program Referral. Inmates who complete the Trauma in Life Workshop and express an\ninterest in additional treatment will be referred for participation in the Resolve Non-residential\nTreatment Program. b. Assessment of Treatment Needs. Prior to enrollment in the Resolve Non-residential\nTreatment Program, inmates will complete a psychosocial assessment interview that includes a\nreview of the inmate’s Trauma in Life journal. As a prerequisite for participation in the program,\nthe inmate must have an Axis I or Axis II disorder related to a traumatic life event. The Resolve\nProgram Coordinator is responsible for conducting a thorough assessment and providing a\ndiagnosis consistent with this prerequisite. Suggested diagnostic tools include the Stressful Life\nExperiences Screening (SLES), a supplemental questionnaire to identify traumatic life\nexperiences not included in the SLES, and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). c. Agreement to Participate. At the time of the first treatment group, the Resolve Program\nCoordinator will obtain the inmate’s signature on the Agreement to Participate in the Resolve\nPsychology Treatment Program form and place them in participation status in SENTRY (RR1\nPART, RR2 PART).

Inmates who participate in the Resolve Non-residential Treatment\nProgram will be provided services in a group format, utilizing standardized evidence-based,\ncognitive-behavioral treatment protocols. The current protocols are located on the Psychology\nServices Branch Sallyport site. The protocols are divided into two phases:\na. Phase I. Phase I emphasizes the acquisition of basic skills, with a focus on coping skills and\ninterpersonal skills. The required protocol is delivered in a group format, with a minimum of 12\ngroup sessions meeting weekly for at least 60 minutes per session. b. Phase II. Phase II of the program consists of specialized groups designed to meet the\nadditional treatment needs of three distinct populations as described below."

Phase II of the program consists of specialized groups designed to meet the\nadditional treatment needs of three distinct populations as described below. Inmates must\ncomplete Phase I of the program before enrolling in Phase II groups. (1) Maintenance Skills Group. Maintenance Skills Group is for inmates who remain interested\nin treatment, but whose symptoms, if present, no longer interfere with daily functioning. This\ngroup utilizes a supportive and educational orientation to maintain treatment gains. The group is\nan open-ended, continuous group. The group meets at least monthly for 60-90 minutes. (2) Cognitive Processing Therapy Group. Cognitive Processing Therapy Group is for inmates\nwho remain symptomatic after completion of Phase I with a primary diagnosis of an Axis I\ndisorder (e.g., Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), major depression, substance use disorder). This group utilizes a highly structured, 12-session treatment protocol combining cognitive\ntechniques with written exposure therapy to address negative affect, intrusive images,\ndysfunctional thoughts, and avoidance behavior. The group meets weekly for 60 to 90 minutes\nper session. In special cases, Cognitive Processing Therapy may also be offered in an individual\nformat. (3) Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training Group. Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills\nTraining Group is for inmates who remain symptomatic after completion of Phase I with a\nprimary diagnosis of an Axis II disorder; e.g., Borderline Personality Disorder. This treatment\nintervention utilizes cognitive-behavioral skills training in emotional regulation, distress\ntolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and core mindfulness. Typically the group meets weekly\nfor 60 to 90 minutes per session. In special cases, Dialectical Behavior Therapy skills may be\noffered in an individual treatment format. As treatment technologies change, there are opportunities to improve the Bureau’s treatment\nprograms. Therefore, staff are to use the most recent manuals, journals, facilitator’s guides, and\nresources developed by the Central Office. 3.4.5. Program Documentation. Required documentation for the Resolve Non-residential\nTreatment Program includes: P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type.

The BRAVE Program. In 1995, following a series of institutional disturbances, Executive\nStaff sought to identify the inmates most likely to engage in disturbances and to develop an\nappropriate intervention. Young, newly committed inmates serving long sentences were\nidentified as the group most likely to engage in both disturbances and general institutional\nmisconduct. In 1998, the Bureau Rehabilitation and Values Enhancement (BRAVE) Program was\nimplemented as an intensive, cognitive-behavioral, residential rehabilitation program for medium\nsecurity inmates. 4.1.1. Purpose. The BRAVE Program is designed to facilitate favorable institutional adjustment\nand reduce incidents of misconduct. In addition, the program encourages inmates to interact\npositively with staff members and take advantage of opportunities to engage in self-improvement\nactivities throughout their incarceration. 4.1.2. Residential Treatment Unit. BRAVE Program participants are to be housed together on a\nunit, separate from general population inmates. Living together in a unit allows all inmates to\nwork together to create a community that supports prosocial attitudes and behaviors. The BRAVE\nUnit isolates program participants from the negative peer-pressure of the larger prison\nenvironment. Further, the BRAVE Unit must also be solely for BRAVE participants. Inmates living on the unit\nmust be waiting for admission into the program, participating in the program, or have completed\nthe program. Whenever possible, there should be more inmates who are participating in or who\nhave completed BRAVE in the treatment unit than those waiting to enter treatment. 4.1.3. Staffing. The BRAVE Program is staffed with a psychologist who serves as the BRAVE\nProgram Coordinator and a minimum of three BRAVE Program Treatment Specialists. The\nprogram has a 1:20 Treatment Specialist-to-inmate ratio. 4.2. Target Population. The BRAVE Program is designed to address the treatment needs of\ninmates:\n• 32 years of age or younger. • With a sentence of at least 60 months.\n• A first-time Bureau commitment. 4.3. Admission Procedures\n4.3.1. Program Referrals. Inmates are identified for placement in the BRAVE Program by the\nDesignator and/or BRAVE Program Treatment Staff. Designators may directly designate inmates P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 4\nPage 1 to the BRAVE program if they meet the target population criteria. New arrivals to the institution\nmay be screened and accepted into the BRAVE Program if they meet the admission criteria. On occasion, inmates who have poor institutional adjustment may be allowed to participate in the\nBRAVE Program at the Coordinator’s discretion. Inmates who meet all the admission criteria are\nto be given priority placement in the program and should always make up the vast majority of\nprogram participants. 4.3.2. Program Placement. Inmates designated or selected for placement in the BRAVE\nProgram should be placed directly on the BRAVE Program Treatment Unit upon arrival at the\ninstitution. Inmates are strongly encouraged to participate in the program; however, the program\nis voluntary."

Inmates designated or selected for placement in the BRAVE\nProgram should be placed directly on the BRAVE Program Treatment Unit upon arrival at the\ninstitution. Inmates are strongly encouraged to participate in the program; however, the program\nis voluntary. Inmates who agree to participate in the program must sign the Agreement to\nParticipate in Psychology Treatment Programs form (BP-A0940) before they are placed in\nparticipation status. Inmates may decline to participate in the program. Inmates who decline to\nparticipate in the program should be removed from the BRAVE Program Treatment Unit as soon\nas possible. 4.3.3. Enrollment Time Frame. As the BRAVE Program is designed to facilitate a favorable\ninitial adjustment to incarceration, program participants should be assigned to the program at the\nstart of their sentence, upon their first designation to a Bureau institution. 4.4. Assessment of Treatment Needs. A psychosocial assessment of the inmate’s treatment\nneeds is conducted during the Orientation Phase of the program. The information gathered during\nthis face-to-face interview will become a part of the inmate’s treatment plan. This assessment is\navailable on Sallyport. 4.5. Treatment Protocol\n4.5.1. BRAVE Treatment Modules. The BRAVE Program treatment modules direct the\ntreatment program. The program is a six-month, 350-hour program. Ordinarily, programming is\nconducted daily (excluding non-program days, such as weekends and holidays) for half of the\ninmate’s work day. Treatment begins as soon as the inmate is in BRV PART status in SENTRY. The current BRAVE treatment journals and facilitator guides are identified on Sallyport. As evidence-based treatment technologies advance, treatment materials will be revised. Therefore, only the most current BRAVE materials, journals, facilitator guides, etc., are to be\nused. 4.5.2. Treatment Phases. The BRAVE Program is offered in three distinct Phases with each\nphase following a clearly defined structure. The BRAVE Program phases are organized as\nfollows: P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 4\nPage 2 a. Phase I – The Orientation Phase. During the Orientation Phase of treatment, BRAVE\nProgram Treatment Specialists are to perform the following duties related to inmates assigned to\ntheir caseload:\n• Strive to build rapport and motivate the inmate to engage in treatment. • Conduct the psychosocial assessment. This guides the development of the treatment plan. The\ntreatment assessment must be conducted with the inmate. It is not a self-assessment\ninstrument. • Present the inmate’s case at a treatment team meeting. These meetings are scheduled and\nconducted by the BRAVE Program Coordinator. The treatment team meeting is to assist with\nthe development of the inmate’s treatment plan. • Attend treatment team meetings. These meetings provide the opportunity for staff to discuss\neach individual inmate. These discussions are to review the inmate’s progress in treatment and\ncommitment to the program. Phase I will ordinarily last one month. If the treatment team is in agreement that the inmate is not\nready to move on to Phase II, Phase I may be repeated until the inmate is ready to move on,\nwithdraws, or is expelled. b. Phase II – The Core Treatment Phase. In the Core Treatment Phase, the inmate is expected\nto build positive relationships in group, on the treatment unit, with family/significant others, with\ninstitution staff, etc."

In the Core Treatment Phase, the inmate is expected\nto build positive relationships in group, on the treatment unit, with family/significant others, with\ninstitution staff, etc. Using the treatment journals and facilitator guides developed for the program, staff will facilitate\nan environment for inmates to acquire the thought processes and prosocial skills required to live a\ndrug-free, crime-free, and well-managed life. Treatment progress reviews are to be completed every 60 days and are to be documented in PDS. In addition, treatment staff are to observe program participants regularly (e.g., at work, during\nmain line, in the unit) to ascertain if the inmate’s behaviors demonstrated around the treatment\nstaff are constant, or if the inmate’s behavior changes outside of the treatment environment. Ordinarily, the Core Treatment Phase will last four months. Staff should monitor the participants’\nbehaviors, personal insights, motivation, and commitment to treatment daily. Changes in\nbehavior (positive or negative) are to be documented in the participants’ progress reviews. If the treatment team does not believe the inmate has made significant progress at the end of the\ncore treatment phase, staff may require the inmate to repeat all or part of the core treatment phase. Failure to progress in treatment will be documented in the Psychology Data System (PDS). c. Phase III – The Transition Phase. The Transition Phase focuses on the inmate continuing to\npractice the prosocial skills acquired in treatment. In addition, the inmate must demonstrate\nrealistic expectations and living skills to function in a prison environment. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 4\nPage 3 Ordinarily the Transition Phase lasts one month.

The BRAVE Program offers achievement\nawards for inmates who participate appropriately in the program. The BRAVE Program treatment\nteam will determine if an inmate is eligible to receive an achievement award. 4.6.1. Earning Program Achievement Awards. In order to earn program achievement awards,\ninmates must:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Be on time for group. Have no unexcused absences. Not leave group without approval from the Treatment Specialist. Not eat, drink, or sleep in group. Complete all assigned activities. Dress appropriately: clean institutional clothing, shirts tucked in, no jackets or coats, shoes\ntied, no headphones, properly fitting pants with belts, no sunglasses and no head covering\nother than approved religious headgear. • Be active in group.\n• Put forth positive efforts in accomplishing treatment goals, as determined by the treatment\nteam within the treatment plan. • Comply with education and FRP obligations. 4.6.2. Specific Achievement Awards\n• Limited Financial Awards. An inmate may earn a financial award to offset time lost from\nwork. The amount of this award is $40 for each phase of treatment. A financial award may be\npaid in whole or in part, based upon the inmate’s participation and progress. A financial\naward is never to be increased. • Local Incentives."

At that time the BRAVE Coordinator, or designee, is to change the inmate’s SENTRY\nassignment from BRV PART to BRV INCOMP. 4.8. BRAVE Outcomes. How an inmate leaves a Residential program is based on the inmate’s\nbehavior. 4.8.1. Completion. Completion of any Phase of treatment is determined by the inmate’s\nbehavior within the program and on the compound. Inmates are not to be moved from Phase to\nPhase without demonstrating they have:\n• Taken on the responsibilities of the community. • Made a commitment to positive change as evidenced by observed positive behavior in his or\nher daily interactions. • Expressed him or herself in group demonstrating the ability to give and receive appropriate\nfeedback from other staff and inmates. • Mastered phase-related concepts. Inmates who do not demonstrate these, and other, behavioral changes are not ready for\ncompletion. 4.8.2. Withdrawal/Incomplete. An inmate may withdraw voluntarily from the program.

In 1997, Executive Staff approved the implementation of\nResidential Treatment Programs, termed CODE Programs, in the Bureau’s high security\ninstitutions. In 2004, Executive Staff refocused the penitentiary programs with the mission of\nproviding treatment for inmates with drug abuse and/or mental health disorders. Now known as\nthe Challenge Program, the Bureau began a slow conversion of all CODE programs to Challenge\nPrograms. The Challenge Program is a residential, evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral\ntreatment program. 5.1.1. Purpose. The Challenge Program is an intensive Residential Treatment Program for high\nsecurity inmates. It is designed to facilitate both favorable institutional adjustment and successful\nreintegration to the community through the elimination of drug abuse and the\nelimination/management of mental illnesses. The program consists of a core program and two\nspecialized treatment tracks: the drug abuse track and the mental illness track. 5.1.2. Residential Treatment Unit. The Challenge Unit is to be separated from the general\npopulation. Living together in a unit allows all inmates to work together to create a community\nthat supports prosocial attitudes and behaviors. The Challenge Unit isolates program participants\nfrom the negative peer pressure of the larger prison environment. Further, the Challenge Unit\nmust be solely for Challenge participants. Inmates living on the unit must be: waiting for\nadmission into the program (CHG WAIT); participating in the program (CHG PART); or\nChallenge complete (CHG COMP). Whenever possible, there should be more inmates who are\nparticipating in or who have completed Challenge in the treatment unit than those waiting to enter\ntreatment. 5.1.3. Staffing. The Challenge Program is staffed by a psychologist who serves as the Challenge\nProgram Coordinator and a minimum of three Challenge Program Treatment Specialists. The\nprogram has a 1:20 Treatment Specialist-to-inmate ratio. 5.2. Target Population. An inmate must meet one of the following criteria to be admitted into\nthe Challenge Program:\n• A history of drug abuse as evidenced by self-report, Presentence Investigation Report (PSR)\ndocumentation, or incident reports for use of alcohol or drugs. • A major mental illness as evidenced by a current diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, mood\ndisorder, anxiety disorder, or personality disorder. 5.3. Admission Procedures\n5.3.1. Program Placement. Inmates are identified for placement in the program by the\nChallenge Program Coordinator or designee. There are a variety of potential indicators for\nprogram placement. These indicators must include at least one of the following: a CMA\nP5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 5\nPage 1 assignment of PSY ALERT, an MDS assignment of MEN ILL, a Sensitive Medical Data (SMD)\nassignment of MNTL HLTH, apparent symptoms of a major mental illness, recent placement on\nSuicide Watch, the need for detoxification upon entrance into Bureau custody, a DRG I REQ or\nDAP WAIT assignment, the receipt of an incident report for use of alcohol or drugs, or a history\nof substance abuse noted in the inmate’s PSR."

Inmates may self-refer for the program, provided they meet the\nadmission criteria. To request placement in the Challenge program, inmates must submit an\nInmate Request to Staff form (BP-A0148) to the Challenge Coordinator. The Challenge\nCoordinator will determine the appropriateness of the inmate’s placement in the program. A\nwaiting list of inmates approved for voluntary placement in the program will be maintained in\nSENTRY. The inmate will sign the Agreement to Participate in Psychology Treatment Programs\nform (BP-A0940) when he is notified of his acceptance to the program. 5.3.3. Enrollment Time Frame. The Challenge Program is designed to facilitate both a\nfavorable adjustment to incarceration and a successful release to the community. Participants\nmay enroll in the program at any time during the course of their sentence, provided they have\nsufficient time to complete the program. Priority placement should be given to inmates at the\nbeginning of their sentence in order to maximize the program’s impact on the inmate’s behavior\nwhile incarcerated. 5.4. Assessment of Need. A psychosocial assessment of the inmate’s treatment needs is\nconducted during the Orientation Phase of the program. The information gathered during this\nface-to-face interview will become a part of the case conceptualization for the treatment plan. This assessment format is available in the Psychology Data System (PDS). Other assessments or\ntesting will be conducted as needed, based on the inmate’s behaviors. 5.5. Treatment Protocol\n5.5.1. Treatment Modules. The Challenge Program treatment modules direct the treatment\nprogram. In the Drug Abuse Track, programming is 500 contact hours; i.e., face-to-face contact\nbetween treatment staff and inmate participants, over no less than 9 months of half-day\nprogramming. Ordinarily, programming is conducted daily (excluding non-program days, such as\nweekends and holidays) for half of the inmate’s work day. In the Mental Illness Track,\nprogramming is based on a clinical case management model, with contact hours based on need. Treatment begins as soon as the inmate is in CHG PART status in SENTRY. The developed Challenge Treatment journals, facilitator guides, and manuals are required for the\nChallenge Program. The current treatment journals and facilitator guides are identified on\nSallyport. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 5\nPage 2 As evidence-based treatment technologies advance, treatment materials will be revised. Therefore, only the most current Challenge materials, journals, facilitator guides, etc., are to be\nused. 5.5.2. Treatment Phases. The Challenge Program is organized in Phases. Each Phase follows a\nclearly defined structure. The Phases are organized as follows:\na. Phase I – The Orientation Phase. During the Orientation Phase of treatment, Challenge\nProgram Treatment Specialists are to perform the following duties related to inmates assigned to\ntheir caseload:\n• Strive to build rapport and motivate the inmate to engage in treatment. • Conduct the psychosocial assessment. This guides the development of the treatment plan. The treatment assessment must be conducted with the inmate. It is not a self-assessment\ninstrument. • Present the inmate’s case at a treatment team meeting. These meetings are scheduled and\nconducted by the Challenge Program Coordinator."

It is not a self-assessment\ninstrument. • Present the inmate’s case at a treatment team meeting. These meetings are scheduled and\nconducted by the Challenge Program Coordinator. The treatment team meeting is to assist\nwith the development of the inmate’s treatment plan. • Attend treatment team meetings. These meetings provide the opportunity for staff to discuss\neach individual inmate. These discussions are to review the inmate’s progress in treatment\nand commitment to the program. Phase I will ordinarily last one month. If the treatment team is in agreement that the inmate is not\nready to move on to Phase II, Phase I may be repeated until the inmate is ready to move on,\nwithdraws, or is expelled. b. Phase II – The Core Treatment Phase. In the Core Treatment Phase, the inmate is expected\nto build positive relationships in group, on the treatment unit, with family/significant others, with\ninstitution staff, etc. Using the treatment journals and facilitator guides developed for the program, staff will facilitate\nan environment for inmates to acquire the thought processes and prosocial skills required to live a\ndrug-free, crime-free, and well-managed life. Treatment progress reviews are to be completed every 60 days and are to be documented in PDS. In addition, treatment staff are to observe program participants regularly (e.g., at work, during\nmain line, in the unit) to ascertain if the inmate’s behaviors demonstrated around the treatment\nstaff are constant, or if the inmate’s behavior changes outside of the treatment environment. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 5\nPage 3 Ordinarily, the core treatment phase will last six months. Staff should monitor the participants’\nbehaviors, personal insights, motivation, and commitment to treatment daily. Changes in\nbehavior (positive or negative) are to be documented in the participants’ progress reviews. If the treatment team does not believe the inmate has made significant progress at the end of the\ncore treatment phase, staff may require the inmate to repeat all or part of the Core Treatment\nPhase. Failure to progress in treatment will be documented in PDS. c. Phase III – The Transition Phase. The Transition Phase focuses on the inmate continuing to\npractice the prosocial skills acquired in treatment. In addition, the inmate must demonstrate\nrealistic expectations and living skills to function in a prison environment. Ordinarily the Transition Phase lasts two months. If the treatment team finds the inmate has not\nmade adequate progress, he may be held back until he or she completes, withdraws, or is expelled\nfrom the program. 5.6. Challenge Program Achievement Awards. The Challenge Program offers achievement\nawards for inmates who participate appropriately in the program. The Challenge Program\ntreatment team will determine if an inmate is eligible to receive an achievement award. 5.6.1. Earning Program Achievement Awards. In order to earn program achievement awards,\ninmates must:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Be on time for group. Have no unexcused absences. Not leave group without approval from the Treatment Specialist. Not eat, drink, or sleep in group. Complete all assigned activities."

Inmates who do not demonstrate these and other behavioral changes are not ready for Challenge\ncompletion. 5.8.2. Withdrawal/Incomplete. An inmate may withdraw voluntarily from the program. Withdrawals must be documented in PDS and a memorandum forwarded to the Unit Team. An inmate may also be moved to Incomplete status for many reasons: placement in the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU), removed from the institution on a writ, unforseen redesignation, etc. An\nincomplete does not mean the inmate is automatically a failure. The Treatment Coordinator and\nthe treatment team will make the decision on the inmate’s final treatment determination,\ndepending on the reason for his or her incomplete status. The Treatment Coordinator will ensure\nproper documentation of the meeting in PDS and SENTRY. 5.8.3. Expulsion. Inmates may be removed from the program by the coordinator because of\ndisruptive behavior related to the program or unsatisfactory progress in treatment. Ordinarily,\nstaff will provide the inmate with at least one treatment intervention prior to removal. In response\nto disruptive behavior or unsatisfactory progress, treatment staff will:\n• Meet with the inmate to discuss his or her behavior or lack of progress. • Assign the treatment intervention(s) chosen to reduce or eliminate the behavior, or to improve\nprogress. • Warn the inmate of the consequences of failure to alter his/her behavior. • Properly document in PDS the meeting and treatment intervention(s) assigned. • Properly document in PDS changes to the inmate’s treatment plan, and ensure that both staff\nand the inmate sign the amended treatment plan. • When appropriate, require the inmate to discuss his or her targeted behavior in the community. In the event repeated treatment interventions are required in response to inappropriate behaviors\nor unsatisfactory progress, the treatment team will meet to decide if the inmate will be removed\nfrom the program.

Mental Health Treatment Programs are a series\nof programs dedicated to management and treatment of the Bureau’s seriously mentally ill and\nbehaviorally disordered inmates. Current Mental Health Treatment Programs include:\n•\n•\n•\n• The Habilitation Program. The Skills Program. The Axis II Program. Mental Health Treatment Units (e.g., Step-Down Units). Additional Mental Health Treatment Programs may be implemented by Central Office. Each Mental Health Treatment Program Coordinator is responsible for preparation of an\nInstitution Supplement that provides specific details regarding the operation of their program. As\nevidence-based treatment technologies advance, Coordinators will be responsible for inclusion of\nthese technologies in their programs and their Institution Supplement. Central Office will serve as\na resource in this process. 6.1.1. Purpose. Mental Health Treatment Programs are designed to effectively manage and treat\nthe Bureau’s seriously mentally ill and behaviorally disordered inmates. Specifically, the\nprograms are designed to reduce psychological symptoms, improve functioning, facilitate\ninstitutional adjustment, and reduce incidents of misconduct. 6.1.2. Residential Treatment Unit. Mental Health Treatment Program participants are to be\nhoused together on a unit, separate from general population inmates. Living together in a unit\nallows all inmates to work together to create a community that supports prosocial attitudes and\nbehaviors. The treatment unit isolates program participants from the negative peer pressure of the\nlarger prison environment. In addition, the treatment unit offers mentally ill inmates an\nenvironment where they are less likely to be victimized by other inmates. The Mental Health Treatment Program unit must be solely for program participants. Inmates\nliving on the unit must be waiting for admission into the program, participating in the program, or\nprogram completers. Whenever possible, there should be more inmates who are participating and\nhave completed the treatment program in the treatment unit than those waiting to enter treatment. 6.1.3. Staffing."

Whenever possible, there should be more inmates who are participating and\nhave completed the treatment program in the treatment unit than those waiting to enter treatment. 6.1.3. Staffing. Mental Health Treatment Programs are staffed by a psychologist who serves as\nthe Program Coordinator. Additional program staff may include psychologists, Treatment\nSpecialists, social workers, teachers, and psychiatrists, depending on the needs of the individual\nprograms. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 6\nPage 1 Staffing complements for Mental Health Treatment Programs are established by Executive Staff\nat the time of program implementation. The staffing complements for current programs are listed\nbelow:\n• The Habilitation Program has a capacity of 16 inmates and is staffed by a psychologist. • The Skills Program has a capacity of 44 inmates and is staffed by a psychologist, a Treatment\nSpecialist, and a teacher. • The Axis II Program has a capacity of 48 inmates and is staffed by a psychologist, two\nTreatment Specialists, and a correctional counselor. • The female Step-Down Unit has a capacity of 72 and is staffed by a psychologist. • The male Step-Down Unit has a capacity of 84 and is staffed by a psychologist, a social\nworker, and a half-time psychologist. Any changes to these staffing complements require Central Office approval. 6.2. Target Population. An inmate must meet all the following criteria to be admitted into a\nMental Health Treatment Program:\n• The inmate must have a serious mental illness or behavioral disorder, including psychotic\ndisorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, or significant cognitive\nimpairment.\n• The inmate has a need for intensive treatment services, as evidenced by:\n�\n�\n�\n� Multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. Complex psychotropic treatment. Major mental health-related functional impairment. Repeated instances of severe behavioral problems. Note: In some instances a mentally ill inmate may be placed in a residential mental health\ntreatment program for management reasons. In these instances an Agreement to Participate is not\nrequired. However, in these instances an inmate must be informed of program expectations. Prior\nto participation in any treatment group the Agreement to Participate in Psychology Treatment\nPrograms form (BP-A0940) must be signed. The target populations for current Mental Health Treatment Programs are noted below:\n6.2.1. The Habilitation Program. The Habilitation Program targets high security, low\nfunctioning inmates who cannot successfully adapt to a penitentiary environment, but who may\nhave the ability to function well at medium security level institutions. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 6\nPage 2 6.2.2. The Skills Program. The Skills Program is designed for inmates with significant\ncognitive limitations and psychological difficulties that create adaptive problems in prison and in\nthe community. 6.2.3. The Axis II Program. The Axis II Program targets inmates with severe personality\ndisorders, typically Borderline Personality Disorder, who have a history of behavioral problems in\nthe institution and who are amenable to treatment. 6.2.4. Mental Health Treatment Units. Mental Health Treatment Units, including Step-Down\nUnits, provide an intermediate level of mental health care for seriously mentally ill inmates."

Mental Health Treatment Units, including Step-Down\nUnits, provide an intermediate level of mental health care for seriously mentally ill inmates. Typically Mental Health Treatment Units are located in Care Level 3 institutions. Step-Down Units provide intensive treatment for inmates releasing from psychiatric hospitalization and may\nalso function as Step-Up Units to intervene before an inmate requires hospitalization. Note: Mental Health Treatment Program Step-Down Units are not to be confused with custodial\nStep-Down Units. 6.3. Admission Procedures. Inmates are identified for placement in Mental Health Treatment\nPrograms by the Program Coordinators. In addition, Chief Psychologists throughout the Bureau\nmay refer seriously mentally ill inmates to Mental Health Treatment Programs, provided they\nmeet the program admission criteria. The Program Coordinator is responsible for screening these\nreferrals and making recommendations regarding the inmates’ appropriateness for the program. Each program’s Institution Supplement will include a description of the program’s specific\nadmission procedures. 6.4. Assessment of Treatment Needs. At a minimum, a psychosocial assessment of the inmate’s\ntreatment needs is conducted during the Orientation Phase of the program. The information\ngathered during this face-to-face interview will become part of the inmate’s treatment plan. The\nassessment may also include other evaluation measures specific to the needs of the program and\nthe individual inmate. Each program’s Institution Supplement will include a description of the program’s specific\nassessment procedures. 6.5. Treatment Protocol. Treatment protocols for the Mental Health Treatment Programs will\nvary, based on the focus of the individual programs. However, all treatment protocols will utilize\nevidence-based interventions, with an emphasis on cognitive and behavioral treatment strategies. At a minimum, these interventions will include: psycho-educational courses related to mental\nillness and its management, skills training groups, and clinical case management. As evidencebased treatment technologies advance, treatment materials will be revised. Therefore, only the\nmost current Mental Health materials are to be used. Central Office staff will provide guidance\nregarding appropriate treatment protocols. P5330.11 3/16/2009\nFederal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type Chapter 6\nPage 3 Mental Health Treatment Programs are intensive treatment interventions, with most participants\nremaining active in the program for at least six months. Treatment staff are responsible for\nactively treating and managing program participants on a daily basis. Each program’s Institution\nSupplement will include a description of the program’s specific treatment protocol. 6.6. Program Achievement Awards. Although used with less frequency than in other\npsychology treatment programs, Mental Health Treatment Programs may make use of program\nachievement awards. Any program achievement awards must be approved by the Warden and the\nRegional Psychology Services Administrator. For example:\n• Local Incentives. Institutions may offer incentives such as preferred living quarters, early\nmainline, exercise equipment on the unit, a program library, a movie night, etc.\n• Tangible Incentives. With the Warden’s approval, tangible incentives (e.g., books, t-shirts,\nnotebooks, mugs with program logo) may be offered. • Graduation Ceremony/Ritual. For the completion of the Mental Health Treatment\nPrograms, institution staff may offer a structured completion/graduation ceremony for the\ninmates. Photographs of individual participants or the treatment group may be allowed. Inmates may mail a photograph of themselves or the group to family."
