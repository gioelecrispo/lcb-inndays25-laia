Federal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from\nthe COPS Office must be monitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable\nstatutory regulations. The COPS Office is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the\nadvancement of community policing. Both aspects of award implementation—compliance and programmatic\nbenefits—are part of the monitoring process coordinated by the US Department of Justice. Award monitoring\nactivities conducted by the COPS Office include site visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance\nreviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and audit resolution. As a COPS Office award recipient, you agree\nto cooperate with and respond to any requests for information pertaining to your award. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain a\nmonitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are adhering to COPS Office award\nrequirements and develops the best technical assistance based on this feedback. In addition, the monitoring\ncomponent provides customer service and technical assistance to help ensure recipients understand how to\nremain in compliance while implementing their awards. 12 2017 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and nonroutine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency’s use of federal funds, both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients’ compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to\nconduct site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is\nthree-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare\nfor the review of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period of one or\nmore days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while onsite, or if necessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an opportunity to seek\ncustomer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an\nEOBGR conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an\nalternative for conducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office’s overall award\nmonitoring strategy. The purpose of the EOBGR is three-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period."
