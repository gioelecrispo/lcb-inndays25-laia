The purpose\nis to protect the public interest and to ensure proper management in federal activities by conducting business with\nresponsible parties. 30 2019 COPS Office Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act (LEMHWA) Program Award Owner’s Manual What you should do: If the total value of your active grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts from all federal awarding agencies\nexceeds $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period, then you must ensure that the proceedings described\nin paragraph 2 of this award term that are reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) are current.

Computer Network Requirement\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees that no award funds may be used to maintain or establish a computer\nnetwork unless such network blocks the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. Nothing in this\nrequirement limits the use of funds necessary for any federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any\nother entity carrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2019, Public Law 116-6, Division C, Title V, Section 523. Why this condition:\nSection 523 of Division C, Title V, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (Pub.

This provision protects the public interest in the proper management and use of\nfederal funds. What you should do: The recipient must not use award funds to maintain or establish a computer network unless the network blocks\npornography. This does not limit the use of funds for criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. 26.
