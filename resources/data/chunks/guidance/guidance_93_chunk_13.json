  "chunk_text": "The four primary means of ensuring recipients’ compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to\nconduct site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is\nthreefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award ii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies iii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare for\nthe review of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period of one or more days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while on-site or, if\nnecessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer\nservice and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an\nEOBGR conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an\nalternative for conducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office’s overall award\nmonitoring strategy. The purpose of the EOBGR is threefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award ii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies iii. To provide customer service and technical assistance 12 If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve\nany identified noncompliance issues, if necessary, following the EOBGR interview. In addition, award\nrecipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many\nsources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office\nFinance Division, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a\nnoncompliance issue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous\ncomplainants, media, citizens, law enforcement agencies, other Federal agencies, or other outside\nsources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of\naction to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter\ncontact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the OIG. Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or\nnonviolation based upon the preponderance of the supporting documentation or other facts to determine\nif the award recipient is in compliance or noncompliance. Audit liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award."
