  "chunk_text": "• Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. • Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency’s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your SVPP award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your SVPP award (including payroll, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, and purchase orders) must be retained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 C.F.R §C.F.R. § 200.333 (Retention requirements\nfor records). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever you\nfind more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving these records has been\nstarted before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These\nrecords should be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to\nmaintain adequate records to document award expenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds\nthat cannot be supported with appropriate records. 43 2018 COPS Office STOP School Violence: School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner’s Manual What if we have more than one award?

Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Comptroller\nGeneral of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may access these\nrecords for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 44 2018 COPS Office STOP School Violence: School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner’s Manual V.
