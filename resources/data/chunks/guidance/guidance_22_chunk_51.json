Procurement Process In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition when feasible. For\nthe purchase of equipment, technology, or services under a COPS Office award, recipients must follow their own\npolicies and procedures on procurement as long as those requirements conform to the federal procurement\nrequirements set forth in 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.317 – 200.326. As described in the award condition titled “Sole Source Justification”, recipients are required to submit a sole\nsource justification (SSJ) request to the COPS Office for noncompetitive procurements in excess of $250,000 prior\nto purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract; or entering into a contract\nwith award funds. If submitting a sole source justification request to the COPS Office, please use the format\ndescribed in the “Sole Source Justification fact sheet” in the appendices of this manual. If you have any questions regarding the federal requirements that guide procurement procedures, please contact\nyour COPS Office Program Manager.

For assistance with financial management and award\nadministration, please contact the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one payment system available for accessing federal award funds—the Grant Payment Request\nSystem (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables recipients to use a secure Internet connection to request\nfunds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States Department\nof the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the primary system\nthat agencies use for EFT. An award recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made since July\n2009. For more information regarding GPRS, please visit the following website:\nhttps://ojp.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm. Setting up your account How do we set up a new GPRS account?"
