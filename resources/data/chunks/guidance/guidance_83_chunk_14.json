In addition,\nrecipients will have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an EOBGR\nconducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative for\nconducting site visit reviews in support of the COPS Office’s overall award monitoring strategy. The purpose of\nthe EOBGR is three-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Compliance reviews will be conducted for\nactive awards to address any noncompliance and/or administrative issues identified during the review. In\naddition, award recipients will receive customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a noncompliance\nissue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media,\ncitizens, law enforcement agencies, other federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case basis,\nCOPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints\nof alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the\nOffice of the Inspector General (OIG). Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or non-violation based upon\nthe supporting documentation and/or other factors used to make a determination for compliance or noncompliance. 12 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\n4. Audit Liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event\nyour agency is audited by the OIG and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance and/or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with your\nagency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may include\nrepayment of award funds and/or providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance and/or\nproviding proof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the causes for the\nnoncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO)."
