Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted from a\nviolation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, award terms and conditions, or other\ndocument governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable and do not\nreflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because costs at the time\nof the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. • Policy and procedure. Weaknesses are identified in a recipient’s accounting practices, fiscal stewardship,\naccuracy of data used in the development of the award applications, and/or inventory controls that led to the\nrecommendation cited in the audit.

Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report COPS\nOffice award funding separately from all other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal awards) to\nensure accurate financial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have\nadequate financial internal controls in place to monitor the use of all funding, and also to ensure that its use is\nconsistent with the award terms and conditions.
