As such, the following contacts are provided to address noncompliance and technical assistance\nissues:\n• If you suspect violations of a criminal nature, please contact the US Department of Justice, Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) at www.oig.justice.gov/hotline, OIG.hotline@usdoj.gov, or 800-869-4499.\n• If you suspect award violations (not criminal in nature) related to the award conditions listed in this manual,\nplease contact the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division at 202-514-9202.\n• If you have any questions or need assistance regarding your award, please contact your COPS Office Program\nManager via the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. 62 VIII. When the Award Period Has Ended At the end of your organization’s CRI-TA award period, the COPS Office is responsible for the closeout of your\naward. As part of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation demonstrating that your organization has\nmet all of the programmatic and financial requirements of the award. After the end of the award period, your organization will be asked to submit a Final Federal Financial Report (SF425) and any applicable final programmatic progress reports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) for your award is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after the\nend date of the award period. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal expenditures\nthat were incurred during the life of the award, as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. The\nfederal funds expended should reflect only the actual allowable costs incurred relative to the specific program\nrequirements for that award. In addition, once you have completed your final drawdown, this report should\nreconcile with the total amount of federal funds drawn down by your organization. The final SF-425 should also\ninclude the required minimum total amount of local (recipient) cash match contributed, if applicable. When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your organization has incurred but\nnot yet paid. Your organization has up to 90 days after the end of the award period to request reimbursement for\neligible funds obligated. Please be advised that 2 CFR § 200.343(a) requires recipients to submit final SF-425s and 2 CFR § 200.343(b)\nrequires recipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of\nthe award. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your organization may have unobligated and unspent award funds remaining in your account\nfollowing the award period due to an overestimate of item costs during the application period."
