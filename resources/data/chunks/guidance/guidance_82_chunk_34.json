The U.S. Department of\nJustice reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise\nuse the work for Federal Government purposes and to authorize others to do so. This resource may be\nfreely distributed and used for noncommercial and educational purposes only.” Why this condition:\nU.S. Department of Justice regulations allow the recipient of a SVPP award to copyright any work that is subject to\ncopyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under an award. As a Federal Government agency whose activities include producing and disseminating law enforcement materials\nto advance public safety across the nation, the COPS Office has an interest in making your deliverables and\nproducts widely available and accessible to the public. The COPS Office may make any work that was developed or\npurchased under this award publically available by any means without restriction, including a U.S. Department of\nJustice website, social media account, a hard copy, or in electronic form. The COPS Office also reserves the right, at\nits discretion, to not publish deliverables and other materials (e.g., reports, publications, manuals, and training\ncurricula) developed under this award as a U.S. Department of Justice resource. What you should do: The recipient is responsible for acquiring the rights, and ensuring that its subrecipients/contractors/authors\nacquire the rights, including the payment of required fees, to use copyrighted material for inclusion in deliverables\nthat are developed under this award. All licensing, publishing, or similar agreements with a copyright holder,\npublisher, or other relevant party must include provisions giving the COPS Office a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and\nirrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work in whole or in part (including create derivative\nworks) for Federal Government purposes and to authorize others to do so. If the recipient retains a contractor or\nconsultant to author or coauthor a work under this award, the recipient must ensure that there is a written\nagreement with the contractor or consultant that explicitly (1) assigns and transfers all rights to the copyright in\nthe work to the recipient for the full term of copyright and, if a copyright transfer is not feasible, (2) awards the\nCOPS Office the same royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to use, and authorize others to use, the\nwork for Federal Government purposes. The U.S. Department of Justice is a nonexclusive licensee to copyrighted work that was developed, or for which\nownership was purchased, under this award. Only the legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under a\ncopyright is entitled to institute an infringement action. The recipient should therefore consult its own legal\ncounsel with any copyright infringement questions.
