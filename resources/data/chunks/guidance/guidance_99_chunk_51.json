Because lockup facilities are not required to\ncollect information on characteristics not listed in Standard 115.141, the facility may not have an official record of detainees\nwho present these other risk factors; however, the auditor may be able to identify these detainees through interviews with\nother detainees and staff, and review of detainee records (e.g., medical or mental health records). 51 TABLE 3: REQUIRED NUMBER OF RESIDENT INTERVIEWS Community Confinement Facilities\nInterview Type 0–50\nAt least 10 51–100\nAt least 16 Overall Minimum Number of\nResident Interviews\nMinimum Number of Random At least 5 At least 8\nResident Interviews\nMinimum Number of Targeted At least 5 At least 8\nResident Interviews\nBreakdown of Required Targeted Resident Interviews At least 1 At least 1\nResidents with a Physical\nDisability Resident Population Size*\n101–250\n251–500 At least 20\nAt least 26\nAt least 10 At least 13 At least 15 At least 10 At least 13 At least 15 At least 1 At least 1 At least 1 Residents who are Blind, Deaf,\nor Hard of Hearing\nResidents who are LEP At least 1\nResidents with a Cognitive\nAt least 1 At least 1\nAt least 1\nDisability\nAt least 1 At least 1 At least 2 At least 2\nResidents who Identify as\nLesbian, Gay, or Bisexual\nAt least 1 At least 2 At least 3"
