What you should do:\nRefer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable cost categories (please see appendix K on page 129 for a\nsample FCM). Listed below are the budget categories that may appear on your FCM. If your agency’s operating\nbudget categories differ from those approved in the FCM, your agency should maintain a cross-reference to clearly\nidentify where the funds were budgeted. As long as funds are spent during the award period on project costs that\nwere documented in your application’s budget summary and approved by the COPS Office through the issuance of\nthe FCM, this award condition will be satisfied. The award number should be indicated on all budgetary\ndocumentation including purchase orders, receipts, and other documentation. All recipients should keep and\nmaintain the most recent, approved version of their 2019 CPD application and FCM for future reference. For\nrecipients that are state, local, or Tribal Government entities, requests may be made only for items or positions\nthat are not otherwise budgeted with state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds and would not be funded\nin the absence of the CPD award. 5 2019 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual\nPersonnel (salaries and benefits) Personnel expenses may be reimbursed for project activities that take place on or after the award start date. In\naddition, a position’s salary must be reasonable for the services rendered and must be paid to a person appointed\nunder the law or rules governing hiring by your agency. Salary payments must be based on payroll records. Time\nand attendance records or the equivalent must support payroll records. With respect to any CPD award, a recipient\nmay not use federal funds to pay total cash compensation to any employee of the recipient at a rate that exceeds\n110 percent of the maximum annual salary payable to a member of the Federal Government’s Senior Executive\nService (SES) at an agency with a Certified SES Performance Appraisal System for that year. The 2019 salary table\nfor SES employees is available at the Office of Personnel Management website: https://www.opm.gov/policydata-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2019/executive-senior-level. For recipients that are state, local, or\ntribal government entities, award-funded salary and benefit costs must supplement, not supplant (replace), locally\nfunded personnel costs that would have been funded even in the absence of this award. If any civilian personnel\nare employed on a part-time or temporary basis, your agency must specify the percentage of time that each\nperson is working solely on the project identified in your agency’s CPD proposal. Fringe benefits may be paid if\nthey are part of a reasonable compensation package offered to your employees. Particular items of fringe benefits\nmust fall within the categories authorized by the COPS Office.
