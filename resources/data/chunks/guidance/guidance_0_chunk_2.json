  "chunk_text": "The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 protects people who are 40 or older\nfrom discrimination because of age. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 prohibits discrimination based\non genetic information (which includes family medical history). The Immigration and Nationality Act’s Anti-Discrimination Provision prohibits\ndiscrimination based on citizenship, immigration status, and national origin (for certain\nemployers not covered under Title VII). Executive Order 11246 prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from\ndiscriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender\nidentity, or national origin and requires affirmative action to promote equal\nopportunity. Contractors also are prohibited from discriminating against applicants or\nemployees because they inquire about, discuss, or disclose their compensation or that\nof others, subject to certain limitations. Employers are also prohibited from retaliating against you, for example threatening to withhold\na promotion or firing you, for asserting your rights under these laws or otherwise participating\nin protected activity. Examples of protected activity include filing a complaint or participating\nin an investigation. Do You Qualify for USERRA’s Reemployment Rights? To qualify for USERRA’s reemployment rights, you must be a service member and generally\nmeet the following eligibility criteria:\n•\n•\n•\n• You must have left a civilian job to perform covered service; You must have given notice to the employer that you were leaving to perform military\nservice (orally or in writing); You have had five years or less of cumulative service with the covered employer\n(although there are a number of exceptions to this rule); You must not have a disqualifying discharge (dishonorable, other than honorable, or bad\nconduct); and\n2 • You must have reported back to work within the appropriate time constraints (which\nare dependent on the time spent on covered military service). More information on who qualifies for USERRA protections can be found on the VETS and CRT\nwebpages. How Do You Assert Your Rights Under USERRA? You can seek assistance for enforcing your rights under USERRA with the federal government,\nor by filing a lawsuit directly in court with your own lawyer. VETS investigates and resolves complaints of USERRA violations. For assistance in filing a\ncomplaint, or for other information on USERRA, visit the VETS website. Use an interactive\nonline USERRA Advisor. If you file a complaint with VETS and the agency is unable to resolve the matter to your\nsatisfaction, you may request that your case be referred to the Department of Justice or the\nOffice of Special Counsel, as applicable, for representation. CRT has authority to bring lawsuits against private, state, and local government employers for\nviolations of USERRA but only upon receiving complaint referrals from VETS. If CRT lawyers are\nreasonably satisfied that the service member is entitled to relief after receiving a referral, CRT\nmay commence an action in federal court. Please note that CRT may not be able to bring a lawsuit in every case that is referred to it but\nreviews every referral carefully. For more information, please see the Department of Justice’s\nServicemembers and Veterans Initiative webpage. Do You Qualify as a “Protected Veteran” Under VEVRAA?"
