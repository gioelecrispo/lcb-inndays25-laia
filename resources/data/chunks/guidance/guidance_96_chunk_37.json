Accessing Award Funds This section provides answers to payment-related questions, including all the information needed to set up your\npayments. For assistance with financial management and award administration, please contact the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one payment system available for accessing federal award funds—the Grant Payment Request\nSystem (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables recipients to use a secure Internet connection to request\nfunds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States Department\nof the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the primary system\nthat agencies use for EFT. An award recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made since July\n2009. For more information regarding GPRS, please visit the following website to view the GPRS User Guide\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm. Setting up your account How do we set up a GPRS account? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s) will be\nresponsible for requesting federal funds from your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The individual(s)\nselected must click on the following link and register with the GPRS system to become a drawdown specialist for\nyour agency: https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome. Once you have been approved, you will receive an email containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement\nexecutive and/or government executive or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process. All individuals who need access to GPRS must register separately and\ncreate their own unique GPRS username account, as these accounts are not meant to be shared. How do we add an award to an existing GPRS account? If you are currently registered for an active COPS Office award username in GPRS and would like to add a recently\nawarded COPS Office award to your existing COPS Office award username, contact the COPS Office GPRS\nregistration team via email at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information:\n•\n•\n•\n• User name (for COPS Office awards) First/last name\nVendor number (as listed on your award document)\nAward number(s) to be added 36"
