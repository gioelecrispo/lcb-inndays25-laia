  "chunk_text": "The Deputy Attorney General recently issued\nGuidance Regarding Threats Against Election Workers. 6 | Federal Law Constraints on Post-Election “Audits” U.S. Department of Justice There have been reports, with respect to some of the post-2020 ballot examinations, of proposals to\ncontact individuals face to face to see whether the individuals were qualiﬁed voters who had\nactually voted. See, e.g., Cyber Ninjas Statement of Work ¶ 5.1 (proposing to select three precincts\nin a large urban county to collect information from individuals through “a combination of phone calls\nand physical canvassing”). This sort of activity raises concerns regarding potential intimidation of voters. For example, when\nsuch investigative efforts are directed, or are perceived to be directed, at minority voters or minority\ncommunities, they can have a signiﬁcant intimidating effect on qualiﬁed voters that can deter them\nfrom seeking to vote in the future. Jurisdictions that authorize or conduct audits must ensure that\nthe way those reviews are conducted has neither the purpose nor the effect of dissuading qualiﬁed\ncitizens from participating in the electoral process. If they do not, the Department will act to ensure\nthat all eligible citizens feel safe in exercising their right to register and cast a ballot in future\nelections. If jurisdictions have questions about the constraints federal law places on the kinds of post-election\naudits they can conduct, they should contact the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division. If\ncitizens believe a jurisdiction has violated the Civil Rights Act’s election record retention and\npreservation requirements, or believe they have been subjected to intimidation, they can use the\nCivil Rights Division's online complaint form to report their concerns or call (800) 253-3931. 7 | Federal Law Constraints on Post-Election “Audits”"
