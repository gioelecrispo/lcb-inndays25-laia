  "chunk_text": "Therefore, the recipient must use the CAMP award funding to benefit its own service population. What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the CAMP award cannot provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies unless\nthey will directly benefit the recipient’s jurisdiction. For example, a sheriff’s department cannot use a CAMPfunded officer to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but can use the CAMPfunded officer to provide direct law enforcement services to towns within its own county. 28. Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using CAMP funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. By signing the Certification of Review and Representation of Compliance\nwith Requirements in the application, the recipient assured the COPS Office that it will comply with the\nrequirements of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an inter-jurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found in 28 C.F.R. Part 23. An interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system that receives, stores, analyzes, and\nexchanges or disseminates data regarding on-going pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence systems which protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use CAMP award funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms of\ntechnology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not apply\nto this award. What you should do:\nAll CAMP recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence Systems/28 C.F.R. Part 23 as part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to use their award\nfunds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use award funds to\noperate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should have indicated this in your application and\ncertified your agency’s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Your agency\nnow must comply with 28 C.F.R. Part 23 in operating the inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system funded\nthrough your CAMP award. 33 2019 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual 29. Sole Source Justification\nCondition:\nRecipients who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group of items) or service in excess\nof $250,000 and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement process must provide a\nwritten sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating, expending, or drawing down\naward funds for that item or service. 2 C.F.R. § 200.324(b)(2). Why this condition: In general, the recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in\nsome instances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do:"
