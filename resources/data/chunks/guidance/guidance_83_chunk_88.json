Community Policing Defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of\npartnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to\npublic safety issues such as violent crime, nonviolent crime, and fear of crime. Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1.\nCommunity partnerships\n2. Organizational transformation 3. Problem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the individuals\nand organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages interactive\npartnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these partnerships can be\nused to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through collaborative problem\nsolving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and addressing public safety\nproblems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify community\nconcerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies, prosecutors, probation\nand parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies, health and human\nservices departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community—volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters—are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific goals at\ntown hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the community,\nand team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its behalf\ncan be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share common\ninterests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups, advocacy\ngroups, community development corporations, and the faith community. 92 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Institutions of Higher Education\nInstitutions of higher education create communities of students, professors, and personnel that are important\nstakeholders. The institutions can also provide resources to law enforcement agencies by assisting with\ncommunication strategies, facilitation of community meetings, data analysis, and research. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because they\noften bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify\nproblems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and community\noutreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating information about\npolice and business partnerships and initiatives, and crime prevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community agencies\nor new laws or codes that will be enforced."
