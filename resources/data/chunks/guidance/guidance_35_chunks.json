As discussed in more detail below,\nrecipients and others are to refer to the version of each list that applied at the time of an actual\nor proposed obligation (“use”) of (federal) Byrne JAG award funds, as well as the conditions in\nthe particular Byrne JAG award. Archival information that includes prior versions of both lists\n(which are incorporated by reference herein) may be accessed at\nhttps://www.bja.gov/Jag/pdfs/JAGControlledExpendituresArchive.pdf.  Pertinent dates — “use of federal funds,” “purchase under the award,” and related\nmatters.
