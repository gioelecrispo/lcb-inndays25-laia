  "chunk_text": "enter the total amount of program income earned ($5,000)\non 10.l and the total amount of program income expended\non line 10.m. 4 Program income earned and expended must be reported on\na cumulative basis. You must manually enter these\ncumulative amounts each quarter, as the SF-425 form does\nnot automatically calculate these amounts. For example, if\n$5,000 in program income was earned in the 1st quarter\nand $10,000 was earned in the 2nd quarter, you would\nadd those amounts together and enter $15,000 as earned\non line 10.l of the 2nd quarter’s SF-425. Similarly, if you\nspent $5,000 in program income in the 1st quarter and an\nadditional $10,000 of program income in the 2nd quarter,\nyou would enter $15,000 as expended on line 10.m of the\n2nd quarter’s SF-425. In the event of an audit or other award compliance\nreview, your agency should maintain detailed records that\nidentify the specific project activity source (e.g., conference\nregistration fees) and the amount of all program income\ngenerated. Line 12 (“Remarks”) on the SF-425 can be useful\nto provide narrative explanations supporting the financial\ninformation entered. Table 1. Program income on the SF-425\nNote: Use lines 10.d–10.o for single award reporting only. Do not complete these lines if reporting on multiple awards. LINE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIPTION 10.l Total federal program income earned Enter the amount of federal program income earned. Do not report\nany program income here that is being allocated as part of the recipient’s\ncost-sharing amount included in line 10.j. 10.m Program income expended in accordance\nwith the deduction alternative Enter the amount of program income that was used to reduce the federal\nshare of the total project costs. 10.n Program income expended in accordance\nwith the addition alternative Enter the amount of program income that was approved and expended\non the project. 10.o Unexpended program income (Line l\nminus line m or line n) Enter the remaining amount of unexpended program income by taking\nline l and either subtracting line m or line n, depending on which method\nyou are using. 3.

Program Income Can recipients keep program income as a cash\nreserve for future project costs? No. Recipients should expend earned program income before\ndrawing down award funds. 5 How much time is available to spend\nprogram income? Allowable project expenses can be supported by earned\nprogram income during the open award period. Funds\ncannot be drawn down for expenses that are incurred after\nthe award end date. Avoid retaining earned program income for extended periods\nof time. If you anticipate a significant lapse of time occurring\nbetween earning and spending program income, contact your\nCOPS Office program manager or grant program specialist. Unused program income should be deposited into your\nCOPS Office award account to reduce your federal share. 6 These funds remain available for future use on allowable\ncosts, incurred before award expiration, to fully implement\nyour project. 3 Unused program income remaining 90 days after the award\nend date must be promptly returned to the COPS Office. Please contact your COPS"
