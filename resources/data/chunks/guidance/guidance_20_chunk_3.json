  "chunk_text": "The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed for any\nallowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your CAMP award is two years (24 months). Your award number is in the following format: 2019-AMWX-0000 for awards funded in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. The\nCOPS Office tracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency’s\naward number (or your agency’s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If you have any questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your\nagency’s ORI number when you contact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency’s nine- or thirteendigit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP vendor\nnumber differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for administrative\npurposes in connection with this award program, and should not be used for IRS purposes. 2 2019 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual Award terms and conditions The award terms and conditions are listed on your agency’s award document.
