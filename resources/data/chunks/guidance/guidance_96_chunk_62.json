The guidance\nprovides recommendations to award recipients seeking funding for interoperable emergency communications\nprojects, including allowable costs, items to consider when funding emergency communications projects, awards\nmanagement best practices for emergency communications awards, and information on standards that ensure\ngreater interoperability. The guidance is intended to ensure that federally funded investments are compatible and\nsupport national goals and objectives for improving interoperability nationwide. Recipients (including subrecipients) that are using CPD funds to support emergency communications activities should comply with the latest\nversion of SAFECOM Guidance, including provisions on technical standards that ensure and enhance interoperable\ncommunications. The most recent version of SAFECOM guidance is available at\nwww.safecomprogram.gov/grant/Default.aspx. Quality and accuracy of data\nInformation is only as good as its source; therefore, it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information from various\nsources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked to one another and\nchecked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance\nmeasurement. Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions\nto the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused\ninto all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about\ntheir responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A major conceptual\nvehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way is the SARA\n(scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the\nscope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the\nselected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents similar\nin one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a\nplace, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from\nthe community, should identify and prioritize concerns. 66 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process."
