The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the primary system\nthat agencies use for EFT. An award recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made since July\n2009. For more information regarding GPRS, please visit the following website to view the GPRS User Guide:\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm. Setting up your account How do we set up a new GPRS account? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your organization should determine which authorized employee(s)\nwill be responsible for requesting federal funds for your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The\nindividual(s) selected must click on the following link and register with the GPRS system to become a drawdown\nspecialist for your organization: https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome. Once you have been approved, you will receive an email containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your agency executive\nand/or financial official to validate the information that was provided during the registration process. All\nindividuals that need access to GPRS must register separately and create their own unique GPRS username\naccount, as these accounts are not meant to be shared. How do we add an award to an existing GPRS account? If you are currently registered for an active COPS Office award username in GPRS and would like to add a recently\nfunded COPS Office award number to your existing COPS Office award username, contact the COPS Office GPRS\nregistration team via email at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information:\n•\n•\n•\n• User name (for COPS Office awards) First/last name\nVendor number (as listed on your award document)\nAward number(s) to be added 50 How do we fill out the payment enrollment forms? If you are a new award recipient to the COPS Office, your organization will need to complete an Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment enrollment form (SF-3881). This form can be found on the\nCOPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf. Prior to accessing your award funds, your organization must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001\nYour organization must complete the “Payee/Company Information” section following the directions on the back\nof the form and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial institution\nmust complete the “Financial Institution Information” section and have the appropriate financial official sign the\nform. If you are already a COPS Office award recipient, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your organization will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long\nas your OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment\nform information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Financial Analyst. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed?"
