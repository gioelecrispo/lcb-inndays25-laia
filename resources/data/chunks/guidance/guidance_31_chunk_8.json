  "chunk_text": "In addition, your\nagency must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect any rate change. If your agency has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, then you may request up to a flat 10 percent de\nminimis indirect cost rate applied to the modified total direct costs (MTDC). In addition, before the COPS Office officially closes out your agency’s award, your agency must reconcile any\nchanges between your approved final indirect cost rate and approved provisional indirect cost rate and, if\nnecessary, repay the COPS Office for any indirect cost rate overpayment. If your agency draws down excess COPS\nOffice award funding for indirect costs, please return the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a revised\nFederal Financial Report (SF-425). Visit the COPS Office website for more information on indirect costs:\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2017AwardDocs/ctas/Indirect_Cost_Rate_Fact_Sheet.pdf. Please be advised that recipients may not use COPS Office funding for the same item or service also funded by\nanother U.S. Department of Justice award. See also award condition on “Duplicative Funding.” 4. Supplementing, Not Supplanting\nCondition:\nState, local, and tribal governments recipients must use award funds to supplement, and not supplant, state, local,\nor Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds that are already committed or otherwise would have been committed for\naward purposes (hiring, training, purchases, and/or activities) during the award period. In other words, recipients\nmay not use COPS Office funds to supplant (replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to\nthe COPS Office-funded item(s) in the absence of the COPS Office award (34 U.S.C. § 10384(a)). Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds will not be used to replace\nstate or local funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made available\nfor the award purposes. Instead, TRGP award funds must be used to increase the total amount of funds that would\notherwise be made available for hiring or rehiring law enforcement officers. What you should do:\nTRGP-Hiring recipients may not use award funds to pay for any item or cost funded under the award (equipment,\npersonnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA funds or committed\nto the recipient’s budget. In addition, recipients may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within\nthe law enforcement budget to another as a result of receiving TRGP award funds. If you have questions\nconcerning this award term and how it pertains to your project budget, please contact your COPS Office Grant\nProgram Specialist. 7 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nTRGP-Hiring—to meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n• If your agency is redeploying a current employee to perform the work duties of the TRGP-Hiring position, the\nredeployed position must be paid with local funds. The COPS Office award funds may be used to backfill the\nresulting vacancy with newly hired personnel for an equivalent amount of time."
