The 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) provides funding\ndirectly to federally recognized tribal jurisdictions with established law enforcement agencies. TRGP was designed\nto expand the implementation of community policing and meet the most serious needs of law enforcement in\ntribal communities through a broadened comprehensive program. In Fiscal Year 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a single Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation\n(CTAS) that encompassed the department’s available Tribal Government–specific award programs. CTAS enabled\neach tribe to submit a single application for available award funding according to the tribes’ needs."

CTAS enabled\neach tribe to submit a single application for available award funding according to the tribes’ needs. This\ncoordinated process allowed the DOJ to review a single application from a tribe, and it allowed the DOJ awardmaking components to coordinate in making award decisions to address these public safety needs on a more\ncomprehensive basis. The 2018 TRGP, which is also CTAS Purpose Area #1: Public Safety and Community Policing, consists of two types of\nawards. The TRGP-Hiring awards are for entry-level salaries and benefits for newly hired or rehired career law\nenforcement officers, and the TRGP-Equipment/Training (TRGP-E/T) awards provide funding for background\ninvestigations, training, uniforms, basic issue equipment, technology, and vehicles for tribal law enforcement\nagencies. To support community policing, particularly the development of partnerships and problem solving, 2018 TRGP\nrecipients may be offered training and technical assistance by COPS Office training and technical assistance\nproviders. Trainings will assist recipients in the advancement of community policing and may address specific\npublic safety issues facing tribal communities. The COPS Office or its technical assistance providers will notify TRGP\nrecipients about training and technical assistance opportunities. Recipients are encouraged to participate in the\ntraining and technical assistance opportunities to further their public safety efforts. This COPS Office TRGP Award Owner’s Manual will assist your agency with the administrative and financial matters\nassociated with managing your award. It was developed by the COPS Office to ensure that all TRGP recipients\nclearly understand and meet the requirements of their award. Please review this manual carefully, because a\nfailure to follow award requirements may result in serious penalties. Please do not hesitate to call the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 if you need assistance with the implementation of your award. Thank you for providing us with the opportunity to work in partnership with your community. 1 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual I.

The duration of TRGP-Hiring and TRGP-E/T awards is three years (36\nmonths). TRGP-Hiring recipients are awarded three years (36 months) of funding for each position funded. Your award number is in the following format: 2018-HEWX-0000 for TRGP-E/T awards and 2018-HHWX-0000 for\nTRGP-Hiring awards funded in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. The COPS Office tracks award information based upon this\nnumber. Therefore, it is important to have your agency’s award number (or your agency’s ORI number) readily\navailable when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If you have any questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your\nagency’s ORI number when you contact the COPS Office. 2 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nYour Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency’s 9- or 13-digit federal\ntax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

If you have any\nquestions, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. When accepting your award, you should\nensure that the proper reporting and financial systems are in place to satisfy the award requirements. 2. Assurances and Certifications\nCondition: The recipient acknowledges its agreement to comply with the Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed\nas part of its application. Why this condition:\nAlthough the COPS Office has made every effort to simplify the process of applying for and receiving awards,\nseveral provisions of federal law require us to seek your Assurances and Certification regarding certain matters. Most of the Assurances and Certifications apply to all federal award programs. What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS Office award programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at the time\nof application. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have read, understood, and accepted the\naward terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications. Your agency is required to keep\n4 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nAssurances and Certifications forms that were signed as part of its award application.

Allowable Costs\nCondition: The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs to meet the most serious needs of law\nenforcement in tribal communities. The allowable costs for which your agency’s award has been approved are\nlimited to those listed on the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which are included in your agency’s award\npackage. The FCM specifies the amount of TRGP Hiring funds awarded to your agency. You should carefully review your FCM,\nwhich contains the final officer salary and fringe benefit categories and amounts for which your agency was\napproved. Please note that the salary and fringe benefit costs requested in your award application may have been\nadjusted or removed. Your agency may only be reimbursed for the approved cost categories that are documented\nwithin the FCM, up to the amounts specified in the FCM. Your agency may not use TRGP Hiring award funds for any\ncosts that are not identified as allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual allowable costs\nincurred during the award period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown."

      "content": "Your agency may not use TRGP Hiring award funds for any\ncosts that are not identified as allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual allowable costs\nincurred during the award period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown. If your agency experiences any\ncost savings over the course of the award (for example, your award application overestimated the total entry-level\nofficer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use that excess funding to extend the length of the\naward beyond 36 months. Any funds remaining after your agency has drawn down for the costs of approved\nsalaries and fringe benefits incurred for each awarded position during the 36-month funding period for each\nawarded position will be deobligated during the closeout process, and should not be spent by your agency. Why this condition:\nTRGP-Hiring funds may be used only to pay entry-level salaries and fringe benefits for 36 months for full time\ncareer law enforcement officers hired or rehired on or after the award start date. You may use the TRGP award to\nhire or rehire experienced officers, but award funding must be limited to paying your agency’s entry-level salary\nand fringe benefits; any costs higher than entry level must be paid by your agency with local funds. TRGP-Hiring award funding may also be used to pay the approved entry-level salaries and fringe benefits of newly\nhired officer recruits while they are in basic academy training prior to swearing them in, if it is your agency’s\nstandard practice to pay recruits while in training. What you should do: All recipients should keep and maintain the most recent, approved version of 2017 TRGP application, which will\ncontain the approved costs for this award. Refer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable costs. As long as\nfunds are spent during the award period on the approved salaries and benefits (as applicable), equipment,\ntechnology, training, or other costs that were documented in your application’s budget summary and were\napproved through the issuance of the FCM, this award condition will be satisfied. The award number should be 5 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nindicated on all budgetary documentation including purchase orders, receipts, and other documentation. All\nrecipients should keep and maintain the most recent, approved version of their 2017 TRGP application for future\nreference. Salaries covered by TRGP-Hiring must be based on your agency’s standard entry-level salary and fringe benefits\npackage under the laws or rules that govern hiring by your agency. Salary and fringe benefits payments must be\nbased on payroll records supported by time and attendance records or their equivalent. Examples of the types of\nrecords your agency must keep to document allowable costs are described in this manual. Any additional costs\nabove the approved entry-level salaries and fringe benefits are the responsibility of the recipient agency. Civilian\npositions, overtime, training, weapons, equipment, and vehicles cannot be funded with your TRGP-Hiring award. Allowable costs: Officer approved salary and benefits The FCM, included in your award package, specifies the approved amount of COPS Office TRGP-Hiring funds\nawarded to your agency for officer salaries and approved benefits."

Allowable costs: Officer approved salary and benefits The FCM, included in your award package, specifies the approved amount of COPS Office TRGP-Hiring funds\nawarded to your agency for officer salaries and approved benefits. Please note that the salary and benefit costs\nrequested in your original application may have been updated or corrected from the original version submitted to\nthe COPS Office. Your agency may only be reimbursed for the approved cost categories and amounts that are\ndocumented within the FCM. In addition, your agency may not use TRGP funds for any costs that are not identified\nas allowable in the FCM. Allowable costs: Indirect costs The recipient understands that indirect costs may only be requested at the time of application. A current, signed,\nfederally approved Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement or documentation showing pending request for\napproval must be included with the application. Indirect costs are costs that are incurred for common or joint purposes and are not readily assignable to a\nparticular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance of the project. Examples\nof indirect costs include those incurred for facility operation and maintenance, depreciation, and administrative\nsalaries. Indirect cost usage must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of Management and\nBudget (OMB) Uniform Guidance 2 C.F.R. § 200.56—Indirect (facilities & administrative (F&A)) costs and 2 C.F.R. §\n200.414—Indirect (F&A) costs. Additional guidance for your entity can be found in the following locations:\nAppendix III to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for\nInstitutions of Higher Education (IHEs); Appendix IV to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and\nAssignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations; Appendix VII to Part 200—States and Local\nGovernment and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals. Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses that are approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency carefully\ntrack and update its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office award period. The recipient understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of application, it\nwill be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a current indirect cost rate\nagreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the award prohibiting the obligation,\nexpenditure, or drawdown of funds reimbursement for indirect costs until a current indirect cost rate has been\napproved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS Office. 6 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual If your agency’s approved indirect cost rate expires during the award period, a current approved rate must be\nsubmitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down award funding for indirect costs. In addition, your\nagency must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect any rate change."

If your agency has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, then you may request up to a flat 10 percent de\nminimis indirect cost rate applied to the modified total direct costs (MTDC). In addition, before the COPS Office officially closes out your agency’s award, your agency must reconcile any\nchanges between your approved final indirect cost rate and approved provisional indirect cost rate and, if\nnecessary, repay the COPS Office for any indirect cost rate overpayment. If your agency draws down excess COPS\nOffice award funding for indirect costs, please return the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a revised\nFederal Financial Report (SF-425). Visit the COPS Office website for more information on indirect costs:\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2017AwardDocs/ctas/Indirect_Cost_Rate_Fact_Sheet.pdf. Please be advised that recipients may not use COPS Office funding for the same item or service also funded by\nanother U.S. Department of Justice award. See also award condition on “Duplicative Funding.” 4. Supplementing, Not Supplanting\nCondition:\nState, local, and tribal governments recipients must use award funds to supplement, and not supplant, state, local,\nor Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds that are already committed or otherwise would have been committed for\naward purposes (hiring, training, purchases, and/or activities) during the award period. In other words, recipients\nmay not use COPS Office funds to supplant (replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to\nthe COPS Office-funded item(s) in the absence of the COPS Office award (34 U.S.C. § 10384(a)). Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds will not be used to replace\nstate or local funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made available\nfor the award purposes. Instead, TRGP award funds must be used to increase the total amount of funds that would\notherwise be made available for hiring or rehiring law enforcement officers. What you should do:\nTRGP-Hiring recipients may not use award funds to pay for any item or cost funded under the award (equipment,\npersonnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA funds or committed\nto the recipient’s budget. In addition, recipients may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within\nthe law enforcement budget to another as a result of receiving TRGP award funds. If you have questions\nconcerning this award term and how it pertains to your project budget, please contact your COPS Office Grant\nProgram Specialist. 7 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nTRGP-Hiring—to meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n• If your agency is redeploying a current employee to perform the work duties of the TRGP-Hiring position, the\nredeployed position must be paid with local funds. The COPS Office award funds may be used to backfill the\nresulting vacancy with newly hired personnel for an equivalent amount of time."

The COPS Office award funds may be used to backfill the\nresulting vacancy with newly hired personnel for an equivalent amount of time. Each individual employed\nunder the TRGP-Hiring award must be newly hired or rehired on or after the award start date unless an\nexception is authorized in writing by the COPS Office. • Any officer your agency hires brings your force not only to a number over and above the number of funded\npositions that you had on the date of your Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS), including funded\nbut vacant positions, but also to a number over and above the number of locally funded officer positions\nduring the award period. • During the life of your award, your agency must continue to hire as many new, locally funded officers as you\nwould have hired if you had not received your award. Your agency may not cancel or postpone spending\nmoney in its budget that is committed to hiring other new officers. • Your agency must take active and timely steps to fill any vacancies that were created on or after the date of\nyour award application by retirement, resignation, or other reasons with new officers in addition to your\nTRGP-Hiring award-funded positions. Note: This award condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your agency\nunder this award. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any partner agencies use COPS Office funds only to\nsupplement, not supplant, their state, local, or BIA funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 36 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted nocost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include difficulties in filling COPS Office-funded positions, officer\nturnover, or other circumstances that interrupt the 36-month award funding period. An extension allows your\nagency to compensate for such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding for\neach position awarded. Extension requests must be received prior to the end date of the award. 2 C.F.R. §\n200.308(d)(2). Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do:"

Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time\nextension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the award due to salary and fringe benefits costs that were\nlower than anticipated, your agency may not extend the 36-month funding period for the purpose of expending\nthose excess funds. Recipients are entitled to a maximum of 36 months of federal funding based on the approved\nsalary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining award funds during the\ncloseout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time extension, please contact your\nCOPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency’s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS Office\nTRGP Hiring program award. Award modifications under the program are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in\naccordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.308. For federal awards in excess of $250,000, any modification request involving\nthe reallocation of funding between budget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of\nthe total approved budget requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award\namount or budget modification percentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In\naddition, any budget modification that changes the scope of the project requires prior written approval by the COPS\nOffice. Furthermore, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that results in\nan increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Under federal regulations, you are\nrequired to expend federal funds only as approved in the FCM. Requests to change or alter an award that meet\ncertain threshold requirements must be submitted to the COPS Office for written approval, prior to their purchase\nor implementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it was\noriginally outlined and accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within\nthe original scope of the award."

Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within\nthe original scope of the award. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs (e.g.,\nconstruction) will not be approved. Your agency may reprogram its budget up to an aggregate (over the course of your project) of 10 percent of the\ntotal project cost without prior written approval from the COPS Office. However, you should notify your COPS\nOffice Grant Program Specialist of any reprogramming that falls below the 10 percent threshold as well. For\nawards in excess of $250,000, any reprogramming of funds that totals an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the\napproved budget requires prior written approval from the COPS Office. What you should do: You are required to notify your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist if you determine that your agency will need\nto reprogram award funds. If your modification exceeds an aggregated (over the course of your project) 10 percent\nof your overall award, your agency must access https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. 9 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nPlease contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist for further direction on any additional requirements that\nmay apply to your modification request. The COPS Office will then evaluate your request and notify your agency of\nour decision in writing. Implementation of the modified award budget may begin following written approval from\nthe COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for active awards will be accompanied by a modified FCM\nreflecting the approved changes. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of its award programs. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators (34 U.S.C. § 10385(b)). Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may be\ncarried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may be improved, and why\ncertain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which your\nagency implements its TRGP award. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or evaluators may study the\neffectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the programs’\neffect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask questions about\nthe challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel about community policing, and\nhow police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other communities and police agencies across\nthe country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and\ninformation-gathering activities."

You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and\ninformation-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information about\nyour award activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.327 200.328. The progress report is used to track your agency’s progress toward implementing community policing\nstrategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency’s community policing capacity\nthrough COPS Office funding. The Federal Financial Report is used to track the expenditures of the recipient’s award\nfunds on a cumulative basis throughout the life of the award. 10 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government must be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress of\nour programs and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with TRGP\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the “Account Access” tab on the COPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within\n30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the award\nperiod. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period, and the\nremaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw\ndown federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date, however you will have a 90-day grace\nperiod after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before\nthe award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic or financial report submission per\nfiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to\nreceive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting requirements. These reports are discussed in\ngreater detail in the section titled “Reporting Requirements” in this manual. All reports should be submitted within\nthe deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions; failure\nto submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities."

All reports should be submitted within\nthe deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions; failure\nto submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both\naspects of award implementation—compliance and programmatic benefits—are part of the monitoring process\ncoordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include\nsite visits, enhanced office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic\nreporting, and audit resolution. As a COPS Office award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any\nrequests for information pertaining to your award. This includes all financial records, such as general accounting\nledgers and all supporting documents. All information pertinent to the implementation of the award is subject to\nagency review throughout the life of the award, during the close-out process and for three-years after the\nsubmission of the final expenditure report. 34 U.S.C. § 10385(a) and 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.333 & 200.336. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain a\nmonitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are complying with COPS Office award\nrequirements. In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance to help\nensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards. 11 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency’s use of federal funds both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients’ compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to conduct\nsite visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is three-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions on how to prepare\nfor the review of their COPS Office awards. The site visit is generally performed over a period of one or\nmore days. Compliance reviews will be conducted for active awards to address any noncompliance and/or\nadministrative issues identified during the review. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any\nidentified noncompliance issues while on-site, or if necessary, following the site visit. In addition,\nrecipients will have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR)."

In addition,\nrecipients will have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an EOBGR\nconducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative for\nconducting site visit reviews in support of the COPS Office’s overall award monitoring strategy. The purpose of\nthe EOBGR is three-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Compliance reviews will be conducted for\nactive awards to address any noncompliance and/or administrative issues identified during the review. In\naddition, award recipients will receive customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a noncompliance\nissue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media,\ncitizens, law enforcement agencies, other federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case basis,\nCOPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints\nof alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the\nOffice of the Inspector General (OIG). Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or non-violation based upon\nthe supporting documentation and/or other factors used to make a determination for compliance or noncompliance. 12 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\n4. Audit Liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event\nyour agency is audited by the OIG and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance and/or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with your\nagency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may include\nrepayment of award funds and/or providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance and/or\nproviding proof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the causes for the\nnoncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO)."

Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award funds,\nor a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time. Under certain conditions, additional\nactions may include referral and placement on the U.S. Department of Justice’s High Risk List, which will include\nmandatory completion of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Financial Management Training and being subject to\nincreased monitoring of current and future awards while on the list. In the event of criminal misuse of award\nfunds, recipients may also be subject to fines and imprisonment. To avoid findings of noncompliance, recipients\nare strongly encouraged to become familiar with the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division’s Grant Monitoring\nStandards and Guidelines and Award Owner’s Manual for the year in which the award was made. Recipients\nshould also contact their COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at any time during the life of a COPS Office award\nwith questions concerning award conditions, terms, or requirements to seek guidance to avoid noncompliance. It\nis necessary for recipients to maintain all relevant documentation (administrative, financial, and programmatic)\nused to develop the application and implement the award that may be necessary or required to demonstrate\naward compliance.

The Applicant also understands that (in addition to any applicable program-specific regulations and to applicable\nfederal regulations that pertain to civil rights and nondiscrimination) the federal regulations applicable to the\naward (if any) made by the Department based on the application may include, but are not limited to, 2 C.F.R. Part\n2800 (the DOJ \"Part 200 Uniform Requirements\") and 28 C.F.R. Parts 22 (confidentiality - research and statistical\ninformation), 23 (criminal intelligence systems), 38 (regarding faith-based or religious organizations participating in\nfederal financial assistance programs), and 46 (human subjects protection). Why this condition: In establishing financial assistance programs, Congress linked the receipt of federal funding to compliance with\nfederal civil rights laws. As a result, recipients are required to comply with the civil rights requirements found in\nthe nondiscrimination provisions referenced above. A hold may be placed on your award if it is deemed that your\nagency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an ongoing federal civil rights\ninvestigation. If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate or draw down federal funds under\nyour agency’s COPS Office award until you comply with federal civil rights laws or cooperate with any ongoing\nfederal civil rights investigation. What you should do:\nIncluded with your award package is a memorandum from the Office for Civil Rights, Office of Justice Programs,\nU.S. Department of Justice, which addresses the federal civil rights statutes and regulations applicable to your\naward. You should review this memorandum to understand your agency’s civil rights responsibilities. As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the applicable\nfederal civil rights laws, to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective enforcement of such laws,\nand to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes providing access to records, accounts,\ndocuments, information, facilities, and staff. 11. Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP)\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus Crime\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that established the COPS Office, that “the full\nand equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal justice\nsystem is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act’s program to reduce crime and delinquency in the United\nStates” 28 C.F.R. § 42.301.

Total value of currently active awards, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts\nincludes— (1) Only the Federal share of the funding under any Federal award with a recipient cost share or\nmatch; and\n(2) The value of all expected funding increments under a Federal award and options, even if not\nyet exercised. 28 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition:\nUnder 2 C.F.R. § 200.210 (b) (1) (iii), recipients of awards in excess of $500,000 are required to report certain civil,\ncriminal, and administrative proceedings if they have active federal grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts\n(or any combination of these) that total more than $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period. The purpose\nis to protect the public interest and to ensure proper management in federal activities by conducting business with\nresponsible parties. What you should do: If the total value of your active grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts from all federal awarding agencies\nexceeds $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period, then you must ensure that the proceedings described\nin paragraph 2 of this award term that are reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) are current. The\ninformation about the reported proceedings is made available in SAM via the designated integrity and\nperformance system (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)). During the award period, you must either report for the most recent five year period new information about any\nproceeding(s) that you have not reported previously or affirm that there is no new information to report. You must\nalso disclose semiannually any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings. 25. Computer Network Requirement\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees that no award funds may be used to maintain or establish a computer\nnetwork unless such network blocks the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. Nothing in this\nrequirement limits the use of funds necessary for any federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any\nother entity carrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2018, Public Law 115-141, Division B, Title II, Section 531. Why this condition:\nSection 531 of Division B, Title II, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Pub. L. 115-141) prohibits the use\nof federal funds to maintain or establish a computer network that does not block the viewing, downloading, and\nexchanging of pornography. This provision protects the public interest in the proper management and use of\nfederal funds. What you should do: The recipient must not use award funds to maintain or establish a computer network unless the network blocks\npornography. This does not limit the use of funds for criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. 26. Community Policing\nCondition:\nCommunity policing activities to be initiated or enhanced by your agency were identified and described in your\naward application. All equipment, technology, training, and/or sworn officer positions awarded under the TRGP\nHiring award must be linked to the implementation or enhancement of community policing. 34 U.S.C. § 10382\n(c)(10).\n29 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition:"

      "content": "All equipment, technology, training, and/or sworn officer positions awarded under the TRGP\nHiring award must be linked to the implementation or enhancement of community policing. 34 U.S.C. § 10382\n(c)(10).\n29 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition: The COPS Office defines community policing as a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support\nthe systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the immediate\nconditions giving rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. TRGP-Hiring awards\nmust be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities. All newly hired, additional, or rehired officers (or\nan equal number of redeployed veteran officers) funded under TRGP-Hiring must engage in community policing\nactivities. While the COPS Office recognizes that your COPS Office-funded officer(s) (or an equal number of\nredeployed veteran officers) will participate in some or all aspects of your identified community policing plan and\nadvance your agency’s community policing activities over the life of the award, we also encourage your agency to\nmove toward an organization-wide philosophy and commitment to community policing. COPS Office awards are designed to increase community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This is\nachieved through problem-solving tactics and community policing partnerships. It enhances police professionalism\nby providing officers with the skills and motivation to act in innovative ways to solve community crime-related\nproblems. Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure that it is initiating or enhancing community\npolicing in accordance with your proposed plan, and that the officers hired (or an equal number of redeployed\nveteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance your agency’s community policing activities over the\nlife of the award. The COPS Office may also use this information to understand the needs of the field and\npotentially provide for training, technical assistance, problem solving, and community policing implementation\ntools. What you should do: The community policing activities designated for implementation or enhancement by your agency were identified\nin your TRGP application. Your community policing needs may change during the life of your award, and minor\nchanges to this plan may be made without prior approval of the COPS Office. If your agency’s community policing\nplan changes significantly you must submit those changes in writing to the COPS Office for approval. Changes are\nsignificant if they deviate from the range of possible community policing activities identified and approved in the\noriginal community policing plan submitted with your application. 27. Retention\nCondition: At the time of award application, your agency committed to retaining all sworn officer positions funded under the\nTRGP-Hiring award with state and/or local funds for a minimum of 12 months following the conclusion of 36\nmonths of federal funding for each position, over and above the number of locally-funded sworn officer positions\nthat would have existed in the absence of the award. Your agency cannot satisfy the retention requirement by using\nTRGP-Hiring-funded positions to fill locally-funded vacancies resulting from attrition. Why this condition: The retention requirement ensures that the increased officer staffing level under the TRGP-Hiring award continues\nwith state or local funds for a minimum of 12 months after federal funding ends."

Why this condition: The retention requirement ensures that the increased officer staffing level under the TRGP-Hiring award continues\nwith state or local funds for a minimum of 12 months after federal funding ends. 30 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual What you should do: At the time of the TRGP application, your agency was required to affirm that it planned to retain all sworn officer\npositions awarded under the TRGP-Hiring award and identify the planned source(s) of retention funding. Your\nagency committed to retaining each awarded position for at least 12 months following the conclusion of 36\nmonths of federal funding for that position. The retention period begins for an awarded officer position once that\nposition has completed the 36-month implementation period. If an agency is awarded several officer positions, the\nretention period for each individual officer position begins upon completion of 36 months of funding for that\nposition (not based on the cumulative award end date). The retained TRGP funded position(s) must be added to your agency’s law enforcement budget with state or local\nfunds at the conclusion of grant funding, over and above the number of locally funded sworn officer positions that\nwould have existed in the absence of the award. Absorbing TRGP-funded positions through attrition (rather than\nadding the extra positions to your budget with additional funding) does not meet the retention requirement. Your agency should maintain documentation demonstrating when the 36-month award funding period expires for\neach awarded position and that each retained position is above and beyond the number of officer positions that\nyour agency would otherwise have funded with state or local funds. We understand that your agency’s identified\nsource(s) of retention funding may change during the life of the award, so your agency should maintain\ndocumentation of any changes in the event of an audit, monitoring, or other evaluation of your award compliance. Please note that your agency is required to retain the officer position(s) awarded under the TRGP-Hiring award and\nnot the specific officer(s) hired to fill the award position(s). If a position funded by the TRGP-Hiring award becomes\nvacant during the retention period, your agency is required to take active and timely steps consistent with your\nagency’s hiring policies and procedures to fill the position with a new officer to complete the remainder of the 12month retention period. Your agency should maintain documentation demonstrating that you did not delay filling\nthe position and that the steps your agency took to fill the position were consistent with your hiring policies and\nprocedures. At the conclusion of federal funding, agencies that fail to retain the sworn officer positions awarded under the\nTRGP-Hiring award may be ineligible to receive future COPS Office awards for a period of three years. If your\nagency is unable to retain any of the awarded officer positions, you should contact your COPS Office Grant\nProgram Specialist for further review."

Contracts with Other Jurisdictions\nCondition:\nSworn law enforcement officer positions awarded must be used for law enforcement activities or services that\nbenefit your agency and the population that it serves. The items funded under the TRGP-Hiring award cannot be\nutilized by other agencies unless the items benefit the population that your agency serves. Your agency may use\nitems funded under the TRGP-Hiring award to assist other law enforcement agencies under a resource sharing,\nmutual aid, or other agreement to address multi-jurisdictional issues as described in the agreement. 31 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition: The TRGP was created under a Congressional appropriation specifically designated for tribal law enforcement\nagencies to improve public safety in Indian communities. The TRGP-Hiring award funding is intended to benefit the\ncommunities within the recipient’s primary law enforcement jurisdiction. Therefore, the recipient must use TRGP\naward funding to benefit its own population. What you should do: Your law enforcement agency should avoid any agreements with other jurisdictions to share officer positions or\nother awarded equipment, technology, or vehicles unless the agreement complies with the requirement that COPS\nOffice-funded items must benefit the recipient service population. For example, if your jurisdiction has a tribal\npolice department and a BIA department, items funded under the award might be able to be used by the BIA\ndepartment as long as this would result in a benefit to the population that you serve. You may not, however, allow\nofficers, equipment, technology, or vehicles funded under the award to be used by any agency or transferred to\nany agency that does not benefit the population that you serve. For example, you may not, during the award term,\nloan two of your awarded computers to a neighboring county’s sheriff’s department. Officers funded under TRGP-Hiring may not provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies unless\nthey will directly benefit the recipient’s jurisdiction. For example, your agency may not use an officer funded under\nTRGP-Hiring to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but your agency may use the\nofficer to provide direct law enforcement services to the population within your agency’s own jurisdiction. If your\nagency has an agreement with another law enforcement agency for resource sharing, mutual aid, etc. TRGP-Hiring\nofficers may respond to requests for assistance and participate in multi-jurisdictional activities as described in the\nagreement. Before you enter into any agreement with another law enforcement agency, you should contact your COPS Office\nGrant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770 for additional guidance.

If you have any\nquestions, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. When accepting your award, you should\nensure that the proper reporting and financial systems are in place to satisfy the award requirements. 2. Assurances and Certifications\nCondition: The recipient acknowledges its agreement to comply with the Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed\nas part of its application. Why this condition:\nAlthough the COPS Office has made every effort to simplify the process of applying for and receiving awards,\nseveral provisions of federal law require us to seek your Assurances and Certification regarding certain matters. Most of the Assurances and Certifications apply to all federal award programs. What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS Office award programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at the time\nof application. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have read, understood, and accepted the\naward terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications. Your agency is required to keep\nAssurances and Certifications forms that were signed as part of its award application. Please read these documents\ncarefully, because signatures on these documents are treated as a material representation of fact upon which\nreliance will be placed when the U.S. Department of Justice determines whether to fund the covered award. Additional copies of the Assurances and Certifications forms are contained in appendix B of this manual. If you\nhave any questions about the Assurances and Certifications, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program\nSpecialist at 800-421-6770. 3.

The allowable costs for which your agency’s award has been approved are\nlimited to those listed on the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which is included in your agency’s award\npackage. The FCM specifies the exact items that your agency is allowed to fund with your TRGP Equipment/Training\naward and specifies the overall amount approved for each budget request category.

Allowable costs: Background investigations\nBased on the FCM, recipients may have been awarded funding for background investigations for newly hired\nofficer positions if other funding (state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)) was not budgeted for the same\nbackground investigations. Background investigations must be completed before expenses incurred in connection\nwith such investigations can be reimbursed. Funded background investigations may not be initiated prior to the\nofficial start date of the award period. Allowable costs: Training\nBased on the FCM, recipients may have been awarded funding for otherwise unfunded expenses associated with\nsending recruits to a state academy that will train and certify tribal police officers, to the BIA Indian Police\nAcademy in Artesia, New Mexico, or to basic training from an established academy that trains Indian police officers\nsuch as the Navajo Nation’s Academy. Basic law enforcement training is encouraged for existing police officers who\nhave not received it, depending on the needs of your department and the availability of funding. Award funding\nmay only be used for one cycle of basic training per officer. The recipient agency will be responsible for any\nadditional costs associated with an officer not completing basic training on the first attempt. 34 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nTRGP funds may also pay for community policing and problem-solving training; specialized law enforcement\ntraining in such topics as counterterrorism, family violence, and crime prevention and detection; and training\nrelated to Indian Country jurisdictional issues. Only requests for training by recognized training providers such as\nthe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, the FBI, the BIA Indian Police Academy, a state police academy,\nCOPS Office Regional Community Policing Institutes, or a tribal community college will be considered. In addition,\nfunding may be used to attend training conferences such as the National Native American Law Enforcement\nAssociation’s annual training conference or any COPS Office-sponsored conference. Funding for community policing or other law enforcement training will cover only travel, lodging, and per diem\nexpenses for each representative to and from the training site (if training is conducted more than 50 miles from\nyour agency headquarters). State academy training costs include training instruction fees, academy tuition, course\nfees, textbooks, manuals, supplies, and travel in connection with the training (transportation, lodging, per diem,\netc.) if the training is located more than 50 miles from the job site. If your state academy does not charge for the\ntraining, your department will be reimbursed only for travel in connection with the training. Departments that\nsend officers to the BIA Indian Police Academy will be reimbursed for travel costs only, as there is no cost for\ntuition at the BIA Indian Police Academy for tribal officers.

If your agency draws down excess COPS\nOffice award funding for indirect costs, please return the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a revised\nFederal Financial Report (SF-425). See the COPS Office website for a fact sheet on indirect costs,\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2017AwardDocs/ctas/Indirect_Cost_Rate_Fact_Sheet.pdf. Please be advised that recipients may not use COPS Office funding for the same item or service also funded by\nanother U.S. Department of Justice award. See also award condition on “Duplicative Funding.” Note that certain “Controlled Equipment” as described in the “Recommendations Pursuant to EXECUTIVE\nORDER 13688 Federal Support for Local Law Enforcement Equipment Acquisition,” available at\nhttps://ojp.gov/docs/LE-Equipment-WG-Final-Report.pdf may be disallowed or require additional justification\nand certifications. 4. Supplementing, Not Supplanting\nCondition:\nState, local, and tribal governments must use TRGP Equipment/Training award funds to supplement, and not\nsupplant, state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds that are already committed or otherwise would have\nbeen committed for award purposes (hiring, training, purchases, and/or activities) during the award period. In\nother words, recipients may not use COPS Office funds to supplant (replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would\nhave been dedicated to the COPS Office-funded item(s) in the absence of the COPS Office award (34 U.S.C. §\n10384(a))). Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds may not be used to replace\nstate or local funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made available\nfor the award purposes. What you should do:\nTRGP-E/T recipients may not use award funds to pay for any item or cost funded under the award (equipment,\npersonnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA funds or committed\nto the recipient’s budget. If you have questions concerning this award term, and how it pertains to your project\nbudget, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. In addition, recipients may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within the law enforcement\nbudget to another as a result of receiving TRGP award funds. For example, recipients who have budgeted funds to\npay for new computer equipment may not reallocate those funds to pay for any other law enforcement cost as a\nresult of receiving TRGP-E/T award funds for the same computer equipment. 38"

Funds currently allocated to purchase equipment or technology may not be\nreallocated to other purposes or reimbursed upon the receipt of a TRGP-E/T award. For example, recipients\nwho have budgeted local funds to pay for a new computer system may not reallocate those funds to pay for\nany other law enforcement cost as a result of receiving TRGP-E/T funds for the same computer system. • Any training covered by TRGP-E/T funds is in addition to the number of hours of training already provided by\nyour agency. Funds currently allocated for training may not be reallocated to other purposes. Note: This award condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your agency\nunder this award. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any partner agencies use COPS Office funds only to\nsupplement, not supplant, their state, local, or BIA funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 36 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted nocost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays, or other\ncircumstances that interrupt the 36 month award funding period. An extension allows your agency to compensate\nfor such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding. Extension requests must be\nreceived prior to the end date of the award. 2 C.F.R. § 200.308(d)(2). Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the award end date. Requests\nto extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before the official award end date."

Extension\nrequests received after the expiration date will be considered only when the recipient provides justification of\nextraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance in which an unforeseen natural disaster\nprevented a recipient from requesting an extension. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension by the\nend date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. 39 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency’s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS Office\nTRGP Equipment/Training award. Award modifications under the program are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in\naccordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.308. For federal awards in excess of $250,000, any modification request involving\nthe reallocation of funding between budget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of\nthe total approved budget requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award\namount or budget modification percentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In\naddition, any budget modification that changes the scope of the project requires prior written approval by the COPS\nOffice. Furthermore, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that results in\nan increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may expend award funds only\nas approved in the FCM. Any requests to change or alter awards require written approval from the COPS Office\nprior to their implementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it\nwas originally awarded and accepted by your agency. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for\nunallowable costs (e.g., construction) will not be approved. Your agency may reprogram its budget up to an aggregate (over the course of your project) of 10 percent of the\ntotal project cost without prior written approval from the COPS Office. However, you should notify your COPS\nOffice Grant Program Specialist of any reprogramming that falls below the 10 percent threshold as well. For\nawards in excess of $250,000, any reprogramming of funds that totals an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the\napproved budget requires prior written approval from the COPS Office. What you should do: You are required to notify your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist if you determine that your agency will need\nto reprogram award funds. If your modification exceeds an aggregated (over the course of your project) 10 percent\nof your overall award, your agency must access https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. Please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist for further direction on any additional requirements that\nmay apply to your modification request. The COPS Office will then evaluate your request and notify your agency of\nour decision in writing."

Please note that modification approvals for active awards will be accompanied by a modified FCM\nreflecting the approved changes. 40 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of its award programs. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. 34 U.S.C. § 10385(b). Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may be\ncarried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may be improved, and why\ncertain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which your\nagency implements its TRGP award. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or evaluators may study the\neffectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the programs’\neffect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask questions about\nthe challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel about community policing, and\nhow police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other communities and police agencies across\nthe country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and\ninformation-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information about\nyour award activities. You should fully comply with any requests regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). 2 C.F.R §§ 200.327 –\n200.328. The progress report is used to track your agency’s progress toward implementing community policing\nstrategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency’s community policing capacity\nthrough COPS Office funding. The Federal Financial Report is used to track the expenditures of the recipient’s award\nfunds on a cumulative basis throughout the life of the award. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government must be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress of\nour programs and recipients. 41"

Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the “Account Access” tab on the COPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within\n30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the award\nperiod. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period, and the\nremaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw\ndown federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date, however you will have a 90-day grace\nperiod after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before\nthe award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic or financial report submission per\nfiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to\nreceive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in\nthe section titled “Reports” in this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid\nsuspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required reports\nmay also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both\naspects of award implementation—compliance and programmatic benefits—are part of the monitoring process\ncoordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include\nsite visits, enhanced office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic\nreporting, and audit resolution. As a COPS Office award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any\nrequests for information pertaining to your award. This includes all financial records, such as general accounting\nledgers and all supporting documents. All information pertinent to the implementation of the award is subject to\nagency review throughout the life of the award, during the close-out process and for three-years after the\nsubmission of the final expenditure report. 34 U.S.C. § 10385(a) and 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.333 & 200.336. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain a\nmonitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are complying with COPS Office award\nrequirements. In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance to help\nensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards. 42"

The four primary means of ensuring recipients’ compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to conduct\nsite visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is three-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions on how to prepare\nfor the review of their COPS Office awards. The site visit is generally performed over a period of one or\nmore days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while onsite, or if necessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will have an opportunity to seek\ncustomer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an EOBGR\nconducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative for\nconducting site visit reviews in support of the COPS Office’s overall award monitoring strategy. The purpose of\nthe EOBGR is three-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one to two day period. Compliance reviews will be conducted for\nactive awards to address any noncompliance and/or administrative issues identified during the review. In\naddition, award recipients will also receive customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a noncompliance\nissue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media,\ncitizens, law enforcement agencies, other federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case basis,\nCOPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints\nof alleged noncompliance."

This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the\nOIG. Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or non-violation based upon the supporting documentation\nand/or other factors used to make a determination for compliance or non-compliance. Audit Liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event\nyour agency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance and/or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with your\nagency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may include 43 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nrepayment of award funds and/or providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance and/or\nproviding proof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the causes for the\nnoncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award funds,\nor a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time. Under certain conditions, additional\nactions may include referral and placement on the US Department of Justice’s High Risk List, which will include\nmandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training and being subject to\nincreased monitoring of current and future awards while on the list. In the event of criminal misuse of award\nfunds, recipients may also be subject to fines and imprisonment. To avoid findings of noncompliance, recipients\nare strongly encouraged to become familiar with the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division’s Grant Monitoring\nStandards and Guidelines and with the Award Owner’s Manual for the year in which the award was made. Recipients should also contact the COPS Office or their Grant Program Specialist at any time during the life of a\nCOPS Office award with questions concerning award conditions, terms, or requirements to seek guidance to avoid\nnoncompliance. It is necessary for recipients to maintain all relevant documentation (administrative, financial, and\nprogrammatic) used to develop the application and implement the award that may be necessary or required to\ndemonstrate award compliance for a period of three-years from the date of submission of the final expenditure\nreport.

Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP)\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus Crime\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that established the COPS Office, that “the full\nand equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal justice\nsystem is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act’s program to reduce crime and delinquency in the United\nStates” 28 C.F.R. § 42.301. The Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) does not impose quotas or hiring\nrequirements on recipients of federal funds. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization’s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. 45 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual If your organization is a government agency or private business and has received a single award for $25,000 or\nmore and has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but excluding political\nappointees), then it has to prepare a Utilization Report and submit it to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within 120\ndays from the date of the award. Although the OCR has discretion to review all submitted Utilization Reports, it will\nreview the Utilization Reports from recipients that receive an award of $500,000 or more. To begin developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nhttps://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click EEOP Reporting Tool Login.

Reporting Frequency\nDuring any period of time when you are subject to the requirement in paragraph 1. of this award term\nand condition, you must report proceedings information through SAM for the most recent five year\nperiod, either to report new information about any proceeding(s) that you have not reported\npreviously or affirm that there is no new information to report. Recipients that have Federal contract,\naward, and cooperative agreement awards with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000\nmust disclose semiannually any information about the criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings. 5. Definitions\nFor purposes of this award term and condition:\na. Administrative proceeding means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to\nmake a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission\nAdministrative proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals proceedings, and Armed Services 58 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nBoard of Contract Appeals proceedings). This includes proceedings at the Federal and State level\nbut only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or award. It does not include\naudits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. b. Conviction, for purposes of this award term and condition, means a judgment or conviction of a\ncriminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or a plea,\nand includes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere. c.

Computer Network Requirement\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees that no award funds may be used to maintain or establish a computer\nnetwork unless such network blocks the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. Nothing in this\nrequirement limits the use of funds necessary for any federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any\nother entity carrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2018, Public Law 115-141, Division B, Title II, Section 531. Why this condition:\nSection 531 of Division B, Title II, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Pub. L. 115-141) prohibits the use\nof federal funds to maintain or establish a computer network that does not block the viewing, downloading, and\nexchanging of pornography. This provision protects the public interest in the proper management and use of\nfederal funds. 59 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual What you should do: The recipient must not use award funds to maintain or establish a computer network unless the network blocks\npornography. This does not limit the use of funds for criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. 26. Travel Costs\nCondition:\nTravel costs for transportation, lodging and subsistence, and related items are allowable under the TRGP\nEquipment/Training Program with prior approval from the COPS Office. Payment for allowable travel costs will be\nin accordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.474. Why this condition:\nTRGP-E/T will fund award-related travel costs for the recipient agency or other (nonrecipient) individuals to attend\ntraining and technical assistance conferences, seminars, or classes or to visit a site specified in the original\napplication. Allowable expenses for award-related lodging, meals, and incidental expenses that were included in\nthe application were approved by the COPS Office as part of your agency’s TRGP-E/T award and final budget. For\nmore information, please refer to award condition “Allowable Costs.” What you should do: Your agency should refer to your FCM for a list of approved travel costs and use TRGP-E/T funds only for those\napproved travel costs incurred during the award period. In addition, your agency should keep timely and accurate\nrecords of all travel expenses. If at any time these costs change, you should immediately contact your COPS Office\nGrant Program Specialist. 27. Contracts with Other Jurisdictions\nCondition:\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, and civilian positions awarded must be used for law enforcement\nactivities or services that benefit your agency and the population that it serves. The items funded under the TRGP\nEquipment/Training award cannot be utilized by other agencies unless the items benefit the population that your\nagency serves. Your agency may use items funded under the TRGP Equipment/Training award to assist other law\nenforcement agencies under a resource sharing, mutual aid, or other agreement to address multi-jurisdictional\nissues as described in the agreement.

      "content": "Your agency may use items funded under the TRGP Equipment/Training award to assist other law\nenforcement agencies under a resource sharing, mutual aid, or other agreement to address multi-jurisdictional\nissues as described in the agreement. Why this condition: The TRGP was created under a Congressional appropriation specifically designated for tribal law enforcement\nagencies to improve public safety in Indian communities. The TRGP-E/T award funding is intended to benefit the\ncommunities within the recipient’s primary law enforcement jurisdiction. Therefore, the recipient must use TRGP\naward funding to benefit its own population. 60 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual What you should do: Your law enforcement agency should avoid any agreements with other jurisdictions to share officer positions or\nother awarded equipment, technology, or vehicles, unless the agreement complies with the requirement that\nCOPS Office-funded items must benefit the recipient service population. For example, if your jurisdiction has both\na tribal police department and a BIA department, items funded under the award might be able to be used by the\nBIA department as long as this would result in a benefit to the population that you serve. You may not, however,\nallow officers, equipment, technology, or vehicles funded under the award to be utilized by any agency or\ntransferred to any agency that does not benefit the population that you serve. For example, you may not, during\nthe award term, loan two of your awarded computers to a neighboring county’s sheriff’s department. If your\nagency has an agreement with another law enforcement agency for resource sharing, mutual aid, etc. TRGP-E/T\nfunded items may be used to answer requests for assistance and assist in multi-jurisdictional activities as described\nin the agreement. Before you enter into any agreement with another law enforcement agency, you should contact your COPS Office\nGrant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770 for additional guidance. 28. Sole Source Justification\nCondition:\nRecipients who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group of items) or service in excess\nof $250,000 and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement process must provide a\nwritten sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating, expending, or drawing down\naward funds for that item or service. 2 C.F.R. § 200.324(b)(2). Why this condition: In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in some\ninstances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: If you have received an award for an item (or group of items) or service in excess of $250,000 and have already\ndetermined that the award of a contract through a competitive process is unfeasible, you must provide a written\njustification that explains why it is necessary to contract noncompetitively. The initial determination that competition is not feasible can be made if one of the following circumstances exists:\n•\n•\n•\n• Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. The COPS Office authorizes noncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the recipient. The item/service is available only from one source."

Public Release Information\nCondition: The recipient agrees to submit one copy of all reports and proposed publications resulting from this award ninety\n(90) days prior to public release. Any publications (written, curricula, visual, sound, report, or websites) or computer\nprograms, whether or not published at government expense, shall contain the following statement:\n“This project was supported, in whole or in part, by Cooperative Agreement Number 2017-XX-XX-XXXX\nawarded by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. The opinions\ncontained herein are those of the author(s) or contributor(s) and do not necessarily represent the official\nposition or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. References to specific individuals, agencies,\ncompanies, products, or services should not be considered an endorsement by the author(s),\ncontributor(s), or the U.S. Department of Justice. Rather, the references are illustrations to supplement\ndiscussion of the issues. The Internet references cited in this publication were valid as of the date of publication. Given that URLs\nand websites are in constant flux, neither the author(s) nor the COPS Office can vouch for their current\nvalidity.” Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office wants to ensure the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information in funded projects that\nare disseminated to the public.

Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using TRGP Equipment/Training funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must\ncomply with operating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. The recipient acknowledges that it has completed, signed,\nand submitted with its Federal award the relevant special condition certifying its compliance with 28 C.F.R. Part 23.\n62 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. An\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system which receives, stores, analyzes,\nand exchanges or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems that protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use TRGP award funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms of\ntechnology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not apply\nto this award. What you should do:\nAll COPS Office award recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence\nSystems/28 C.F.R. Part 23 as part of their award acceptance so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to\nuse their award funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use\naward funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should indicate this on the Criminal\nIntelligence Systems 28 C.F.R. Part 23 Compliance form that was included with your award package and certify and\nsubmit this form along with your signed award document as your agency’s agreement to comply with the\noperating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Your agency must now comply with 28 C.F.R. Part 23 in operating\nthe interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system funded through your COPS Office award. 31. Community policing\nCondition:\nCommunity policing activities to be initiated or enhanced by your agency were identified and described in your\ngrant application. All equipment, technology, training, and/or sworn officer positions awarded under the TRGP\naward must be linked to the implementation or enhancement of community policing.

(34 U.S.C. § 10382 (c)(10)) Why this condition: The COPS Office defines community policing as a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support\nthe systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the immediate\nconditions giving rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. TRGP-E/T awards\nmust be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities. All newly hired, additional, or rehired officers (or\nan equal number of redeployed veteran officers) funded under TRGP-E/T must engage in community policing\nactivities. While the COPS Office recognizes that your COPS Office-funded officer(s) (or an equal number of\nredeployed veteran officers) will participate in some or all aspects of your identified community policing plan and\nadvance your agency’s community policing activities over the life of the award, we also encourage your agency to\nmove toward an organization-wide philosophy and commitment to community policing. 63 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nCOPS Office awards are designed to increase community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This is\nachieved through problem-solving tactics and community policing partnerships. It enhances police professionalism\nby providing officers with the skills and motivation to act in innovative ways to solve community crime-related\nproblems. Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure that it is initiating or enhancing community\npolicing in accordance with your proposed plan, and that the officers hired (or an equal number of redeployed\nveteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance your agency’s community policing activities over the\nlife of the grant. The COPS Office may also use this information to understand the needs of the field, and\npotentially provide for training, technical assistance, problem solving, and community policing implementation\ntools. What you should do: The community policing activities designated for implementation or enhancement by your agency were identified\nin your award application. Your community policing needs may change during the life of your award, and minor\nchanges to this plan may be made without prior approval of the COPS Office. If your agency’s community policing\nplan changes significantly you must submit those changes in writing to the COPS Office for approval. Changes are\nsignificant if they deviate from the range of possible community policing activities identified and approved in the\noriginal community policing plan submitted with your application. What are the specific rules regarding termination of award funding? The COPS Office may suspend, in whole or in part, or terminate funding or impose other sanctions on a recipient\nfor the following reasons:\n• Failure to substantially comply with the requirements or objectives of the Public Safety Partnership and\nCommunity Policing Act of 1994, program guidelines, or other provisions of federal law\n• Failure to make satisfactory progress toward the goals or strategies set forth in this application\n• Failure to adhere to award agreement requirements or special conditions\n•"

Awards terminated due to noncompliance with the federal statutes, regulations, or award terms and conditions\nwill be reported to the integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS). False statements or claims made in connection with COPS Office awards may result in fines, imprisonment,\ndebarment from participating in federal awards or contracts, and any other remedy available by law.

Next, your financial institution must\ncomplete the “Financial Institution Information” section and have the appropriate financial official sign the form. If you are a recipient of a previous COPS Office award, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. You will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long as your bank account\ninformation and/or your OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your\nACH enrollment form information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak\nwith your state assigned Financial Analyst. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? Current regulations state that all COPS award recipients are required to submit their initial Federal Financial Report\n(FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) at the end of the period that includes the award start date, regardless of\nwhen the award was accepted, and thereafter, at the end of every calendar quarter, regardless of award activity. This report should reflect actual expenditures and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency on a\ncumulative basis. You will not be able to make drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 report for the\nmost recent reporting quarter is not on file with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Recipients are encouraged\nto submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete, and where to submit your quarterly SF-425 report, see the section of\nthis manual titled “Reporting Requirements.” 68 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nFiling the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of “minimum cash on hand” applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances.

How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements; however, your reimbursement\nrequests should cover a specific time frame and include only costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM). As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once. Can we earn interest on our award funds? For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified at 31\nC.F.R. Part 205 ‘‘Rules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers’’ and TFM 4A–2000 Overall\nDisbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies. For non-federal entities other than states, payment methods must minimize the time between your drawdown of\nfederal funds and your payment of award costs to avoid earning excess interest on your award funds. You must\naccount for interest earned on advances of federal funds as follows:\n• The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance at 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(9) states that\ninterest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year\nmay be retained by the non-federal entity for administrative expenses. • Any interest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts that is in excess of\n$500 per year must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment\nManagement System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nnetwork or a Fedwire Funds Service payment. For detailed information on remittance, please see the\nappendices for a full text of the electronic medium remittance options. 69 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\n• If you do not have access to an electronic medium option, then please make a check payable to “The\nDepartment of Health and Human Services” and mail the check to Treasury-approved lockbox: HHS Program\nSupport Center, P.O.

Financial Record Maintenance As an award recipient of this COPS Office award program, your agency is required to establish and maintain\naccounting systems and financial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records\nmust include both federal funds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for\nthe funds awarded. As required by 2 C.F.R. § 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your\naccounting system should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the\nfollowing objectives for federal awards:\n• Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. • Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. • Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency’s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity of your COPS Office awards. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with each COPS Office award (including payroll, time\nand attendance records, canceled checks, and purchase order) must be retained for a period of three years from\nthe date of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 C.F.R. § 200.333 (Retention requirements for\nrecords). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever you\nfind more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving these records has been\nstarted before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These\nrecords should be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to\nmaintain adequate records to document award expenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds\nthat cannot be supported with appropriate records. 71 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual"

If your agency has more than one COPS Office award or an award from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization from the\nCOPS Office, or in the case of an award from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your accounting\nsystems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Comptroller\nGeneral of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may access these\nrecords for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 72 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual V. Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The\ntwo primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving federal\nfinancial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on June 26,\n2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and reporting\nrequirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 C.F.R. Part 200—Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) on\nDecember 26, 2013. This guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments awarded on or after\nDecember 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of SAA requirements. 2\nC.F.R. Part 200, Subpart F – Audit Requirements, available at www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl, establishes the requirements for organizational audits that\napply to COPS Office award recipients. Recipients must arrange for the required organization-wide (not award-byaward) audit in accordance with the requirements of Subpart F. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. §200.514 Scope of audit except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. §200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987 to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit is\nto express opinions on the recipient’s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations."

Single Audits may also address specific\ncompliance issues with respect to COPS Office award requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, federal\nagencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in 2 C.F.R. §200.338 - Remedies for\nnoncompliance. See 2 C.F.R. §200.505. These sanctions under 2 C.F.R. §200.338 could include the following:\n• Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or more\nsevere enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. • Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the\nactivity or action not in compliance. • Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the federal award. 73 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\n• Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 C.F.R. part 180 and federal awarding\nagency regulations (or in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding be initiated by a\nfederal awarding agency). • Withhold further federal awards for the project or program.\n• Take other remedies that may be legally available.

If the DOJ is your cognizant federal agency (see the\nGlossary of Terms in the appendices), they should be sent to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse at:\nFederal Audit Clearinghouse\nBureau of Census\n1201 East 10th Street\nJeffersonville, IN 47132\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) serves as the liaison between recipients and\nauditors in the conduct of resolving and closing SAA audits. Questions and comments regarding SAA audits may be\ndirected to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the OIG for award audits? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits are\ndesigned to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on an\nannual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the\nOIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the geographical distribution of\nawards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and expired), and type of award (hiring\nand non-hiring)."

The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division’s Audit Liaison Section serves as the liaison between recipients and the\nOIG’s Audit Division, which conducts the audit. The OIG steps in the audit process will determine the interactions\nbetween the OIG, the recipient, and the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section:\n• Call for award data. The OIG requests award documentation from the COPS Office. • Entrance conference. The OIG schedules to meet with the recipient to gather documentation and conduct\naudit. 74 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\n• Draft audit report. The OIG reviews documentation and presents initial findings to the recipient and copies\nthe COPS Office. The COPS Office interacts with the recipient to coordinate any repayments, and/or policy or\nprocedure documents to be submitted to the OIG before release of the Final Audit Report. • Final audit report. The OIG has completed its direct interaction with the recipient. The COPS Office directs\nthe recipient to formulate a Corrective Action Plan to address recommendations (findings). As each\nrecommendation is successfully addressed by the recipient, the COPS Office requests closure on the\nrecommendation. • Closing the audit. When all recommendations have been closed, the COPS Office requests closure on the\naudit from the OIG and notifies the recipient that the audit is closed. If you have any questions regarding an OIG audit, please contact the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division’s Audit\nLiaison Section via the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. Questions and comments regarding the\nadministration of your COPS Office TRGP award, not specifically related to an audit, should be referred to your\nCOPS Office Grant Program Specialist. Typical audit findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to awards as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems:\n• Unallowable costs. Recipient incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget or a budget\nmodification, were in excess of the approved budget, or were charged to the award after the expiration date\nand an award extension was not obtained. • Unsupported costs. Specific award expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by adequate\ndocumentation (including but not limited to receipts or purchases orders), that may have been allowable\nunder the program, but for which no prior written approval was obtained from the COPS Office , or award\nexpenditures were in excess of actual approved award costs. • Lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting.

Reporting Requirements As a COPS Office award recipient, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as\nwell as quarterly Programmatic Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report COPS\nOffice award funding separately from all other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal awards) to\nensure accurate financial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have\nadequate financial internal controls in place to monitor the use of all funding, and also to ensure that its use is\nconsistent with the award terms and conditions. Good stewardship in this area includes written accounting\npractices, use of an accounting system that adequately tracks all award drawdowns and expenditures, and has the\nability to track when COPS Office award–funded positions are filled or approved purchases are made. Failure to\nsubmit complete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result in the suspension and possible termination\nof your agency’s COPS Office award funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit a quarterly Federal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter.

When the Award Period Has Ended At the end of your agency’s COPS Office award period, the COPS Office is responsible for the closeout of your\naward. As part of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation demonstrating that your agency has met\nall of the programmatic and financial requirements of the award. After the end of the award period, your agency\nwill be asked to submit a Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) and any applicable final programmatic progress\nreports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final Federal Financial Report FFR (SF-425) for your award is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after\nthe end date of the award period. To avoid being delinquent and having your funds frozen, you must submit an SF425 report within the 30 day grace period, even if your final SF-425 is not due yet. You can revise that report to\nreflect your final actual costs and revise the status as final no later than 90 days after the end date of the award\nperiod. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal expenditures that were incurred\nduring the life of the award, as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. The federal funds\nexpended should reflect only the actual allowable costs incurred relative to the specific TRGP program\nrequirements for that award. In addition, once you have completed your final drawdown, this report should\nreconcile with the total amount of federal funds drawn down by your agency. The final SF-425 should also include\nthe total amount of the local cash match contributed, if applicable When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent, and expenses incurred but not yet paid, for any approved items listed on the FCM. Your\nagency has up to 90 days after the end date of the award period to pay for eligible expenses previously incurred,\nand to request reimbursement for any remaining eligible balance. You cannot list an accrual on your final SF-425. Request an extension if you will not be able to pay for any obligations within the time frames listed above. Please be advised that 2 C.F.R. Part 200.343(a) requires recipients to submit final SF-425s and 2 C.F.R. Part\n200.343(b) requires recipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the\nexpiration of the award. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day\nperiod following award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance."

Community Policing Defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of\npartnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to\npublic safety issues such as violent crime, nonviolent crime, and fear of crime. Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1.\nCommunity partnerships\n2. Organizational transformation 3. Problem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the individuals\nand organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages interactive\npartnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these partnerships can be\nused to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through collaborative problem\nsolving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and addressing public safety\nproblems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify community\nconcerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies, prosecutors, probation\nand parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies, health and human\nservices departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community—volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters—are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific goals at\ntown hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the community,\nand team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its behalf\ncan be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share common\ninterests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups, advocacy\ngroups, community development corporations, and the faith community. 92 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Institutions of Higher Education\nInstitutions of higher education create communities of students, professors, and personnel that are important\nstakeholders. The institutions can also provide resources to law enforcement agencies by assisting with\ncommunication strategies, facilitation of community meetings, data analysis, and research. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because they\noften bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify\nproblems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and community\noutreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating information about\npolice and business partnerships and initiatives, and crime prevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community agencies\nor new laws or codes that will be enforced."

They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community agencies\nor new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on public\nperceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how the\ninfrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages the\napplication of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the entire\ndepartment, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem solving\nand partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and communication that\ntake place within agencies to support this orientation. 93 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nLeadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing, and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing’s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of doing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part of\nthe process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor groups\nin agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing implementation. Decision making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision making. Decentralized\ndecision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision making\ninvolves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving efforts, and\nallowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various\nresources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community\nwill help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise."

      "content": "Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan is to\nhave value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their\nefforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization’s mission and values statement should be\nsimple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures,\nwhere appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime rates)\ncommunity policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include such things as greater\ncommunity satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation—one that looks at not only how\noutcomes are measured, but also at how feedback information is used. 94 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nTransparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the\ncommunity is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant information on\ncrime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local patrol officers have decisionmaking authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term assignments, the\ndevelopment of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or\nareas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance customer service and facilitate more contact between\npolice and the community, thus establishing a strong relationships and mutual accountability. Patrol beat\nboundaries should be aligned to neighborhood boundaries to enhance officers’ understanding of communities\nwithin their patrol areas and to build trust within the community. Other community policing partners should\nbecome familiar with both the patrol officers and community policing officers assigned within each patrol beat to\ncoordinate government and nongovernment community policing activities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers have to be able to handle multiple responsibilities and take a team\napproach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the community. Community policing encourages its\nadoption agency-wide, not just by special units, although there may be a need for specialist units that are tasked\nwith identifying and solving particularly complex problems or managing complex partnerships. Resources (time, finances, and people) Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources and the investment of time to support\ncommunity policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained and\neffective.

Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency\nincluding recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from sworn officers to\ncivilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be aligned with the agencies’\ncommunity policing views. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment, selection,\nand hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving responsibilities\nand encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service instead of only a spirit of adventure. A 95 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\ncommunity policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it looks for recruits, whom it is recruiting and\nhiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community involvement in this process\nthrough the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations\nSupervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are incorporated\ninto job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional procedures should support sound problem-solving\nactivities, proactive policing, community collaboration, and community satisfaction with police services. Training\nTraining at all levels—academy, field, and in-service—must support community policing principles and tactics. It\nalso needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to identify and\ncorrect conditions that could lead to crime, raise public awareness, and engage the community in finding solutions\nto problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving and help\nofficers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized within the\norganization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information technology systems\nCommunity policing is highly information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in providing ready access to\nquality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective and ensures\nthat officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their patrol beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with accessing information to provide vital resources, improving\ntwo-way communication with community members, and developing agency accountability systems and\nperformance outcome measures. Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the public and\ninternally within their organization. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages agencies to\ndevelop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports; reverse 911; email\nalerts; Internet social media discussion forums; and feedback on interactive applications (such as surveys and\ngeographical information), thereby creating open, ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters, email and\nenhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other entities for more\nefficient operations."

Community policing also encourages the use of technology to develop accountability and\nperformance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a broad array of measures\nand information. Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely information\non crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers in their patrol cars or\nthrough personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem analysis functions by enabling\nagencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime locations, and quality-of-life\nconcerns, and to further enhance analysis. 96 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual\nQuality and accuracy of data\nInformation is only as good as its source; therefore, it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information from various\nsources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked to one another and\nchecked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance\nmeasurement. Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions\nto the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused\ninto all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about\ntheir responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A major conceptual\nvehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way is the SARA\n(scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the\nscope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the\nselected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents similar\nin one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a\nplace, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from\nthe community, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding of\nthe dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish correlation,\nand develop an understanding of cause and effect."

The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding of\nthe dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish correlation,\nand develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to find out as much\nas possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?, when?, where?, how?, why?, and why\nnot? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an identified\nproblem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response should follow\nlogically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific problem. The goals\nof the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially reducing the problem or\nreducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of community cohesion. 97 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but also\ngathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process, outcomes,\nor both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis should be\nreviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and tested. The\nentire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear, meaning that additional scanning, analysis, or\nresponses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim, offender,\nand location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for example, capable\nguardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders (e.g., parents, friends,\nand probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees, and motel clerks). Rather\nthan focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the police focus on the factors that are within\ntheir reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating\nrisk with unwanted behavior.

At present, an officer may select a garment that corresponds\nto an appropriate threat level and be confident that armor in compliance with NIJ’s standard will defeat\nthe stated threat level.” Type I (.22 LR; .38 Special) Type I body armor is light. This is the minimum level of protection every officer should have, and the armor should\nbe routinely worn at all times while on duty. Type I body armor was the armor issued during the NIJ demonstration\nproject in the mid-1970s. Most agencies today, however, because of increasing threats, opt for a higher level of\nprotection. This armor protects against .22 long rifle high-velocity lead bullets, with nominal masses of 2.6 g (40 gr), impacting\nat a velocity of 320 m/s (1,050 ft/s) or less, and against .38 special round-nose lead bullets, with nominal masses of\n10.2 g (158 gr), impacting at a velocity of 259 m/s (850 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against most other\n.25 and .32 caliber handgun rounds. Type II-A (lower velocity .357 Magnum; 9mm)\nType II-A body armor is well suited for full-time use by police departments, particularly those seeking protection\nfor their officers from lower velocity .357 Magnum and 9mm ammunition. This armor protects against .357 Magnum jacketed soft-point bullets, with nominal masses of 10.2 g (158 gr),\nimpacting at a velocity of 381 m/s (1,250 ft/s) or less, and against 9mm full-metal jacketed bullets, with nominal\nmasses of 8.0 g (124 gr), impacting at a velocity of 332 m/s (1,175 ft/s). It also protects against such threats as .45\nauto., .38 special +P, and some other factory loads in caliber .357 Magnum and 9mm as well as the Type I threats. Type II (higher velocity .357 Magnum; 9mm)\nType II body armor is heavier and bulkier than either Types I or II-A. It is worn full-time by officers seeking\nprotection against higher velocity .357 Magnum and 9mm ammunition. 99 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual This armor protects against .357 Magnum jacketed soft-point bullets, with nominal masses of 10.2 g (158 gr),\nimpacting at a velocity of 425 m/s (1,395 ft/s) or less, and against 9mm full-jacketed bullets, with nominal\nvelocities of 358 m/s (1,175 ft/s).

Type III-A (.44 Magnum; submachine gun 9mm) Type III-A body armor provides the highest level of protection currently available from concealable body armor and\nis generally suitable for routine wear in many situations. However, departments located in hot, humid climates\nmay need to evaluate the use of Type III-A armor carefully. This armor protects against .44 Magnum lead semi-wadcutter bullets with gas checks, nominal masses of 15.55 g\n(240 gr), impacting at a velocity of 426 m/s (1,400 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against most handgun\nthreats as well as the Type I, II-A, and II threats. Type III (high-powered rifle) Type III body armor is clearly intended only for tactical situations when the threat warrants such protection, such\nas barricade confrontations involving sporting rifles. This armor, normally of hard or semi-rigid construction, protects against 7.62 mm full-metal jacketed bullets (U.S.\nmilitary designation M80), with nominal masses of 9.7 g (150 gr), impacting at a velocity of 838 m/s (2,750 ft/s) or\nless. It also provides protection against threats such as 223 Remington (5.56 mm FMJ), 30 Carbine FMJ, and 12gauge rifled slug, as well as the Type I through III-A threats. Type IV (armor-piercing rifle) Type IV body armor provides the highest level of protection currently available. Because this armor is intended to\nresist armor piercing bullets, it often uses ceramic materials. Such materials are brittle in nature and may provide\nonly single-shot protection, since the ceramic tends to break up when struck. As with Type III armor, Type IV armor\nis clearly intended only for tactical situations when the threats warrant such protection. This armor protects against .30-06 caliber armor-piercing bullets (U.S. military designation AMP2), with nominal\nmasses of 10.8 g (166 gr), impacting at a velocity of 868 m/s (2,850 ft/s) or less.
