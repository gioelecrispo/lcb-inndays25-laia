Community policing defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of\npartnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to\npublic safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1.\n2.\n3. Community partnerships\nOrganizational transformation\nProblem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the individuals\nand organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages interactive\npartnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these partnerships can be\nused to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through collaborative problem\nsolving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and addressing public safety\nproblems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify community\nconcerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies, prosecutors, probation\nand parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies, health and human\nservices departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community—volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters—are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns."
