  "chunk_text": "EOBGRs serve as an alternative for\nconducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office’s overall award monitoring strategy. The\npurpose of the EOBGR is threefold:\n1.\n2.\n3. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review the recipient’s community policing strategies To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Recipients will have an opportunity to\nresolve any identified noncompliance issues, if necessary, following the EOBGR interview. In addition,\naward recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that originates\nfrom an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs\ngenerally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance Division, or the COPS\nOffice Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a noncompliance issue to the ANCR. External\nnoncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media, citizens, law enforcement\nagencies, other Federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office ANCR staff\nmembers determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the OIG. Each ANCR referral is\nresolved as a violation or nonviolation based upon the preponderance of the supporting documentation or other\nfacts to determine if the award recipient is in compliance or noncompliance. Audit liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event your\nagency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from noncompliance\nor poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with your agency to resolve and\nclose these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may include repayment of award funds,\nproviding adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance, or providing proof of policies or procedures that\nwere created or revised to directly address the causes for the noncompliance as a proactive preventative measure\nto avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award funds,\nor a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time."
