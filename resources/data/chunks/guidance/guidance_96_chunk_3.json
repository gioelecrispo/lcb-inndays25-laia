If this\ninformation is incorrect or has changed, please update your agency contacts online at\nhttps://portal.cops.usdoj.gov through the “Account Access” link. If the law enforcement or government official\nhas changed since the time of application, please have the current law enforcement executive or government\nexecutive for your agency create an account through the “Account Access” link, log in, and sign the award\ndocument once your agency contacts have been updated online. Once you have reviewed your award document,\nplease electronically sign it and make a copy of all pages of the document for your records, along with all award\ncondition pages, within 90 days of the date shown on the award congratulatory letter. Please see “Accepting the\naward” in this manual. The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed for any\nallowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your AHTF award is two years (24 months). Your award number is in the following format: 2017-HPWX-0000 for awards funded in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. The\nCOPS Office tracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency’s\naward number (or your agency’s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI, the COPS Office assigns a\nnonofficial ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two characters will be “ZZ”). If you have\nany questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your agency’s ORI number when you\ncontact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency’s nine- or thirteendigit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP vendor\nnumber differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for administrative\npurposes in connection with this program, and should not be used for IRS purposes. 2 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual Award terms and conditions The award terms and conditions are listed on your agency’s award document. By accepting this award, you are\nobtaining federal funds from the COPS Office. As part of that agreement, your agency acknowledges that it will\ncomply with the terms and conditions (and, if applicable, additional special or high risk conditions specific to your\nagency). The section that follows describes in detail all of the award conditions, their rationales, and their\nimplications. It also addresses many frequently asked questions."
