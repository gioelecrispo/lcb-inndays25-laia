Funds currently allocated to purchase equipment or technology may not be\nreallocated to other purposes or reimbursed upon the receipt of a TRGP-E/T award. For example, recipients\nwho have budgeted local funds to pay for a new computer system may not reallocate those funds to pay for\nany other law enforcement cost as a result of receiving TRGP-E/T funds for the same computer system. • Any training covered by TRGP-E/T funds is in addition to the number of hours of training already provided by\nyour agency. Funds currently allocated for training may not be reallocated to other purposes. Note: This award condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your agency\nunder this award. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any partner agencies use COPS Office funds only to\nsupplement, not supplant, their state, local, or BIA funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 36 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted nocost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays, or other\ncircumstances that interrupt the 36 month award funding period. An extension allows your agency to compensate\nfor such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding. Extension requests must be\nreceived prior to the end date of the award. 2 C.F.R. § 200.308(d)(2). Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the award end date. Requests\nto extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before the official award end date."
