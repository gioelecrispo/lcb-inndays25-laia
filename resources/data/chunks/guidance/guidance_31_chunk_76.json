  "chunk_text": "You are required to submit an SF-425 even if you have not spent\nany money or incurred any costs during a reporting period. The due dates for online filing of SF-425 reports are\nthe same as for the submission of paper copies. Example: If your award start date is 09-01-18 and the current date is 11-15-18, then your first SF-425 would be due no later\nthan 10-30-18 and would cover the period 09-01-18 (award start date) through 09-30-18 (end of the initial\nreporting quarter for this award). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office before the submission deadline\nso that you can avoid being delinquent and successfully complete a drawdown of funds through GPRS. Award recipients who do not submit an SF-425 report by the due date each quarter will be unable to draw down\nfunds. The payment system contains a function which checks for SF-425 delinquency and will reject a drawdown\nattempt if the SF-425 is not current. Subsequent outreach through e-mail, fax, or hard copy reminders may be sent\nto the recipient if the SF-425 is delinquent. For general information concerning online filing of SF-425 reports, go to www.cops.usdoj.gov or contact the COPS\nOffice Response Center by phone at 800-421-6770 or by e-mail at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov.
