Receives a subaward from you under this award; and\nb. Is accountable to you for the use of the Federal funds provided by the subaward. Why this condition: The purpose of this standard award term is to ensure government-wide uniformity in establishing the DUNS\nnumber as the universal identifier for federal financial assistance applicants, as well as recipients and their direct\nsubrecipients (if applicable), and to establish the SAM as the repository for standard information about applicants\nand recipients. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was required to provide its DUNS number and be registered in the\nSAM database. Your agency should continue to use the same DUNS number provided in your award application and update, as\nneeded, the information associated with that DUNS number. If your agency is authorized to make subawards\nunder its award, your agency may make subawards only to entities that have DUNS numbers. For more\ninformation about your DUNS number, please contact D&B using the toll-free number 866-705-5711 or visit\nhttp://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. Your agency must maintain active registration and current information in the SAM until you submit the final\nfinancial report or receive the final payment under your award, whichever is later. Your agency must review and\nupdate its SAM information at least once per year to maintain an active registration status. For more\ninformation about SAM registration, please visit www.sam.gov. 18 2017 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Ownerâ€™s Manual 16.
