In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress of our\nprograms and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with CAMP\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the “Account Access” tab of the COPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within\n30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the award\nperiod. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period and the\nremaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw\ndown federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however you will have a 90 day grace\nperiod after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before\nthe award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic and/or financial report submission\nper fiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses, and may be required\nto receive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail\nin the section titled “Reports,” in this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid\nsuspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required reports\nmay also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Award monitoring activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both\naspects of award implementation—compliance and programmatic benefits—are part of the monitoring process\ncoordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include\nsite visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and\naudit resolution. As a COPS Office award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests for\ninformation pertaining to your award. This includes all financial records, such as general accounting ledgers and all\nsupporting documents. All information pertinent to the implementation of the award is subject to agency review\nthroughout the life of the award, during the close-out process and for three-years after the submission of the final\nexpenditure report. 34 U.S.C. § 10385(a) and 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.333 & 200.336."
