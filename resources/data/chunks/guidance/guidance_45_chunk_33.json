Public Release Information\nCondition: The recipient agrees to submit one copy of all reports and proposed publications resulting from this award ninety\n(90) days prior to public release. Any publications (written, curricula, visual, sound, reports, or websites) or\ncomputer programs, whether or not published at government expense, shall contain the following statement:\n“This project was supported, in whole or in part, by federal award number 2019-XX-XX-XXXX awarded to\n[entity] by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. The opinions\ncontained herein are those of the author(s) or contributor(s) and do not necessarily represent the official\nposition or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. References to specific individuals, agencies,\ncompanies, products, or services should not be considered an endorsement by the author(s) or the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice. Rather, the references are illustrations to supplement discussion of the issues. The internet references cited in this publication were valid as of the date of publication. Given that URLs\nand websites are in constant flux, neither the author(s) nor the COPS Office can vouch for their current\nvalidity.” Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office wants to ensure the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information in funded projects that\nare disseminated to the public. However, award-funded reports and publications are not works of authorship by\nthe Federal Government and should not be construed to reflect the official policy or position of the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice. What you should do:\nEnsure that all publications developed under your award contain the required statement listed above. 29. Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using award funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with the\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. By signing the Reviews and Certifications in the application, the recipient\nassured the COPS Office that it will comply with the requirements of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found in 28 C.F.R. Part 23. An\n“interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system” is generally defined as a system that receives, stores, analyzes,\nexchanges, or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal information systems that protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. 33 2019 COPS Office Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act (LEMHWA) Program Award Owner’s Manual If your agency will use award funds to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms of technology)\nand will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not apply to your\naward."
