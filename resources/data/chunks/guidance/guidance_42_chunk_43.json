Specific award expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by adequate\ndocumentation (including but not limited to receipts or purchases orders), that may have been allowable\nunder the program, but for which no prior written approval was obtained from the COPS Office , or award\nexpenditures were in excess of actual approved award costs.  Lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Recipient failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems.  Funds to better use. Funds could be used more efficiently based on management actions such as reductions\nin outlays; deobligation of funds; withdrawal; costs not incurred by implementing recommended\nimprovements; and any other identified savings.  Questioned costs. Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted from a\nviolation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, award terms and conditions, or other\ndocument governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable and do not\nreflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because costs at the time\nof the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. 46 2019 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual  Policy and procedure.

The recipient is required to develop or revise policies and/or procedures\nconsistent with their existing practices and submit to the COPS Office to forward to the OIG to close the\nrecommendation.  Supplanting. Recipient could not document efforts to backfill vacant local sworn officer positions, or recipient\ncould not explain reductions in local law enforcement budget or in sworn officer positions during the award\nperiod. After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division will continue working\nas the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The COPS Office will issue\na closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must keep all documentation\nrelated to the audit for a period of three years following the audit’s closure. 47 2019 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual VI. Reporting Requirements As part of CAMP, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as quarterly\nProgrammatic Progress Reports.
