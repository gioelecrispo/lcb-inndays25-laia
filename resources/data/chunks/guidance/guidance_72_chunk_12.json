If your modification exceeds an aggregated (over the course of your project) 10 percent\nof your overall award, your agency must access https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. Please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist for further direction on any additional requirements that\nmay apply to your modification request. The COPS Office will then evaluate your request and notify your agency of\nour decision in writing. Implementation of the modified award budget may begin following written approval from\nthe COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for active awards will be accompanied by a modified FCM\nreflecting the approved changes. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of its award programs. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. 34 U.S.C. § 10385(b). Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may be\ncarried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine what programs are working, how programs may be improved, and why\ncertain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which your\nagency implements its CAMP award. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or evaluators may study the\neffectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the programs’\neffect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask questions about\nthe challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel about community policing, and\nhow police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other communities and police agencies across\nthe country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your department, observe activities, and obtain written\nreports about and from your department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and information-gathering\nactivities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information about your award activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 11 2019 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). 2 C.F.R §§ 200.327 –\n200.328. The progress report is used to track your agency’s progress toward implementing community policing\nstrategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency’s community policing capacity\nthrough COPS Office funding. The Federal Financial Report is used to track the expenditures of the recipient’s award\nfunds on a cumulative basis throughout the life of the award."
