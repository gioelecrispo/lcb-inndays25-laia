  "chunk_text": "What you should do:\nPlease read the entire AHTF Award Owner’s Manual carefully prior to signing the award document. If you have any\nquestions, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. When accepting your award, you should\nensure that the proper reporting and financial systems are in place to satisfy the award requirements. 2. Assurances and Certifications\nCondition: The recipient acknowledges its agreement to comply with the Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed\nas part of its application. Why this condition:\nAlthough the COPS Office has made every effort to simplify the process of applying for and receiving awards,\nseveral provisions of federal law require us to obtain the recipient’s signed Assurances and Certifications regarding\ncertain matters. Most of the Assurances and Certifications apply to all federal award programs. What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS Office award programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at the time\nof application and application update. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have read,\nunderstood, and accepted the award terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications. Please\nread these documents carefully, because signatures on these documents are treated as a material representation\nof fact upon which reliance was placed when the US Department of Justice determined whether to fund the\ncovered award. Additional copies of the Assurances and Certifications forms are contained in the appendices of\nthis manual. If you have any questions about them, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist via\nthe COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. 3. Allowable Costs\nCondition: The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs for activities related to the establishment and\nenhancement of a variety of problem-solving strategies to investigate heroin and other opioid problems in your\njurisdiction. The allowable costs for which your agency’s award has been approved are limited to those listed on the\n4 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which is included in your agency’s award package. The Financial\nClearance Memorandum FCM specifies the costs that your agency is allowed to fund with your AHTF award, and\nspecifies the overall amount approved for each budget request category. Your agency may not use AHTF award\nfunds for any costs that are not identified as allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual\nallowable costs incurred during the award period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown. If your agency\nexperiences any cost savings over the course of the award (for example, your award application overestimated the\ntotal entry-level officer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use that excess funding to extend\nthe length of the award beyond 24 months. Any funds remaining after your agency has drawn down for the costs\napproved during the 24 month funding period will be deobligated during the closeout process, and should not be\nspent by your agency. Why this condition: The funding under this project is for the purchase of items and services approved by the COPS Office as reflected in\nthe Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM)."
