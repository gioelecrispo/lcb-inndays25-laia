  "chunk_text": "If your agency will use AHTF program funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms\nof technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not\napply to this award. What you should do:\nAll AHTF recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence Systems/28 C.F.R. Part 23 as part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to use their award\nfunds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use award funds to\noperate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should have indicated this in your application and\ncertified your agency’s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Your agency\nnow must comply with 28 C.F.R. Part 23 in operating the inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system funded\nthrough your AHTF award. 29. Sole Source Justification\nCondition:\nRecipients who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group of items) or service in excess\nof $250,000 and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement process must provide a\nwritten sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating, expending, or drawing down\naward funds for that item or service. 2 C.F.R. § 200.324(b)(2). Why this condition: In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in some\ninstances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: If you have received an award for an item (or group of items) or service in excess of $250,000 and have already\ndetermined that the award of a contract through a competitive process is unfeasible, you must provide a written\njustification that explains why it is necessary to contract noncompetitively. The initial determination that competition is not feasible can be made if one of the following circumstances exists:\n•\n•\n•\n• Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. The COPS Office authorizes noncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the recipient. The item/service is available only from one source. The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive\nsolicitation. 34 2018 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual The COPS Office will review your request and the supporting information that you provide and will make a\ndetermination as to whether or not an exception can be made to the general rule regarding competition. If\nsubmitting a sole source justification request to the COPS Office, please use the format described in the “Sole\nSource Justification fact sheet” in appendices of this manual. 30. Law Enforcement Information Sharing\nCondition:\nRecipients agree to share relevant law enforcement information collected as a result of AHTF funding with the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Fusion Center. Why this condition: The AHTF award is intended to assist states in tackling their heroin and opioid challenges."
