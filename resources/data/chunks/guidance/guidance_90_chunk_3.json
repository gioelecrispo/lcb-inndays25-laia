The award start date indicated on the award document means that your organization may be reimbursed for any\nallowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your CRI-TA award is listed on your award document. Your award number is in the following format: 2017-CRXX-XXXX for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 awards. The COPS Office\ntracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have your organization’s award\nnumber (or your organization’s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating organization identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers\nor letters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If your organization does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI, the COPS Office\nassigns a nonofficial ORI code to use as an organization identifier (in such cases, the last two characters will be\n“ZZ”). If you have any questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your organization’s\nORI number when you contact the COPS Office. 2 Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your organization’s nine- or\nthirteen-digit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP\nvendor number differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for\nadministrative purposes in connection with this program, and should not be used for IRS purposes. Award terms and conditions The award terms and conditions are listed on your organization’s award document. By accepting this award, you\nare obtaining federal funds from the COPS Office. As part of that agreement, your organization acknowledges that\nit will comply with these terms and conditions (and, if applicable, any additional special or high risk conditions\nspecific to your organization). The section that follows describes, in detail, all of the award conditions, their\nrationales, and their implications. It also addresses many frequently asked questions. If you have additional\nquestions concerning any of these award conditions, please contact your COPS Office Program Manager or call the\nCOPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. In limited circumstances, your award may be subject to special conditions that prevent your organization from\ndrawing down or accessing award funds until the special conditions are satisfied as determined by the COPS Office. Any special or high risk conditions will be included in the award document supplement. However, if you have\nquestions about the special or high risk conditions, please contact your assigned COPS Office Program Manager. Reasons for award terms and conditions"
