  "chunk_text": "6. Once an event is approved, how do we handle any increases or decreases in the amount of attendees\noriginally proposed on the cost analysis spreadsheet submitted to the DOJ for approval? After receiving notiﬁcation of approval from the COPS Office, all subsequent changes prior to the start day of\nthe event should be sent to the COPS Oﬃce Conference Costs email address, as appropriate. Example: If the\nCOPS Office approved on 9/1/2017 an event scheduled for 12/15/2017, the cooperative agreement recipient\nor contractor should notify the COPS Office of any changes in attendees as soon as possible (preferably 30\ndays or more in advance). This scenario holds true for changes to the start and end date, location, and any\nother cost-related category. 7. Does the $25 per person per day limit for meeting rooms and audio-visual costs also include service fees and\ntaxes? Yes. The cost allowed for conference space and audio-visual equipment and services (fees and taxes) is limited\nto $25 per day per attendee and is not to exceed a cumulative total cost of $20,000. Total costs are deﬁned as\ndirect and indirect costs. 85 8. What if there are multiple meetings occurring within the larger event oﬀered to all the attendees? Is the\n$25 per day per attendee limit applicable to each meeting? Example: A general session meeting contains all\nattendees and later breakout sessions are oﬀered to the groups. Can each breakout session have its own\n$25 per person per day limit? No. Despite the multiple meetings oﬀered within the larger event, the COPS Office considers and approves\nthis type of situation to be a single event. 9. Can we accept complimentary food and beverage? Yes. Complimentary food and beverages may be accepted if oﬀered to everyone. Example: Hotel W oﬀers a\ncomplimentary continental breakfast to all its overnight customers regardless of any status they may have\nwith the hotel chain. This type of complimentary oﬀer is considered a business strategy of the hotel to\npromote an increase in overnight stays. You are not required to reduce your M&IE by the value of the food\nand beverage it oﬀered to all customers as noted in this example. 10. Are the thresholds ($8,750 for logistical planner, $35,000 for programmatic planner, and $20,000 for\nconference space and audio-visual equipment and services) a cumulative cost for the entire event or a per\nday cost? The cost allowed for conference space and audio-visual equipment and services (fees and taxes) is limited to\n$25 per day per attendee and is not to exceed a cumulative total cost of $20,000. The cost allowed for a\nlogistical planner is the lesser of $50 per attendee or $8,750 per event. The cost allowed for a programmatic\nplanner is the lesser of $200 per attendee or $35,000 per event. 11. To whom should I submit event requests? For all COPS Oﬃce events, the form should be sent to the COPS Office Conference Costs email address. Please\ndo not send questions or other correspondence to this email address. This mailbox should be used only for the\nsubmission of conference forms and supporting documentation (e.g., hotel contracts). 12."
