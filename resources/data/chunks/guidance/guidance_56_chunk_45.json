  "chunk_text": "You are required to submit an\nSF-425 even if you have not spent any money or incurred any costs during a reporting period. The due dates for\nonline filing of SF-425s are the same as for the submission of paper copies. Example: If your award start date is 09-01-18 and the current date is 11-15-18, then your first SF-425 would be due no later\nthan 10-30-18 and will cover the period 09-01-18 (award start date) through 09-30-18 (end of the initial reporting\nquarter for this award). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office before the submission deadline so that\nyou can avoid being delinquent and can successfully complete a drawdown of funds through GPRS (submit report\nas soon as you accept the award and have access to the COPS Agency Portal). Awardees who do not submit SF-425s by the due date each quarter will be unable to draw down award funds until\nthe report has been successfully submitted. The payment system contains a function which checks for SF-425\ndelinquency and will reject a drawdown attempt if the SF-425 is not up to date. Subsequent email, fax, and/or hard\ncopy reminders may be sent to the awardee if the SF-425 is delinquent. For general information concerning online filing of SF-425 reports, go to www.cops.usdoj.gov or contact the COPS\nOffice Response Center by phone at 800-421-6770 or by email at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov.
