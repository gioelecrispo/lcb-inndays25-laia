  "chunk_text": "Your agency should ensure that you have financial internal\ncontrols in place to monitor the use of AHTF funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms and\nconditions. Good stewardship in this area would include written accounting practices, use of an accounting system\nthat tracks all award drawdowns and expenditures, and the ability to track when award-funded positions are filled\nor vacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit complete reports or submit\nthem in a timely manner may result in the suspension and possible termination of your agency’s COPS Office award\nfunding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit a quarterly Federal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the\naward period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period\nand the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to\ndraw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however, you will have a 90-day\ngrace period after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred\nbefore the award end date. How do we file a Federal Financial Report (SF-425)? All COPS Office award recipients are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Recipients are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office Agency Portal\nwebsite at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov to log in; once you are logged in, select “Applications” from the agency\nportal menu, click on the “SF-425” icon, and follow the instructions to complete and submit your reports. The\nonline SF-425 requires the same reporting information as the paper version. The use of this online application\nenables authorized users to view past reports and allows them to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports (SF-425) due? SF-425s for COPS Office awards must be submitted every quarter and no later than 30 days after the last day of\neach reporting quarter, as detailed in table 1:\nTable 1.
