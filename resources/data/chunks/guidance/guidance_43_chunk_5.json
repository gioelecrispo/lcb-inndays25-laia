Additional copies of the Assurances and Certifications forms are contained in the appendices of\nthis manual. If you have any questions about them, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist via\nthe COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. 4 2019 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual 3. Allowable Costs\nCondition: The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs for activities related to the establishment and\nenhancement of a variety of problem-solving strategies to investigate illicit activities related to heroin, fentanyl,\ncarfentanil, or other opioids in your jurisdiction. The allowable costs for which your agency’s award has been\napproved are limited to those listed on the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which is included in your\nagency’s award package. The FCM specifies the costs that your agency is allowed to fund with your AHTF award,\nand specifies the overall amount approved for each budget request category. Your agency may not use AHTF award\nfunds for any costs that are not identified as allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual allowable costs incurred during the award period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown. If\nyour agency experiences any cost savings over the course of the award (for example, your award application\noverestimated the total entry-level officer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use that excess\nfunding to extend the length of the award beyond 24 months. Any funds remaining after your agency has drawn\ndown for the costs approved during the 24-month funding period will be deobligated during the closeout process,\nand should not be spent by your agency. Why this condition:\nFunding under this project may only be used for the purchase of items and services approved by the COPS Office as\nreflected in the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM). The COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force program funds\nthe hiring of personnel and purchase of equipment, services, and other items that will allow recipients the\nopportunity to establish and enhance a variety of projects to encourage the continuation and enhancement of\ncommunity policing efforts while investigating heroin and other opioid problems in your jurisdiction. To be eligible for payment under this award, the purchase or hire of approved items/personnel must be made on\nor after the award start date and comply with the guidelines described in the “Accessing Award Funds” section of\nthis manual.
