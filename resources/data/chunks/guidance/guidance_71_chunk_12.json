For federal awards in excess of $250,000, any modification request involving the reallocation of funding\nbetween budget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of the total approved budget 10 2019 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual\nrequires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award amount or budget modification\npercentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In addition, any budget\nmodification that changes the scope of the project requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you are required to expend federal\nfunds only as approved in the FCM. Requests to change or alter an award that meet certain threshold\nrequirements must be submitted to the COPS Office for written approval, prior to their purchase or\nimplementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it was originally\noutlined and accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within the\noriginal scope of the award. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved. Your agency may reprogram its budget up to an aggregate (over the course of your project) of 10 percent of the\ntotal project cost without prior written approval from the COPS Office. However, you should notify your COPS\nOffice Program Manager of any reprogramming that falls below the 10 percent threshold as well. For awards in\nexcess of $250,000, any reprogramming of funds that totals an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the approved\nbudget requires prior written approval from the COPS Office. What you should do: You are required to notify your COPS Office Program Manager if you determine that your agency will need to\nreprogram award funds. If your modification exceeds an aggregated (over the course of your project) 10 percent of\nyour overall award, your agency must access https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. Please contact your COPS Office Program Manager for further direction on any additional requirements that may\napply to your modification request. The COPS Office will then evaluate your request and notify your agency of our\ndecision in writing. Implementation of the modified award budget may begin following written approval from the\nCOPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for active awards will be accompanied by a modified FCM\nreflecting the approved changes. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of its award programs. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. 34 U.S.C. § 10385(b). Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may be\ncarried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the act."
