Restrictions on Internal Confidentiality Agreements\nCondition: No recipient or subrecipient under this award, or entity that receives a contract or subcontract with any funds\nunder this award, may require any employee or contractor to sign an internal confidentiality agreement or\nstatement that prohibits or otherwise restricts the lawful reporting of waste, fraud, or abuse to an investigative or\nlaw enforcement representative of a federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, Public Law 116-6, Division D, Title VII, Section 742. Why this condition:\nUnder section 742 of Division D, Title VII, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (Pub. L. 116-6), neither the\nrecipient, subrecipient, nor any entity that receives a contract or subcontract with any funds under this or any\nother Act may require its employees or contractors to sign an internal confidentiality agreement or statement\nprohibiting or otherwise restricting their lawful reporting of waste, fraud, or abuse to an investigative or law\nenforcement representative of a federal department or agency. This provision protects the public interest and\nensures the proper management and use of federal funds. This limitation is not intended, and shall not be\nunderstood by the agency making this award, to contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312 (which\nrelates to classified information), Form 4414 (which relates to sensitive compartmented information), or any other\nform issued by a federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. What you should do: In accepting this award, the recipient\n• represents that it neither requires nor has required internal confidentiality agreements or statements from\nemployees or contractors that currently prohibit or otherwise restrict (or purport to prohibit or restrict)\nemployees or contractors from reporting waste, fraud, or abuse as described above;\n• represents that, if it learns or is notified that it is or has been requiring its employees or contractors to\nexecute agreements or statements that prohibit or otherwise restrict (or purport to prohibit or restrict)\nreporting of waste, fraud, or abuse as described above, it will immediately stop any further obligations of\naward funds, will provide prompt written notification to the agency making this award, and will resume such\nobligations only if expressly authorized to do so by that agency. If the recipient does or is authorized to make subawards or contracts under this award, in accepting, the recipient\n• represents that it has or will determine that no other entity that the recipient proposes may or will receive\naward funds (whether through a subaward, contract, or subcontract) either requires or has required internal\nconfidentiality agreements or statements from employees or contractors that currently prohibit or otherwise\nrestrict (or purport to prohibit or restrict) employees or contractors from reporting waste, fraud, or abuse as\ndescribed above;\n• represents that it has or will make appropriate inquiry, or otherwise has an adequate factual basis, to support\nthis representation; 28"
