The BA will review the modifi­\ncation to ensure the budget is allowable and meets all\nregulations and policies. The BA will work with the PM\nfor any points of clarification, changes, or justification. Any changes required by the BA will result in the rejection\nof the modification, and the recipient will have to resubmit. In the case of any rejection, an automatic notification\nwill be sent out via e-mail, and the award’s status changes\nto the green “No action required” icon, from which you\ncan initiate another request. In the case of any approval, an automatic notification\nwill be sent out via e-mail. Implementation of the modified award budget may\nbegin following this written approval from the COPS\nOffice. The modification approvals for active awards\nwill be accompanied by a modified FCM reflecting the\napproved changes.
