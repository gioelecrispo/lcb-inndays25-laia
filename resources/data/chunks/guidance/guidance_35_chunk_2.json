While the agencies do not determine whether a program qualifies for special purpose credit\nstatus, creditors with questions about any aspect of ECOA and Regulation B’s special purpose\ncredit provisions may consult their appropriate regulatory agencies. 2 See 15 U.S.C. § 1691(c)(1)-(3); 12 C.F.R. § 1002.8(a).\n3 See 86 Fed.
