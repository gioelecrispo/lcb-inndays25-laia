You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and\ninformation-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information about\nyour award activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.327 200.328. The progress report is used to track your agency’s progress toward implementing community policing\nstrategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency’s community policing capacity\nthrough COPS Office funding. The Federal Financial Report is used to track the expenditures of the recipient’s award\nfunds on a cumulative basis throughout the life of the award. 10 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government must be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress of\nour programs and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with TRGP\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the “Account Access” tab on the COPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within\n30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the award\nperiod. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period, and the\nremaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw\ndown federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date, however you will have a 90-day grace\nperiod after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before\nthe award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic or financial report submission per\nfiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to\nreceive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting requirements. These reports are discussed in\ngreater detail in the section titled “Reporting Requirements” in this manual. All reports should be submitted within\nthe deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions; failure\nto submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities."
