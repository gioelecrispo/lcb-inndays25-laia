  "chunk_text": "The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal expenditures that\nwere incurred during the life of the award, as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. The\nfederal funds expended should reflect only the actual allowable incurred salary and fringe benefit costs for the 36month award period that each award position was occupied. In addition, once you have completed your final\ndrawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of federal funds drawn down by your agency. The\nfinal SF-425 should also report the total amount of the local cash match contributed over the 36-month award\nperiod, which should be at least 25 percent of the total award project, unless waived by the COPS Office in writing. When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency has incurred but has\nnot yet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the award period to request reimbursement for funds\nobligated. Please be advised that 2 CFR Part 200.343(a) requires recipients to submit final SF-425s and 2 CFR Part 200.343(b)\nrequires recipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of\nthe award. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess award funds remaining in your account following the award period\ndue to an overestimate of item costs during the award period. Your agency should review its records carefully to\nensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred during the award\nperiod. Any excess unobligated or unspent funds should remain in your account and will be deobligated during the\ncloseout process. Final Program Progress (Closeout) Report After your award period has ended, your agency may be sent a final progress or closeout report from the COPS\nOffice and asked to complete it. This report will serve as your agency’s final programmatic report on the award,\nand the information your agency provides in this report will be used to make a final assessment of your award\nprogress. 50 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner’s Manual Retention At the conclusion of 36 months of federal funding for each awarded officer position, your agency must implement\nits plan, submitted at the time of award application, to retain the additional COPS Office-funded officer position(s)\nwith state or local funds for a minimum of 12 months as required by the award conditions in this manual. If an\nagency is awarded several officer positions, the retention period for each individual officer position begins upon\ncompletion of 36 months of federal funding for each position (not based on the cumulative award end date)."
