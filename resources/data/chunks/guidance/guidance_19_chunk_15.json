The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to conduct\nsite visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is threefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare\nfor the review of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period of one or\nmore days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while onsite or, if necessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an opportunity to seek\ncustomer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 13 2019 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual\n2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an EOBGR\nconducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative for\nconducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office’s overall award monitoring strategy. The\npurpose of the EOBGR is threefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Recipients will have an opportunity to\nresolve any identified noncompliance issues, if necessary, following the EOBGR interview. In addition,\naward recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a noncompliance\nissue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media,\ncitizens, law enforcement agencies, other Federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case basis,\nCOPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints\nof alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the\nOIG. Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or nonviolation based upon the preponderance of the\nsupporting documentation or other facts to determine if the award recipient is in compliance or\nnoncompliance. Audit liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award."
