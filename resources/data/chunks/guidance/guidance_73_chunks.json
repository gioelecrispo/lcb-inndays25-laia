The 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) provides\nfunding directly to federally recognized tribal jurisdictions with established law enforcement agencies.

      "content": "The 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) provides\nfunding directly to federally recognized tribal jurisdictions with established law enforcement agencies. TRGP\nwas designed to expand the implementation of community policing and meet the most serious needs of\nlaw enforcement in tribal communities through a broadened comprehensive program. In FY 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a single Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation\n(CTAS) that encompasses the department’s available tribal government-specific grant programs. CTAS\nenabled each tribe to submit a single application for available grant funding according to the tribes’ needs. This coordinated process allowed DOJ to review a single application from a tribe, and it allowed the DOJ\ngrant-making components to coordinate in making award decisions to address these public safety needs on\na more comprehensive basis. The 2015 TRGP, which was also CTAS Purpose Area #1: Public Safety and Community Policing, consists of\ntwo types of grants. The TRGP-Hiring grants are for entry-level salaries and benefits for newly hired or rehired\ncareer law enforcement officers, and the TRGP-Equipment/Training (TRGP-E/T) grants provide funding for\nbackground investigations, training, uniforms, basic issue equipment, technology, and vehicles for tribal law\nenforcement agencies. To support community policing, particularly the development of partnerships and problem solving, 2015\nTRGP grantees may be offered training and technical assistance by COPS Office training and technical\nassistance providers. Trainings will assist grantees in the advancement of community policing and may\naddress specific public safety issues facing tribal communities. The COPS Office or its technical assistance\nproviders will notify TRGP grantees about training and technical assistance opportunities. Grantees are\nencouraged to participate in the training and technical assistance opportunities to further their public safety\nefforts. This COPS Office TRGP Grant Owner’s Manual will assist your agency with the administrative and financial\nmatters associated with managing your grant. It was developed by the COPS Office to ensure that all\nCOPS TRGP grantees clearly understand and meet the requirements of their grant. Please review this\nmanual carefully, because a failure to follow grant requirements may result in serious penalties. Please\ndo not hesitate to call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 if you need assistance with the\nimplementation of your grant. Thank you for providing us with the opportunity to work in partnership with your community. 1 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual I.

For more information on drawing down grant funds, please see section III, “Accessing Grant\nFunds,” on page 56 of this document. The award document The award document is the document indicating your official grant funding amount, the number of officer\npositions awarded, the type of positions awarded, the grant number, the grant conditions, and the award\nstart and end dates. The award document is pre-printed with your agency’s law enforcement and government executives’\nnames. If this information is incorrect or has changed, please update your “Agency Contacts” online at\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov through the “Account Access” link. If the law enforcement or government official has\nchanged since the time of application, please have the current law enforcement executive or government\nexecutive for your agency create an account through the “Account Access” link, log in, and sign the award\ndocument once your agency contacts have been updated online. Once you have reviewed your award\ndocument, please electronically sign it and make a copy of all pages of the document for your records, along\nwith all award condition pages, within 90 days of the date shown on the award congratulatory letter. The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed for\nany allowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your TRGP grant award is three years (36\nmonths) of funding for each position awarded. Your grant number is in the following format: 2015-HEWX-0000 for TRGP-E/T awards and 2015-HHWX-0000\nfor TRGP-Hiring grants awarded in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. The COPS Office tracks grant information based upon\nthis number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency’s grant number (or your agency’s ORI number)\nreadily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five\nnumbers or letters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for\nuse in tracking information for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic grant\ninformation based upon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI,\nthe COPS Office assigns a non-official ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two\ncharacters will be “ZZ”). If you have any questions regarding your grant, please refer to your grant number or\nyour agency’s ORI number when you contact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency’s nine- or\n13-digit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP\nvendor number differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for\nadministrative purposes in connection with this grant program, and should not be used for IRS purposes. 2 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Grant conditions The grant conditions are listed on your agency’s award document.

What you should do:\nPlease read the entire TRGP Grant Owner’s Manual carefully prior to signing the grant award document. If\nyou have any questions, please contact your COPS Office GPS. When accepting your grant award, you should\nensure that the proper reporting and financial systems are in place to satisfy the grant requirements. 2. Assurances and Certifications The grantee acknowledges its agreement to comply with the Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed\nas part of its grant application. Why this condition:\nAlthough the COPS Office has made every effort to simplify the process of applying for and receiving grants,\nseveral provisions of federal law require us to seek your assurances and certification regarding certain\nmatters. Most of the assurances and certifications apply to all federal grant programs. What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS Office grant programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at\nthe time of application. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have read, understood,\nand accepted the grant terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications. Your agency\nis required to keep Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed as part of its grant application. Please read these documents carefully, because signatures on these documents are treated as a material\nrepresentation of fact upon which reliance will be placed when the U.S. Department of Justice determines\nwhether to award the covered grant. Additional copies of the Assurances and Certifications forms are\ncontained in appendix B of this manual on page 71. If you have any questions about the Assurances and\nCertifications, please contact your COPS Office GPS at 800-421-6770. 3. Allowable costs The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs to meet the most serious needs of law\nenforcement in tribal communities. The allowable costs for which your agency’s grant has been approved are\nlimited to those listed on the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which are included in your agency’s award\npackage. The FCM specifies the amount of TRGP funds awarded to your agency. You should carefully review your FCM, which\ncontains the final officer salary and fringe benefit categories and amounts for which your agency was approved. Please note that the salary and fringe benefit costs requested in your grant application may have been adjusted or\nremoved. Your agency may only be reimbursed for the approved cost categories that are documented within the\nFCM, up to the amounts specified in the FCM. Your agency may not use TRGP grant funds for any costs that are not\nidentified as allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. 4 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Only actual allowable costs incurred during the grant award period will be eligible for reimbursement and\ndrawdown."

If your agency experiences any cost savings over the course of the grant (for example, your grant\napplication overestimated the total entry-level officer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use\nthat excess funding to extend the length of the grant beyond 36 months. Any funds remaining after your agency\nhas drawn down for the costs of approved salaries and fringe benefits incurred for each awarded position during\nthe 36-month funding period for each awarded position will be deobligated during the closeout process, and\nshould not be spent by your agency. Why this condition:\nTRGP-Hiring funds may be used only to pay entry-level salaries and fringe benefits for 36 months for career\nlaw enforcement officers hired or rehired on or after the award start date. You may use the TRGP grant to hire\nor rehire experienced officers, but grant funding must be limited to paying your agency’s entry-level salary\nand fringe benefits; any costs higher than entry level must be paid by your agency with local funds. TRGP-Hiring grant funding may also be used to pay the approved entry-level salaries and fringe benefits of\nnewly hired officer recruits while they are in basic academy training prior to swearing them in, if it is your\nagency’s standard practice to pay recruits while in training. What you should do: All grantees should keep and maintain the most recent, approved version of 2015 TRGP application, which\nwill contain the approved costs for this grant. Refer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable costs. As long as funds are spent during the grant period on the approved salaries and benefits (as applicable),\nequipment, technology, training, or other costs that were documented in your application’s budget\nsummary and were approved through the issuance of the FCM, this grant condition will be satisfied. Salaries covered by TRGP-Hiring must be based on your agency’s standard entry-level salary and fringe\nbenefits package under the laws or rules that govern hiring by your agency. Salary and fringe benefits\npayments must be based on payroll records supported by time and attendance records or their equivalent. Examples of the types of records your agency must keep to document allowable costs are described in\nsection IV on page 59 of this manual. Any additional costs above the approved entry-level salaries and\nfringe benefits are the responsibility of the grantee agency. Civilian positions, overtime, training, weapons,\ncommunication equipment, and vehicles cannot be funded with your TRGP-Hiring grant. Allowable costs: Approved salary and benefits The FCM, included in your award package, specifies the approved amount of COPS Office TRGP-Hiring funds\nawarded to your agency for officer salaries and approved benefits. Please note that the salary and benefit\ncosts requested in your original application may have been updated or corrected from the original version\nsubmitted to the COPS Office."

Allowable costs: Indirect costs Indirect costs are costs that are incurred for common or joint purposes and are not readily assignable to\na particular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance of the project. Examples of indirect costs include those incurred for facility operation and maintenance, depreciation, and\nadministrative salaries. Indirect cost usage must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance 2 C.F.R. Part 200.56—Indirect (facilities & administrative\n(F&A)) costs and 2 C.F.R. Part 200.414—Indirect (F&A) costs. Additional guidance for your entity can be found\nin the following locations: Appendix III to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and 5 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs); Appendix IV to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs\nIdentification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations; Appendix VII to Part\n200—States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals. Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses that are approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency\ncarefully track and update its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office grant award period. The grantee understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of\napplication, it will be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a\ncurrent indirect cost rate agreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the\naward prohibiting the obligation, expenditure, or drawdown of funds reimbursement for indirect costs until\na current indirect cost rate has been approved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS\nOffice. If your agency’s approved indirect cost rate expires during the grant award period, a current approved rate\nmust be submitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down grant funding for indirect costs. Your agency must advise the COPS Office in writing of any changes to your approved indirect cost rate\nduring the grant award period and must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect any\nrate change. If your agency has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, then you may request up to a flat 10\npercent de minimis indirect cost rate applied to the modified total direct costs (MTDC). In addition, before the COPS Office officially closes out your agency’s grant award, your agency must\nreconcile any changes between your approved final indirect cost rate and approved provisional indirect cost\nrate and, if necessary, repay the COPS Office for any indirect cost rate overpayment."

If your agency draws\ndown excess COPS Office grant funding for indirect costs, please return the overpayment to the COPS Office\nand submit a revised Federal Financial Report (SF-425). See the COPS Office website for a fact sheet on indirect costs: http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/ pdf/2015AwardDocs/cpd/Indirect_Cost_Rate_Fact_Sheet.pdf. 4. Supplementing, not supplanting\nState, local, and tribal governments must use TRGP grant funds to supplement, and not supplant, state, local, or BIA\nfunds that are already committed or otherwise would have been committed for grant purposes (hiring, training,\npurchases, and/or activities) during the grant period. In other words, grantees may not use COPS Office funds to\nsupplant (replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to the COPS Office-funded item(s) in\nthe absence of the COPS Office grant. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that grant funds may not be used to\nreplace state or local funds (or, for tribal grantees, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be\nmade available for the grant purposes. What you should do:\nTRGP-Hiring grantees may not use grant funds to pay for any item or cost funded under the grant\n(equipment, personnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA\nfunds, or committed to the grantee’s budget. 6 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual TRGP-Hiring —To meet this grant condition, you must ensure that the following: • If your agency is redeploying a current employee to perform the work duties of the TRGP-Hiring position, the redeployed position must be paid with local funds. The COPS Office grant funds may be\nused to backfill the resulting vacancy with newly hired personnel for an equivalent amount of time. Each individual employed under the TRGP-Hiring grant must be newly hired or rehired on or after the\ngrant award start date unless an exception is authorized in writing by the COPS Office. • Any officer your agency hires brings your force not only to a number over and above the number of\nfunded positions that you had on the date of your Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS),\nincluding funded but vacant positions, but also to a number over and above the number of locally\nfunded officer positions during the grant award period. • During the life of your grant, your agency must continue to hire as many new, locally funded officers as you would have hired if you had not received your grant. Your agency may not cancel or postpone\nspending money in its budget that is committed to hiring other new officers. • Your agency must take active and timely steps to fill any vacancies that were created on or after the date of your grant application by retirement, resignation, or other reasons with new officers in addition\nto your TRGP-Hiring grant-funded positions.

Note: This grant condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your\nagency under this grant. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any partner agencies use COPS Office\nfunds only to supplement, not supplant, their state, local, or BIA funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nYour agency may request an extension of the grant award period to receive additional time to implement your\ngrant program. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Grants may be extended a maximum of 36\nmonths beyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated\non a case-by-case basis. Only those grantees that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted\nno-cost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include difficulties in filling COPS Office-funded positions, officer\nturnover, or other circumstances that interrupt the 36-month grant funding period. An extension allows your\nagency to compensate for such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding for\neach position awarded. Extension requests must be received prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the grant award period require prior written approval from the\nCOPS Office. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding\nfor costs incurred beyond the official grant award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to\naccommodate reasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office grant. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the grant award period to determine\nwhether a no-cost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days before the\ngrant end date. Requests to extend the grant award period must be received by the COPS Office before the\nofficial grant award end date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will be considered only\nwhen the grantee provides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an\ninstance in which an unforeseen natural disaster prevented a grantee from requesting an extension. Failure\nto submit a request for a no-cost time extension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation\nof any remaining grant funds. 7 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Automatic extensions will be granted for grantee requests of six months or less. All extension requests\nbeyond six months will require review and approval by the COPS Office. Individual or cumulative requests\ngreater than one-half of the grant’s original term (i.e., 18 months) will require additional justification and\nmust include a detailed timeline."

Individual or cumulative requests\ngreater than one-half of the grant’s original term (i.e., 18 months) will require additional justification and\nmust include a detailed timeline. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the grant due to salary and fringe benefits costs that\nwere lower than anticipated, your agency may not extend the 36-month funding period for the purpose of\nexpending those excess funds. Grantees are entitled to a maximum of 36 months of federal funding based\non the approved salary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining\ngrant funds during the closeout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time\nextension, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 6. Modifications\nOccasionally, a change in an agency’s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its TRGP award. Grant modifications under TRGP are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All modification requests involving the\npurchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their implementation. In\naddition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that results in an increase\nof federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram grant funds. Acceptable examples of such\naward modifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items,\nor purchasing a different type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may\nexpend grant funds only as approved in the FCM. Any requests to change or alter grant awards require\nwritten approval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Without prior written approval, you\nmust continue to implement your grant as it was originally awarded and accepted by your agency. Please be\nadvised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be approved (e.g., construction). What you should do: For all modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the “Account Access” link\nin the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office, providing the proposed\nchanges, details of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific grant modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified grant award\nmay begin following written approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for\nactive grants will often be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes. If applicable, your agency is required to sign and submit the modified award document via the “Account\nAccess” link to officially accept the grant modification. 7.

The grantee agrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. 8 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the Attorney General for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nact. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office\nmay assess the way in which your agency implements its grant. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or\nevaluators may study the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect\ninformation about the programs’ effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In\naddition, they may ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how\nresidents feel about community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be\nuseful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities,\nand obtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate\nany site visits and information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and\ntimely information about your grant activities. You should fully comply with any requests regarding these\nevaluations. 8. Reports/Performance goals To assist the COPS Office in the monitoring of your award, your agency will be responsible for submitting quarterly\nprogrammatic progress reports and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The\nprogress report is used to track your agency’s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and\nto collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency’s community policing capacity through COPS\nOffice funding. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure\nthe proper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the\nprogress of our programs and grantees. What you should do: This grant condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with TRGP\ngrants. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report will be required\nto be submitted directly to the COPS Office through the “Account Access” portion of the COPS Office\nwebsite at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports\nusing Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will\nbe due within 90 days after the end of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal\nexpenditures incurred during the funding period, and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds."

Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic or financial report submission per fiscal year may 9 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to receive\ntechnical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in\nsection VI, “Reports,” on page 64 of this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to\navoid suspension or possible termination of grant funds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required\nreports may also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Grant monitoring activities\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their grant conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of grant implementation—compliance and programmatic benefits—are part of the monitoring\nprocess coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Grant monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office\ninclude site visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic\nreporting, and audit resolution. As a COPS Office TRGP grantee, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any\nrequests for information pertaining to your grant. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each grant program must\ncontain a monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how grantees are adhering to COPS\nOffice grant requirements and develops the best technical assistance based on this feedback. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an\nentity designated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency’s use of federal funds, both programmatically\nand financially. The most common ways are as follows: • site visits. The COPS Office conducts grantee site visits to ensure compliance with grant terms and conditions. These visits also provide firsthand observation of the grantee’s community policing\nstrategies. The purpose of site visits is threefold: review community policing activities, ensure grantee\ncompliance, and provide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will be notified in\nwriting in advance of any on-site review of your COPS Office grants. This review is generally performed\nover a period of one or more days and also provides an opportunity for agency representatives to seek\nassistance on any grant implementation issues. • enhanced office-based grant reviews (EOBGR).

The purpose\nof the EOBGR is threefold: review community policing activities, ensure grantee compliance, and\nprovide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will be notified in writing in advance\nof any EOBGR of your COPS Office grants.

The U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts random audits for all COPS Office grantees. In the event your agency has any audit recommendations (findings)\nresulting from noncompliance and/or poor accounting practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison\nSection will work with your agency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close\nrecommendations may include repayment of grant funds and/or the submission of documentation. Grantees are responsible for remedying any grant noncompliance that is identified during site visits,\noffice-based grant review, and/or alleged noncompliance reviews. In addition, grantees are responsible\nfor remedying noncompliance stemming from audit recommendations identified in audits of COPS Office\ngrants conducted by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer\n(OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to suspending active grant funding,\nrepayment of unallowable or unsupported costs, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination\nof remaining grant funds, or restriction from receiving future grants for a period of time. Under certain\nconditions, additional actions may include placement on the U.S. Department of Justice’s High Risk List,\nwhich will include mandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training\nand being subject to increased monitoring of current and future grants while on the list.

Federal civil rights As a condition of receipt of federal financial assistance, you acknowledge and agree that you will not (and will\nrequire any sub-grantees, contractors, successors, transferees, and assignees not to), on the grounds of race, color,\nreligion, national origin (which includes providing limited English proficient persons meaningful access to your\nprograms), sex, disability, or age, unlawfully exclude any person from participation in, deny the benefits of or\nemployment to any person, or subject any person to discrimination in connection with any programs or activities\nfunded in whole or in part with federal funds. These civil rights requirements are found in the nondiscrimination\nprovisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. § 2000d); the Omnibus Crime Control and\nSafe Streets Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. § 3789d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended\n(29 U.S.C. § 794); the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. §6101, et seq.); Title IX of the Education Amendments\nof 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq.); and the corresponding DOJ regulations implementing those\nstatutes at 28 C.F.R. Part 42 (subparts C, D, E, G, and I). You also agree to comply with Executive Order 13279 Equal\nTreatment for Faith-Based Organizations and its implementing regulations at 28 C.F.R. Part 38, which requires\nequal treatment of religious organizations in the funding process and nondiscrimination of beneficiaries by FaithBased Organizations on the basis of belief or nonbelief. Why this condition: In establishing financial assistance programs, Congress linked the receipt of federal funding to compliance\nwith federal civil rights laws. As a result, grantees are required to comply with the civil rights requirements\nfound in the nondiscrimination provisions referenced above. A hold may be placed on your award if it is 11 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual deemed that your agency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an\nongoing federal civil rights investigation.

Equal Employment Opportunity Plan All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that established the COPS Office,\nthat “the full and equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in\nthe criminal justice system is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act’s program to reduce crime and\ndelinquency in the United States” 28 C.F.R. § 42.301. The Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) does\nnot impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients of federal funds. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization’s legal status,\nthe number of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization has fewer than 50 employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the\nEEOP requirement. To claim the exemption, your organization must complete and submit section A of the\nCertification Form to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice,\n810 7th Street NW, Washington, DC 20531. The Certification Form can be found at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/\nabout/ocr/pdfs/cert.pdf.

Instead, your organization must maintain\nthe Utilization Report on file and make it available to the OCR for review on request. In addition, your\norganization must complete and submit section B of the Certification Form to the Office for Civil Rights\n(OCR), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, 810 7th Street NW, Washington, DC 20531.

Community policing\nCommunity policing activities to be initiated or enhanced by your agency were identified and described in your\ngrant application. All equipment, technology, training, and/or sworn officer positions awarded under the TRGP\ngrant must be linked to the implementation or enhancement of community policing. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office defines community policing as a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that\nsupport the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the\nimmediate conditions giving rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. TRGP grants must be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities. All newly hired, additional, or\nrehired officers (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) funded under TRGP-Hiring must engage\nin community policing activities. While the COPS Office recognizes that your COPS Office-funded officer(s)\n(or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) will participate in some or all aspects of your identified\ncommunity policing plan and advance your agency’s community policing activities over the life of the grant,\nwe also encourage your agency to move toward an organization-wide philosophy and commitment to\ncommunity policing. COPS Office grants are designed to increase community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This is achieved through problem-solving tactics and community policing partnerships. It enhances police\nprofessionalism by providing officers with the skills and motivation to act in innovative ways to solve\ncommunity crime-related problems. Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure that it is\ninitiating or enhancing community policing in accordance with your proposed plan, and that the officers\nhired (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance\nyour agency’s community policing activities over the life of the grant."

If your agency’s community policing plan\nchanges significantly, however, you must submit those changes in writing to the COPS Office for approval. Changes are significant if they deviate from the range of possible community policing activities identified\nand approved in the original community policing plan submitted with your application. 13 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual 13. Contracts with other jurisdictions\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, and/or sworn law enforcement officer positions awarded may only be\nused for law enforcement activities or services that exclusively benefit your agency and the population that it serves. The items funded under the TRGP grant cannot be utilized by other agencies unless the items would exclusively\nbenefit the population that your agency serves. Why this condition: The TRGP was created under a Congressional appropriation specifically designated for tribal law\nenforcement agencies to improve public safety in Indian communities. The TRGP-Hiring grant funding is\nintended to benefit the communities within the grantee’s primary law enforcement jurisdiction. Therefore,\nthe grantee must use the TRGP grant funding to benefit its own population exclusively. What you should do: Your law enforcement agency should avoid any agreements with other jurisdictions to share officer\npositions or other awarded equipment, technology, or vehicles unless the agreement complies with the\nrequirement that COPS Office-funded items must exclusively benefit the grantee service population. For\nexample, if your jurisdiction has a tribal police department and a BIA department, items funded under the\ngrant might be able to be used by the BIA department as long as this would result in an exclusive benefit\nto the population that you serve. You may not, however, allow officers, equipment, technology, or vehicles\nfunded under the grant to be used by any agency or transferred to any agency that does not exclusively\nbenefit the population that you serve. For example, you may not, during the grant term, loan two of your\nawarded computers to a neighboring county’s sheriff’s department. Officers funded under TRGP-Hiring may not provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies\nunless they will directly benefit the grantee’s jurisdiction. For example, your agency may not use an officer\nfunded under TRGP-Hiring to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but\nyour agency may use the officer to provide direct law enforcement services to the population within your\nagency’s own jurisdiction. Before you enter into any agreement with another law enforcement agency, you should contact your COPS\nOffice Grant Program Specialist (GPS) at 800-421-6770 for additional guidance. 14.

False statements False statements or claims made in connection with COPS Office grants may result in fines, imprisonment, or\ndebarment from participating in federal grants or contracts, and/or any other remedy available by law. Why this condition: This condition advises recipients of the consequences of submitting false claims or statements on\napplications, financial and programmatic reports, or other grant documents. What you should do:\nEnsure that all documentation related to your agency’s receipt and use of grant funding (grant applications,\nprogress reports, Federal Financial Reports, etc.) is true and accurate. 15. Duplicative funding The recipient understands and agrees to notify the COPS Office if it receives, from any other source, funding for the\nsame item or service also funded under this award. 14 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Why this condition: This grant was awarded to your agency to address its law enforcement needs that are not funded from\nother sources, including federal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds. Consequently, your agency may not use this\nfunding for items or services for which you already have funding from other sources. What you should do: If your agency receives funding from another source for the same item(s) or services(s) also funded under\nthis award, please contact your COPS Office GPS at 800-421-6770. If necessary, the COPS Office will work\nwith your agency to reprogram funding for items or services that are allowable under this grant program. 16. Additional high-risk grantee requirements The recipient agrees to comply with any additional requirements that may be imposed during the grant\nperformance period if the awarding agency determines that the recipient is a high-risk grantee (Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 2 C.F.R. § 200.207 as\nadopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. § 2800.101). Why this condition:\nIn accordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.207, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) may impose additional\nrequirements specific to your award, as needed, when it determines that there is unsatisfactory performance,\nfinancial or administrative instability, noncompliance with award terms and conditions, or other lack of\nresponsibility risk factors. In such cases, the U.S. Department of Justice may impose special conditions or\nrestrictions that may include requiring the production of documentation, financial grant administration\ntraining, on-site monitoring, prior approval for expenditure of funds, quarterly progress reports, separate\nbank accounts, or other requirements. What you should do: In order to obtain a COPS Office grant, recipients must agree to comply with any additional requirements\nthat may be imposed during the grant performance period if the awarding agency determines that the\nrecipient is a high-risk grantee. 17.

Other compensation, if the aggregate value of all such other compensation (e.g., severance,\ntermination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or\nproperty) for the executive exceeds $10,000. Why this condition: To further federal spending transparency, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006\n(FFATA) requires, among other things, that information on federal awards (federal financial assistance and\nexpenditures) be made available to the public via a single, searchable website, which is www.USASpending.gov. Grantees are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and sub-award information,\nand the award term provides guidance to report the related information as required by FFATA. What you should do: At the time of grant application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes\nand systems in place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting\nrequirements should it receive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required\nto report award information on any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to\nreport information on the names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives\nof the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the 19 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual website at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward\ninformation and any executive compensation data required by FFATA. The subaward information entered\nin FSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov associated with your agency’s award, furthering\nfederal spending transparency. For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting\nrequirements, please see Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register,\nwww.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-09-14/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 19. Retention At the time of grant application, your agency committed to retaining all sworn officer positions awarded under\nthe TRGP Hiring grant with state and/or local funds for a minimum of 12 months following the conclusion of 36\nmonths of federal funding for each position, over and above the number of locally funded sworn officer positions\nthat would have existed in the absence of the grant. Your agency cannot satisfy the retention requirement by using\nTRGP funded positions to fill locally funded vacancies resulting from attrition. Why this condition: The retention requirement ensures that the increased officer staffing level under the TRGP-Hiring grant\ncontinues with state or local funds for a minimum of 12 months after federal funding ends. What you should do: At the time of grant application, your agency was required to affirm that it planned to retain all sworn officer\npositions awarded under the TRGP-Hiring grant and identify the planned source(s) of retention funding. Your\nagency committed to retaining each awarded position for at least 12 months following the conclusion of 36\nmonths of federal funding for that position. The retention period begins for an awarded officer position once\nthat position has completed the 36-month implementation period."

If an agency is awarded several officer\npositions, the retention period for each individual officer position begins upon completion of 36 months of\nfunding for that position (not based on the cumulative grant award end date). The retained TRGP funded position(s) must be added to your agency’s law enforcement budget with state\nor local funds at the conclusion of grant funding, over and above the number of locally funded sworn officer\npositions that would have existed in the absence of the grant. Absorbing TRGP-funded positions through\nattrition (rather than adding the extra positions to your budget with additional funding) does not meet the\nretention requirement. Your agency should maintain documentation demonstrating when the 36-month grant funding period\nexpires for each awarded position and that each retained position is above and beyond the number of\nofficer positions that your agency would otherwise have funded with state or local funds. We understand\nthat your agency’s identified source(s) of retention funding may change during the life of the grant, so\nyour agency should maintain documentation of any changes in the event of an audit, monitoring, or other\nevaluation of your grant compliance. Please note that your agency is required to retain the officer position(s) awarded under the TRGP-Hiring\ngrant and not the specific officer(s) hired to fill the grant position(s). If a position funded by the TRGPHiring grant becomes vacant during the retention period, your agency is required to take active and timely\nsteps consistent with your agency’s hiring policies and procedures to fill the position with a new officer to\ncomplete the remainder of the 12-month retention period. Your agency should maintain documentation\ndemonstrating that you did not delay filling the position and that the steps your agency took to fill the\nposition were consistent with your hiring policies and procedures. 20 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual At the conclusion of federal funding, agencies that fail to retain the sworn officer positions awarded under\nthe TRGP-Hiring grant may be ineligible to receive future COPS Office grants for a period of three years.

What you should do: If under a COPS Office award you enter into a contract for goods or services that is for $25,000 or more or\nany subaward, you must verify that the vendor or subawardee and their respective principals (e.g., owners,\ntop managers) with whom you intend to do business are not excluded or disqualified from participation\nin federal assistance programs. In addition, you must include a term or condition in the contract or\nsubaward requiring the vendor or subawardee to comply with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 C.F.R.\nPart 180 (Government-wide Debarment and Suspension) and subpart C of 2 C.F.R.

Whistleblower protection The recipient agrees not to discharge, demote, or otherwise discriminate against an employee as reprisal for the\nemployee disclosing information that he/she reasonably believes is evidence of gross mismanagement of a Federal\ncontract or grant, a gross waste of Federal funds, an abuse of authority relating to a Federal contract or grant, a\nsubstantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a Federal 21 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract) or grant. The recipient also agrees to provide\nto their employees in writing (in the predominant native language of the workforce) of the rights and remedies\nprovided in 41 U.S.C. § 4712. Please see Appendix E in the Grant Owner’s Manual for a full text of the statute. Why this condition:\nUnder the “Pilot program for enhancement of contractor protection from reprisal for disclosure of certain\ninformation” (41 U.S.C. § 4712), which is in effect through January 1, 2017, recipients are prohibited from\ntaking reprisal actions against employees for certain whistleblowing activities in connection with federal\ngrants and contracts."

Allowable costs The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs to meet the most serious needs of law\nenforcement in tribal communities. The allowable costs for which your agency’s grant has been approved are\nlimited to those listed on the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which are included in your agency’s award\npackage. The FCM specifies the exact items that your agency is allowed to fund with your TRGP grant, and specifies\nthe overall amount approved for each budget request category. Your agency may not use TRGP grant funds for any\ncosts that are not identified as allowable in the FCM. Why this condition:\nTRGP-Equipment/Training may only be used for the purchase of equipment, technology, training, uniforms,\nand other items approved by the COPS Office as reflected in the FCM. The COPS Office TRGP funds the\npurchase of items that have a link to the implementation or enhancement of community policing initiatives\nin your agency. To be eligible for payment under this grant, the purchase of approved items must be made after the grant\naward start date and comply with the guidelines described in section III, “Accessing Grant Funds,” on page 56\nof this manual. Section IV, “Financial Record Maintenance,” on page 59, outlines the types of records you must\nkeep to document that you followed this grant condition. Purchases must also reflect the costs that were\napproved as shown in the FCM. What you should do: All grantees should keep and maintain the most recent, approved version of 2015 TRGP application, which\nwill contain the approved costs for this grant. Refer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable costs. As long as funds are spent during the grant period on the approved salaries or benefits (as applicable),\nequipment, technology, training, or other costs that were documented in your application’s budget\nsummary and were approved through the issuance of the FCM, this grant condition will be satisfied.

Allowable costs: Background investigations\nBased on the FCM, grantees may have been awarded funding for background investigations for newly\nhired officer positions if other funding (state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)) was not budgeted\nfor the same background investigations. Background investigations must be completed before\nexpenses incurred in connection with such investigations can be reimbursed. Funded background\ninvestigations may not be initiated prior to the official award start date of the grant period. 26 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual B. Allowable costs: Training\nBased on the FCM, grantees may have been awarded funding for otherwise unfunded expenses\nassociated with sending recruits to a state academy that will train and certify tribal police officers,\nto the BIA Indian Police Academy in Artesia, New Mexico, or to basic training from an established\nacademy that trains Indian police officers such as the Navajo Nation’s Academy. Basic law\nenforcement training is encouraged for existing police officers who have not received it, depending\non the needs of your department and the availability of funding. Grant funding may only be used\nfor one cycle of basic training per officer. The grantee agency will be responsible for any additional\ncosts associated with an officer not completing basic training on the first attempt. TRGP funds may also pay for community policing and problem-solving training; specialized law\nenforcement training in such topics as counterterrorism, family violence, and crime prevention and\ndetection; and training related to Indian Country jurisdictional issues. Only requests for training\nby recognized training providers such as the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, the FBI,\nthe BIA Indian Police Academy, a state police academy, COPS Office Regional Community Policing\nInstitutes, or a tribal community college will be considered. In addition, funding may be used to\nattend training conferences such as the National Native American Law Enforcement Association’s\nannual training conference or any COPS Office-sponsored conference. Funding for community policing or other law enforcement training will cover only travel,\nlodging, and per diem expenses for each representative to and from the training site (if training\nis conducted more than 50 miles from your agency headquarters). State academy training costs\ninclude training instruction fees, academy tuition, course fees, textbooks, manuals, supplies, and\ntravel in connection with the training (transportation, lodging, per diem, etc.) if the training is\nlocated more than 50 miles from the job site. If your state academy does not charge for the training,\nyour department will be reimbursed only for travel in connection with the training. Departments\nthat send officers to the BIA Indian Police Academy will be reimbursed for travel costs only, as there\nis no cost for tuition at the BIA Indian Police Academy for tribal officers. TRGP-E/T funds may pay for computer training for systems, hardware, or software that grantees\nalready own but may not be utilizing to the fullest extent due to of a lack of training."

Examples of indirect costs include those incurred for facility operation and maintenance, depreciation, and\nadministrative salaries. Indirect cost usage must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance 2 C.F.R. Part 200.56—Indirect (facilities & administrative\n(F&A)) costs and 2 C.F.R. Part 200.414—Indirect (F&A) costs.

Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses that are approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency\ncarefully track and update its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office grant award period. The grantee understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of application,\nit will be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a current indirect cost\nrate agreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the award prohibiting the\nobligation, expenditure, or drawdown of funds reimbursement for indirect costs until a current indirect cost\nrate has been approved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS Office. If your agency’s approved indirect cost rate expires during the grant award period, a current approved rate\nmust be submitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down grant funding for indirect costs. Your agency must advise the COPS Office in writing of any changes to your approved indirect cost rate\nduring the grant award period and must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect any\nrate change. If your agency has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, then you may request up to a flat 10\npercent de minimis indirect cost rate applied to the modified total direct costs (MTDC). 29 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual"

Grants may be extended a maximum of 36\nmonths beyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated\non a case-by-case basis. Only those grantees that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted\nno-cost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays,\nor other circumstances that interrupt the 36-month grant funding period. An extension allows your agency to\ncompensate for such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding. Extension\nrequests must be received prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the grant award period require prior written approval from the\nCOPS Office."

Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the grant award period require prior written approval from the\nCOPS Office. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding\nfor costs incurred beyond the official grant award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to\naccommodate reasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office grant. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the grant award period to determine\nwhether a no-cost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the grant\nend date. Requests to extend the grant award period must be received by the COPS Office before the official\ngrant award end date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will be considered only when\nthe grantee provides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance\nin which an unforeseen natural disaster prevented a grantee from requesting an extension. Failure to submit\na request for a no-cost time extension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any\nremaining grant funds. Automatic extensions will be granted for grantee requests of six months or less. All extension requests\nbeyond six months will require review and approval by the COPS Office. Individual or cumulative requests\ngreater than one-half of the grant’s original term (i.e., 18 months) will require additional justification and\nmust include a detailed timeline. 31 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the grant due to salary and fringe benefits costs that\nwere lower than anticipated, your agency may not extend the 36-month funding period for the purpose of\nexpending those excess funds. Grantees are entitled to a maximum of 36 months of federal funding based\non the approved salary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining\ngrant funds during the closeout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time\nextension, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 7. Modifications\nOccasionally, a change in an agency’s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its TRGP award. Grant modifications under TRGP are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All modification requests involving the\npurchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their implementation. In\naddition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that results in an increase\nof federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram grant funds. Acceptable examples of such\naward modifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost savings from approved items\nor purchasing a different type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may\nexpend grant funds only as approved in the FCM. Any requests to change or alter grant awards require\nwritten approval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation."

Without prior written approval, you\nmust continue to implement your grant as it was originally awarded and accepted by your agency. Please be\nadvised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs (e.g., construction) will not be approved. What you should do: For all modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the “Account Access” link\nin the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office, providing the proposed\nchanges, details of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific grant modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified grant award\nmay begin following written approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for\nactive grants will often be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes. If applicable, your agency is required to sign and submit the modified award document via the Account\nAccess link to officially accept the grant modification. 8. Evaluations\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS Office TRGP. The grantee\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the Attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nAct. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office\nmay assess the way in which your agency implements its grant. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or\nevaluators may study the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect 32 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual information about the programs’ effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In\naddition, they may ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how\nresidents feel about community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be\nuseful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities,\nand obtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate\nany site visits and information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and\ntimely information about your grant activities. You should fully comply with any requests regarding these\nevaluations. 9. Reports/Performance goals"

Reports/Performance goals To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is\nused to track your agency’s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to\ngauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency’s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure\nthe proper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the\nprogress of our programs and grantees. What you should do: This grant condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with TRGP\ngrants. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report will be required\nto be submitted directly to the COPS Office through the “Account Access” portion of the COPS Office\nwebsite at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports\nusing Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will\nbe due within 90 days after the end of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal\nexpenditures incurred during the funding period, and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred\nafter the official grant end date, however you will have a 90-day grace period after the grant award end\ndate during which you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before the grant end date.. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic or financial report submission per fiscal year may\nbe subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to receive\ntechnical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in\nsection VI, “Reports,” on page 64 of this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to\navoid suspension or possible termination of grant funds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required\nreports may also impact future funding opportunities. 10. Grant monitoring activities\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their grant conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. 33 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Both aspects of grant implementation—compliance and programmatic benefits—are part of the monitoring\nprocess coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice."

Grant monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office\ninclude site visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic\nreporting, and audit resolution. As a COPS Office TRGP grantee, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any\nrequests for information pertaining to your grant. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each grant program must\ncontain a monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how grantees are adhering to COPS\nOffice grant requirements. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an\nentity designated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency’s use of federal funds, both programmatically\nand financially. The most common ways are as follows: • site visits. The COPS Office conducts awardee site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. These visits also provide firsthand observation of the awardee’s community policing\nstrategies. The purpose of site visits is threefold: review community policing activities, ensure awardee\ncompliance, and provide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will be notified in\nwriting in advance of any on-site review of your COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed\nover one or more days and also provides an opportunity for your agency representatives to seek\nassistance on any award implementation issues. • enhanced office-based grant reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, certain grants are selected for a review conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as a\nsupplemental activity in support of the COPS Office’s overall grant monitoring strategy. The purpose\nof the EOBGR is threefold: review community policing activities, ensure grantee compliance, and\nprovide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will be notified in writing in advance\nof any EOBGR of your COPS Office grants. This review is generally performed over a one or more day\nperiod and also provides an opportunity for agency representatives to seek assistance on any grant\nimplementation issues. Your agency will be notified in writing of the results and any action required\nto remedy identified grant violations to include potential and actual vulnerabilities. Additionally,\npromising practices identified during the EOBGR are documented and may be shared with the law\nenforcement community. • alleged noncompliance reviews (ANCR) . An alleged noncompliance review is a follow up on complaints of alleged noncompliance received from external (media and/or citizen complaints) or\ninternal (COPS Office/DOJ staff ) sources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office staff members determine\nthe appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance.

Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to suspending active grant funding,\nrepayment of unallowable or unsupported costs, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination\nof remaining grant funds, or restriction from receiving future grants for a period of time. Under certain\nconditions, additional actions may include placement on the U.S. Department of Justice’s High Risk List,\nwhich will include mandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training\nand being subject to increased monitoring of current and future grants while on the list. In the event of\ncriminal misuse of grant funds, grantees may also be subject to fines and imprisonment. To avoid findings\nof noncompliance, grantees are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the COPS Grant Monitoring\nDivision’s Grant Monitoring Standards and Guidelines and with the Grant Owner’s Manual for the year\nin which the grant is awarded. Grantees should also contact the COPS Office or their Grant Program\nSpecialist at any time during the life of a COPS Office grant with questions concerning grant conditions,\nterms, or requirements to seek guidance to avoid noncompliance. It is necessary for grantees to maintain\nall relevant documentation (administrative, financial, and programmatic) used to develop the application\nand implement the grant that may be necessary or required to demonstrate grant compliance.

TRGP grants must be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities. All newly hired, additional, or\nrehired officers (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) funded under TRGP-Hiring must engage\nin community policing activities. While the COPS Office recognizes that your COPS Office-funded officer(s)\n(or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) will participate in some or all aspects of your identified\ncommunity policing plan and advance your agency’s community policing activities over the life of the grant,\nwe also encourage your agency to move toward an organization-wide philosophy and commitment to\ncommunity policing. COPS Office grants are designed to increase community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This is achieved through problem-solving tactics and community policing partnerships. It enhances police\nprofessionalism by providing officers with the skills and motivation to act in innovative ways to solve\ncommunity crime-related problems. Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure that it is\ninitiating or enhancing community policing in accordance with your proposed plan, and that the officers\nhired (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance\nyour agency’s community policing activities over the life of the grant. The COPS Office may also use this\ninformation to understand the needs of the field, and potentially provide for training, technical assistance,\nproblem solving, and community policing implementation tools. What you should do:\nCommunity policing activities to be implemented or enhanced by your agency were identified in your grant\napplication. Your community policing needs may change during the life of your grant, and minor changes to\nthis plan may be made without prior approval of the COPS Office. If your agency’s community policing plan\nchanges significantly, however, you must submit those changes in writing to the COPS Office for approval. Changes are significant if they deviate from the range of possible community policing activities identified\nand approved in the original community policing plan submitted with your application. 14. Contracts with other jurisdictions\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, and/or sworn law enforcement officer positions awarded may only be\nused for law enforcement activities or services that exclusively benefit your agency and the population that it serves. The items funded under the TRGP grant cannot be utilized by other agencies unless the items would exclusively\nbenefit the population that your agency serves. Why this condition: The TRGP was created under a Congressional appropriation specifically designated for tribal law\nenforcement agencies to improve public safety in Indian communities. The TRGP-E/T grant funding is\nintended to benefit the communities within the grantee’s primary law enforcement jurisdiction.

Therefore,\nthe grantee must use the TRGP grant funding to benefit its own population exclusively. 37 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual What you should do: Your law enforcement agency should avoid any agreements with other jurisdictions to share officer\npositions or other awarded equipment, technology, or vehicles, unless the agreement complies with the\nrequirement that COPS Office-funded items must exclusively benefit the grantee service population. For\nexample, if your jurisdiction has both a tribal police department and a BIA department, items funded under\nthe grant might be able to be used by the BIA department as long as this would result in an exclusive\nbenefit to the population that you serve.

Duplicative funding The recipient understands and agrees to notify the COPS Office if it receives, from any other source, funding for the\nsame item or service also funded under this award. Why this condition: This grant was awarded to your agency to address its law enforcement needs that are not funded with other\nfunds, including federal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds. Consequently, your agency may not use this funding\nfor items or services that you already have funding for from other sources. What you should do: If your agency receives funding from another source for the same item(s) or services(s) also funded under\nthis award, please contact your COPS Office GPS at 800-421-6770.

Other compensation, if the aggregate value of all such other compensation (e.g., severance,\ntermination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or\nproperty) for the executive exceeds $10,000. Why this condition: To further federal spending transparency, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006\n(FFATA) requires, among other things, that information on federal awards (federal financial assistance and\nexpenditures) be made available to the public via a single, searchable website, which is www. USASpending. gov. Grantees are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and sub-award\ninformation and the award term provides guidance to report the related information, as required by FFATA. What you should do: At the time of grant application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes\nand systems in place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting\nrequirements should it receive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required\nto report award information on any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to\nreport information on the names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives\nof the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the\nwebsite at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward\ninformation and any executive compensation data required by FFATA. The subaward information entered\nin FSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov associated with your agency’s award, furthering\nfederal spending transparency. For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting requirements,\nplease see Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register,\nwww.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-09-14/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 20. Criminal intelligence systems\nGrantees using TRGP funds to operate an inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. The grantee acknowledges that it has completed, signed, and submitted\nwith its grant award the relevant Special Condition certifying its compliance with 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found at\n28 C.F.R. Part 23. An interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system which\nreceives, stores, analyzes, and exchanges or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal\nactivities (examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property\ntrafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling, bribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other\nlaw enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23 contains operating principles for these interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence systems that protect individual privacy and constitutional rights. 43"

Sole source justification\nTRGP-Equipment/Training grantees who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group\nof items) or service in excess of $150,000, and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement\nprocess must provide a written sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating,\nexpending, or drawing down grant funds for that item or service. Why this condition: In general, grant recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in some instances, grantees may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do:\nA grant recipient must request written approval from the COPS Office for sole source procurements in\nexcess of $150,000 prior to purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract;\nor entering into a contract with grant funds. For the purchase of equipment, technology, or services under\na COPS Office grant or award, recipients must use their own documented procurement procedures that\nreflect applicable state and local laws and regulations, as long as those requirements conform to the federal\nprocurement requirements set forth in 2 C.F.R. § 200.320 as adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in\n2 C.F.R. § 2800.101. A sole source justification request should be submitted if a recipient determines that\nthe award of a contract through a competitive process is infeasible. The COPS Office may authorize a\nnoncompetitive proposal if one or more of the following circumstances apply: The initial determination that competition is not feasible can be made if one of the following circumstances\nexists: • The item/service is available only from one source. • Public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive\nsolicitation. • Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. 44"

What you should do:\nEnsure that you timely report in writing to the COPS Office or pass-through entity all federal violations\ninvolving fraud, bribery, or gratuity that may affect your federal award. 27. Conflict of interest\nFederal awardees and subawardees must disclose in writing to the COPS Office or pass-through entity, as\napplicable, any potential conflict of interest affecting the awarded federal funding in accordance with the Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 2 C.F.R. § 200.112 as\nadopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. § 2800.101. Why this condition:\nAwardees and subawardees are required to use federal funding in the best interest of their award program. Any decisions related to these funds must be free of hidden personal or organizational conflicts of interest,\nboth in fact and in appearance. This means that awardees and subawardees should not participate in any award-related decisions or\nrecommendations that involve any of the following people or groups: • An immediate family member\n• A partner\n• An organization in which they are serving as an officer, director, partner, or employee\n• Any person or organization with whom they are negotiating or who has an arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest, or for other reasons can have less than an unbiased\ntransaction with the awardee or subawardee 48 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual This also means that awardees and subawardees should avoid any action which might result in or create the\nappearance of • using your official position for private gain;\n• giving special treatment to any person;\n• losing complete independence or objectivity;\n• making an official decision outside official channels; or\n• affecting negatively the confidence of the public in the integrity of the Federal Government or the\nprogram. What you should do:\nEnsure that you report in writing to the COPS Office or pass-through entity, as applicable, any potential\nconflict of interest that may affect your federal award. 28. Contract provision All contracts made by the award recipients under the federal award must contain the provisions required under 2\nC.F.R. Appendix II to part 200 (Appendix II to Part 200—Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity Contracts Under\nFederal Awards) as adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. § 2800.101.

Why this condition:\nFederal regulations require recipients and subrecipients to comply with the necessary contract provisions\nin order to standardize and strengthen oversight of all contracts made under federal awards. This provision\nprotects the public interest and ensures the proper management and use of federal funds as it relates to\ncontracts entered into by the recipient. What you should do: The recipient should review all contracts made under the federal award to ensure that they contain the\nprovisions required in appendix F of the Grant Owner’s Manual. 29. Computer network requirement The recipient understands and agrees that no award funds may be used to maintain or establish a computer\nnetwork unless such network blocks the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. Nothing in this\nrequirement limits the use of funds necessary for any federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any\nother entity carrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. Why this condition:\nSection 534 of Division B, Title V, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.\nL. 113-235) prohibits the use of federal funds to maintain or establish a computer network that does not\nblock the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography.

For assistance with financial management and grant administration, please contact the\nCOPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one method of payment available for accessing federal grant funds—the Grant Payment\nRequest System (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables grantees to use a secure Internet\nconnection to request funds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury. A grantee will be able to review previous requests made since July 2009. For more information on the GPRS, please go to www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view the\nuser guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a GPRS account? If you are a new grantee to the COPS Office, your law enforcement executive or government executive\nshould receive notification about GPRS shortly after the COPS Office receives your original signed award\ndocument. This notification will contain all of the information that your agency needs to set up the GPRS\npayment method. If your law enforcement executive or government executive does not perform drawdown\nrequests for your agency, your grant administrator will need to go online to https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/ gprs/welcome to log in and register to become a Drawdown Specialist. Once you are approved, you will\nreceive an e-mail containing a temporary password and information on how to use GPRS. Please note that\npart of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement executive or government\nexecutive or other financial points of contact to validate information provided by the Drawdown Specialist. If you are already registered for a COPS Office grant username in GPRS, and would like to add a newly\nawarded COPS Office grant to the existing COPS Office grant username, contact the COPS Office GPRS\nregistration team via e-mail at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information: • User name (for COPS Office grants)\n• First and last name\n• Vendor number\n• Grant number(s) to be added\nHow do we fill out the payment enrollment forms? If you are a new grantee to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on\nthe COPS Office website at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=100. Prior to accessing your grant funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 54 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Your agency must complete the “Payee/Company Information” section following the directions on the\nback of the form and also provide the grant number (printed on the award document)."

Next, your financial\ninstitution must complete the “Financial Institution Information” section and have the appropriate financial\nofficial sign the form. If you are already a COPS Office grantee, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form.

If you have any questions, or wish to verify your\nACH enrollment form information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you are\nrequired to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFRs) using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able\nto make drawdowns from your grant account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on\nfile with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Grantees are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via\nthe Internet at www.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see Section VI of this\nmanual, titled “Reports,” on page 64. Filing the FFR (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar quarter. However,\nto receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of minimum cash on hand applies to COPS Office grants. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment\nto ensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal grant funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the grantee • is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\n• maintains excess cash on hand;\n• does not adhere to the terms and conditions of the grant;\n• fails to submit reliable or timely reports. How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements. However, reimbursement\nis only for costs that were approved in the FCM. As a general guideline, most agencies request\nreimbursement on a monthly or quarterly basis. Also, please note that a date range can only be used once. 55 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Can we earn interest on our grant funds?"

Your agency should minimize the time between your drawdown of grant funds and your payment of grant\ncosts to avoid earning excess interest on your grant funds. You must account for interest earned on advances\nof federal funds as follows: • COPS grant award recipients must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(9) that states that interest\nearned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year may\nbe retained by the grantee for administrative expense. Interest earned on Federal advance payments\ndeposited in interest-bearing accounts in excess of $500 must be remitted annually to the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Make check payable to “The Department of Health and\nHuman Services” and mail check to Treasury-approved lockbox: HHS Program Support Center, P.O. Box\n530231, Atlanta, GA 30353-0231. (Please allow 4–6 weeks for processing of a payment by check to be\napplied to the appropriate Payment Management System (PMS) account). • Please notify your COPS Office Staff Accountant in the COPS Office Financial Division when any interest\nthat is earned is remitted to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management\nSystems, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. • For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified\nat 31 C.F.R. Part 205 “Rules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers” and TFM 4A–2000\nOverall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies. Matching funds\nUnder the 2015 COPS Office TRGP Programs, no local match is required. The COPS Office is funding 100\npercent of the allowable items approved in your FCM. (Any salary and benefit costs higher than entrylevel must be paid by your agency with local funds.) Please note: If the total cost exceeds the approved\nbudget, then the addition expenditures are encouraged to be reported on the SF-425 as recipient share of\nexpenditures. 56 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual IV. Financial Record Maintenance Your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately\naccount for grant funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include both federal funds and any\nlocal funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately\naccount for the funds awarded. As stated in 2 C.F.R. 200.62 (Internal Control over Compliance Requirements for Federal Awards), your\naccounting system should • present and itemize actual expenditures of funded items;\n• demonstrate that funds are spent in compliance with your grant conditions;\n• be able to provide the necessary information for periodic financial review and audit.

Your accounting records should contain\ninformation showing expenditures under the grant and must be supported by items such as cancelled\nchecks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard grant funds and make sure that they are used for authorized\npurposes only. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must documents be kept?

If your agency has more than one COPS Office grant or a grant from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization\nfrom the COPS Office, or, in the case of a grant from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your\naccounting systems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the\nComptroller General of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office\nmay access these records for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 58 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual V. Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your grant may be subject to an audit by independent\nexaminers. The two primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice\n(DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audits.

The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised June 27, 2003 and again\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003 to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The new Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 2 C.F.R. Part 200 — Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform\nGuidance) was effective on December 26, 2013, was implemented by federal agencies on the required\neffective date of December 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of\nSAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? A nonfederal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the nonfederal entity’s fiscal year in federal\nawards must have a single audit conducted in accordance with §200.514 Scope of audit except when it\nelects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. An\nauditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or a vendor. Specifically, “Federal awards expended as a recipient\nor a subrecipient are subject to audit under §200.501, Subpart F.”\nSAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute\nin effect on January 1, 1987 to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA\naudit is to express opinions on the grantee’s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major\ngrant programs, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address\nspecific compliance issues with respect to COPS Office grant requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part,\nfederal agencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in §200.338 “Remedies\nfor noncompliance.” These sanctions under §200.338 “Remedies for noncompliance” could include the\nfollowing: • Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or\nmore severe enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. • Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost\nof the activity or action not in compliance. • Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the federal award. • Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 CFR part 180 and federal awarding agency regulations (or in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding\nbe initiated by a federal awarding agency). • Withhold further federal awards for the project or program.\n• Take other remedies that may be legally available. 59 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Your Single Audit Act reports should not be sent to the COPS Office."

The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The primary objective of OIG audits is to assess compliance with grant conditions. OIG audits are designed to\npromote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of grants by evaluating compliance with\nlaws, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the operations encompassed in the scope of the audit. How are COPS Office grants selected for an OIG audit? The OIG may conduct a COPS Office grant audit in response to a referral that the OIG believes warrants\nfurther evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ agencies on an annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit\nareas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the OIG selects grants based on a number of\nfactors, including the geographical distribution of grants awarded, award amount, population served, and\ntype of grant (both active and expired). As such, the fact that your grant has been selected for an OIG audit is\nnot necessarily indicative of a suspected concern or problem area. The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division serves as the liaison between grantees and the OIG’s Audit\nDivision, which conducts the audit. After the OIG notifies the COPS Office of upcoming audits to be\nconducted, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Division will send out a notification letter to the grantee outlining\nthe scope of each audit and the anticipated audit timeframe. This notification letter also advises grantees\nof the supporting documentation required and information necessary for the OIG during their scheduled\nfield work and provides a COPS Office point of contact to address questions and concerns. If you have any\nquestions regarding an OIG audit, please contact the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division at 800-4216770. Questions and comments regarding the administration of your COPS Office grant not specifically\nrelated to an audit should be referred to your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. Typical audit findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to grants as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems: • unallowable costs."

Grantee incurred costs which were not approved in the original budget, were in\nexcess of the approved budget, or were charged to the grant after the expiration date and a grant\nextension was not obtained. • unsupported costs. Specific grant expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by\nadequate documentation, or grant expenditures were in excess of actual grant costs. • lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Grantee failed to submit required programmatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. 60 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual • failure to retain. Grantee lacked documentation to support retention planning efforts during the grant\nperiod or failed to demonstrate an increase in the baseline of locally funded sworn officer positions\nat the conclusion of the 36 months of federal funding, over and above what the grantee would have\nfunded in absence of the grant. • supplanting. Grantee could not document efforts to backfill vacant local sworn officer positions, or grantee could not explain reductions in local law enforcement budget during the grant award period. • lack of adequate community policing. Grantee had difficulty demonstrating community policing\nactivities. • funds to better use. Funds could be used more efficiently based on management actions such as\n• reductions in outlays;\n• deobligation of funds;\n• withdrawal;\n• costs not incurred by implementing recommended improvements;\n• any other savings which are specifically identified. • questioned costs. Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted from a violation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, grant terms and conditions, or\nother document governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable\nand do not reflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because\ncosts at the time of the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Division will continue working\nas the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The COPS Office\nwill issue a closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must keep all\ndocumentation related to the audit for a period of three years following the audit’s closure. 61 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual VI. Reports As part of the TRGP, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Program Progress Reports.

      "content": "Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report TRGP funding\nseparately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal grants) to ensure accurate\nfinancial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial\ninternal controls in place to monitor the use of TRGP funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the\ngrant terms and conditions. Good practices in this area include written accounting practices, an accounting\nsystem that tracks all drawdowns and grant expenditures, and the ability to track when each TRGP position\nis filled or vacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit complete reports,\nor submit them in a timely manner, may result in the suspension and possible termination of your agency’s COPS\nOffice grant funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the\nend of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the\nfunding period, and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official grant end date;\nhowever, you will have a 90-day grace period after the grant award end date during which you can draw\ndown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before the grant end date. How do we file a Federal Financial Report? All COPS Office grantees are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Grantees are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office website\nat www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the “Account Access” link in the upper right corner to log in; once you\nare logged in, select “Applications” from the agency portal menu, click on the “SF-425” icon, and follow\nthe instructions to complete and submit your reports. The online SF-425 requires the same reporting\ninformation as the paper version. The use of this online application enables authorized users to view past\nSF-425s, and allows them to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports due? SF-425s for COPS Office grants must be submitted every quarter and no later than 30 days after the last day\nof each reporting quarter, as detailed below:\nTable 1. Due dates of SF-425s by quarter\nReporting Quarters SF-425 Due Date January 1–March 31 April 30 April 1–June 30 July 30 July 1–September 30 October 30 October 1–December 31 January 30 For your first SF-425 submission, determine when the most recent SF-425 reporting quarter ended and\ncomplete an SF-425 to cover the period from the award start date of your grant to that particular end date. You are required to submit an SF-425 even if you have not spent any money or incurred any costs during a\nreporting period.

When the Grant Period Has Ended At the end of your agency’s TRGP grant period, the COPS Office is responsible for the closeout of your grant. As part of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation demonstrating that your agency has met all\nof the programmatic and financial requirements of the grant. After the end of the grant period, your agency will be asked to submit a final FFR and any applicable final\nprogram reports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final FFR (SF-425) for your grant is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after the end date of the\ngrant. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal expenditures that were incurred\nduring the life of the grant, as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. In addition, once\nyou have completed your final drawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of funds\ndrawn down by your agency. When should all of the grant monies be spent? Grant funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the grant period. Obligated funds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency\nhas incurred but not yet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the grant period to request\nreimbursement for funds obligated. Please be advised that 2 C.F.R. Part 200.343(a) requires grantees to submit final SF-425s and 2 C.F.R. Part 200.343(b)\nrequires grantees to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration\nof the grant. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess grant funds remaining in your account following the grant\nperiod due to an overestimate of item costs during the grant period. Your agency should review its records\ncarefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred\nduring the grant period. Any excess unobligated or unspent funds should remain in your account, and will\nbe deobligated during the closeout process. Final Program Progress (Closeout) Report After your grant period has ended, your agency may be sent a final progress or closeout report from the\nCOPS Office and asked to complete it. This report will serve as your agency’s final programmatic report on\nthe grant, and the information your agency provides in this report will be used to make a final assessment of\nyour grant progress."

Community policing defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use\nof partnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give\nrise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. Community policing comprises three key components:\n1. Community partnerships 2. Organizational transformation 3. Problem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between the law enforcement agency and the\nindividuals and organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages\ninteractive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems\nthrough collaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in\nprioritizing and addressing public safety problems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and\nschools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community—volunteers, activists, formal\nand informal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters—are a valuable resource\nfor identifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific\ngoals at town hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the\ncommunity, and team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncommon interests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue\ngroups, advocacy groups, community development corporations, and the faith community. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners\nbecause they often bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own\nsecurity technology and community outreach."

Businesses can help identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own\nsecurity technology and community outreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can\nalso assist in disseminating information about police and business partnerships and initiatives, and crime\nprevention practices. 73 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can\nassist with publicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government\nor community agencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a\nsignificant impact on public perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way departments are organized and managed and\nhow the infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It\nencourages the application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing emphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and\ninfuse it throughout the entire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel,\nand its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management diffuses community policing ideals throughout\nthe agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor\nrelations, decentralized decision making and accountability, strategic planning, policies and procedures,\norganizational evaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture Changing the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values\nsystematic problem solving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal\nnetworks and communication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership Leaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to\nimplement community policing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing’s vision, values, and\nmission within their organization and support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the\npredominant way of doing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized\nlabor must be a part of the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing\nphilosophy. Including labor groups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are\nimperative to community policing implementation. Decision making Community policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decisionmaking. Decentralized decision-making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in\ncommunity policing. When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she\nultimately feels accountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of\nthe community."

When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she\nultimately feels accountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of\nthe community. Decentralized decision-making involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing\ntolerance for risk-taking in problem-solving efforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In\naddition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various resources to attack a problem and allowing\nofficers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community will help define problems and develop\npossible solutions. 74 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide\ncommitment to community policing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and\nexpertise. If a strategic plan is to have value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it\nand be able to give examples of their efforts supporting the plan. Components such as the organization’s\nmission and values statement should be simple and communicated widely. Policies Community policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to\nensure that community policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem\nsolving and partnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding\nsets of procedures, where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response\ntimes, tickets issued, and crime rates), community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome\nmeasures to include such things as greater community satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of\nproblems, and improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to\nevaluation—one that looks at how feedback information is used, not only how outcomes are measured. Transparency Community policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional\npolicing. If the community is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing\nrelevant information on crime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local\npatrol officers have decision-making authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved\nthrough long-term assignments, the development of officers who are generalists and using special units\nappropriately. Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment\nof officers to specific neighborhoods or areas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance customer\nservice and facilitate more contact between police and citizens, thus establishing a strong relationship\nand mutual accountability. Beat boundaries should correspond to neighborhood boundaries and other\ngovernment services should recognize these boundaries when coordinating government public-service\nactivities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers have to be able to handle multiple\nresponsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the\ncommunity. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just in special units, although\nthere may be a need for some specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly\ncomplex problems or managing complex partnerships."

Resources and finances Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources to support\ncommunity policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained\nand effective. 75 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Personnel The principles of community policing need to be diffused throughout the entire personnel system of an\nagency including recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from\nsworn officers to civilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be\naligned with the agencies’ community policing values. Recruitment, hiring, and selection Agencies need a systematic means of incorporating community\npolicing elements into their recruitment, selection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize\ncommunity policing and problem-solving responsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers\nwho have a spirit of service, instead of only a spirit of adventure. A community policing agency must also\nthoughtfully examine where it is seeking recruits, whom it is recruiting and hiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community involvement in this process through the identification of\ncompetencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations Supervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing\nprinciples and activities that are incorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional\nprocedures should support sound problem-solving activities, proactive policing, community collaboration,\nand citizen satisfaction with police services. Training Training at all levels—academy, field, and in-service—must support community policing principles\nand tactics. It also needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and\nanalytical skills, and techniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers\ncan be trained to identify and correct conditions that could lead to crime, to raise public awareness, and\nto engage the community in finding solutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to\nlearn how to encourage problem solving and help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until\ncommunity policing is institutionalized in the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to\ntake place regularly. Information systems (technology) Community policing is information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in helping to provide ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with improving two-way communication with citizens and in\ndeveloping agency accountability systems and performance outcome measures. Communication/access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to\ncommunicate externally with the public and internally with their own staff. To communicate with the\npublic, community policing encourages agencies to develop two-way communication systems through\nthe Internet that allow for online reports, reverse 911 and e-mail alerts, discussion forums, and feedback on\ninteractive applications (surveys, maps), thereby creating ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters,\ne-mail and enhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with\nother entities for more efficient operations."

Community policing also encourages the use of technology to\ndevelop accountability and performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics\nand a broad array of measures and information. 76 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely\ninformation on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers\nin their patrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem\nanalysis functions by enabling agencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime\nlocations, and quality-of-life concerns, and to further enhance analysis. SAFECOM Guidance The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Emergency Communications, in\ncoordination with various stakeholder groups, develops the annual SAFECOM Guidance on Emergency\nCommunications Grants. The guidance provides recommendations to grantees seeking funding for\ninteroperable emergency communications projects, including allowable costs, items to consider when\nfunding emergency communications projects, grants management best practices for emergency\ncommunications grants, and information on standards that ensure greater interoperability. The guidance\nis intended to ensure that federally funded investments are compatible and support national goals and\nobjectives for improving interoperability nationwide. Grantees (including sub-grantees) that are using\nTRGP funds to support emergency communications activities should comply with the latest version of\nSAFECOM Guidance, including provisions on technical standards that ensure and enhance interoperable\ncommunications. The most recent version of SAFECOM Guidance is available at: www.safecomprogram. gov/grant/Default.aspx. Quality and accuracy of data Information is only as good as its source, and therefore it is not useful if it is of\nquestionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to\nensure that information from various sources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central\nsystems that are linked to one another and checked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for\nstrategic planning, problem solving, and performance measurement. Problem solving\nProblem solving is the process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified\nproblems to develop and evaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving\nmust be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to\nthink innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential\nresponses. A major conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured\nand disciplined way is the SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine\nthe scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase."

An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more\nincidents that are similar in one or more ways and that are of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of\nany of these. The police, with input from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. 77 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses,\nestablish correlation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is\nimportant to find out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?,\nwhen?, where?, how?, why?, and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem. The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem or reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the\nproblem declined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the\ncurrent effort but also gathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be\nassessed for process, outcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information\ngathered during analysis should be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new\nsolutions can be developed and tested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear,\nmeaning that additional scanning, analysis, or responses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for\nexample, capable guardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders\n(e.g., parents, friends, and probation officers), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park\nemployees, and motel clerks)."

Appendix D. National Institute of Justice (NIJ) bulletproof vest standards The following information was adapted from NIJ Guide 100-98, “Selection and Application Guide to Police\nBody Armor.” The publication in its entirety may be requested from:\nNational Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center (NLECTC)\n2277 Research Boulevard\nRockville, MD 20850\n800-248-2742 The publication may also be downloaded from the Center’s website: www.justnet.org/Pages/home.aspx. “NIJ’s policy on body armor has always been that preserving the life of the police officer\nis the sole criteria on which to judge body armor effectiveness. At present, an officer may\nselect a garment that corresponds to an appropriate threat level and be confident that\narmor in compliance with NIJ’s standard will defeat the stated threat level.” 78 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Type I (.22 LR; .38 Special) Type I body armor is light. This is the minimum level of protection every officer should have, and the armor\nshould be routinely worn at all times while on duty. Type I body armor was the armor issued during the NIJ\ndemonstration project in the mid-1970s. Most agencies today, however, because of increasing threats, opt\nfor a higher level of protection. This armor protects against .22 long rifle high-velocity lead bullets, with nominal masses of 2.6 g (40 gr),\nimpacting at a velocity of 320 m/s (1,050 ft/s) or less, and against .38 special round-nose lead bullets, with\nnominal masses of 10.2 g (158 gr), impacting at a velocity of 259 m/s (850 ft/s) or less. It also provides\nprotection against most other .25 and .32 caliber handgun rounds. Type II-A (lower velocity .357 Magnum; 9mm)\nType II-A body armor is well suited for full-time use by police departments, particularly those seeking\nprotection for their officers from lower velocity .357 Magnum and 9mm ammunition. This armor protects against .357 Magnum jacketed soft-point bullets, with nominal masses of 10.2 g (158\ngr), impacting at a velocity of 381 m/s (1,250 ft/s) or less, and against 9mm full-metal jacketed bullets, with\nnominal masses of 8.0 g (124 gr), impacting at a velocity of 332 m/s (1,175 ft/s). It also protects against such\nthreats as .45 auto., .38 special +P, and some other factory loads in caliber .357 Magnum and 9mm as well as\nthe Type I threats. Type II (higher velocity .357 Magnum; 9mm)\nType II body armor is heavier and bulkier than either Types I or II-A. It is worn full-time by officers seeking\nprotection against higher velocity .357 Magnum and 9mm ammunition. This armor protects against .357 Magnum jacketed soft-point bullets, with nominal masses of 10.2 g (158 gr),\nimpacting at a velocity of 425 m/s (1,395 ft/s) or less, and against 9mm full-jacketed bullets, with nominal\nvelocities of 358 m/s (1,175 ft/s). It also protects against most other factory loads in caliber .357 Magnum and\n9mm as well as the Type I and II-A threats."

Type III-A (.44 Magnum; submachine gun 9mm) Type III-A body armor provides the highest level of protection currently available from concealable body\narmor and is generally suitable for routine wear in many situations. However, departments located in hot,\nhumid climates may need to evaluate the use of Type III-A armor carefully. This armor protects against .44 Magnum lead semi-wadcutter bullets with gas checks, nominal masses of\n15.55 g (240 gr), impacting at a velocity of 426 m/s (1,400 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against\nmost handgun threats as well as the Type I, II-A, and II threats. Type III (high-powered rifle) Type III body armor is clearly intended only for tactical situations when the threat warrants such protection,\nsuch as barricade confrontations involving sporting rifles. This armor, normally of hard or semi-rigid construction, protects against 7.62 mm full-metal jacketed bullets\n(U.S. military designation M80), with nominal masses of 9.7 g (150 gr), impacting at a velocity of 838 m/s\n(2,750 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against threats such as 223 Remington (5.56 mm FMJ), 30\nCarbine FMJ, and 12-gauge rifled slug, as well as the Type I through III-A threats. 79 2015 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner’s Manual Type IV (armor-piercing rifle) Type IV body armor provides the highest level of protection currently available. Because this armor is intended\nto resist armor piercing bullets, it often uses ceramic materials. Such materials are brittle in nature and may\nprovide only single-shot protection, since the ceramic tends to break up when struck. As with Type III armor,\nType IV armor is clearly intended only for tactical situations when the threats warrant such protection. This armor protects against .30-06 caliber armor-piercing bullets (U.S. military designation AMP2), with\nnominal masses of 10.8 g (166 gr), impacting at a velocity of 868 m/s (2,850 ft/s) or less. It also provides at\nleast single-hit protection against the Type I through III threats. Special type\nA purchaser who has a special requirement for a level of protection other than one of the above standard\nthreat levels should specify the exact test rounds and minimum impact velocities to be used and indicate\nthat this standard shall govern in all other respects.
