The\nentire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear, meaning that additional scanning, analysis, or\nresponses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim, offender,\nand location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for example, capable\nguardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders (e.g., parents, friends,\nand probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees, and motel clerks). Rather\nthan focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the police focus on the factors that are within\ntheir reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating\nrisk with unwanted behavior.
