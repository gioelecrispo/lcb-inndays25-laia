  "chunk_text": "What you should do:\nPlease read the entire CAMP Award Owner’s Manual carefully prior to signing the award document. If you have\nany questions, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. When accepting your award, you should\nensure that the proper reporting and financial systems are in place to satisfy the award requirements. 2. Assurances and Certifications\nCondition: The recipient acknowledges its agreement to comply with the Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed\nas part of its application. Why this condition:\nAlthough the COPS Office has made every effort to simplify the process of applying for and receiving awards,\nseveral provisions of federal law require us to seek the recipient’s signed Assurances and Certifications regarding\ncertain matters. Most of the Assurances and Certifications apply to all federal award programs. What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS Office award programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at the time\nof application and application update. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have read,\nunderstood, and accepted the award terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications. Please\nread these documents carefully as signatures on these documents are treated as a material representation of fact\nupon which reliance was placed when the US Department of Justice determined whether to fund the covered\naward. Additional copies of the Assurances and Certifications forms are contained in the appendices of this\nmanual. If you have any questions about them, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist via the\nCOPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. 3. Allowable costs\nCondition: The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs for activities related to the establishment and\nenhancement of a variety of problem-solving strategies to investigate methamphetamine problems in your\njurisdiction. The allowable costs for which your agency’s award has been approved are limited to those listed on the\nFinancial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which is included in your agency’s award package. The FCM specifies the\ncosts that your agency is allowed to fund with your CAMP award, and specifies the overall amount approved for\neach budget request category. Your agency may not use CAMP award funds for any costs that are not identified\nas allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual allowable costs incurred during the award\n4 2017 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown. If your agency experiences any cost savings over the\ncourse of the award (for example, your award application overestimated the total entry-level officer salary and\nfringe benefits package), your agency may not use that excess funding to extend the length of the award beyond 24\nmonths. Any funds remaining after your agency has drawn down for the costs approved during the 24 month\nfunding period will be deobligated during the closeout process and should not be spent by your agency. Why this condition: The funding under this project is for the purchase of items and services approved by the COPS Office as reflected in\nthe Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM)."
