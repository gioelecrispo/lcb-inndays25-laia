In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance to help\nensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards. 42 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency’s use of federal funds both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients’ compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to conduct\nsite visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is three-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions on how to prepare\nfor the review of their COPS Office awards. The site visit is generally performed over a period of one or\nmore days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while onsite, or if necessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will have an opportunity to seek\ncustomer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an EOBGR\nconducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative for\nconducting site visit reviews in support of the COPS Office’s overall award monitoring strategy. The purpose of\nthe EOBGR is three-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient’s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one to two day period. Compliance reviews will be conducted for\nactive awards to address any noncompliance and/or administrative issues identified during the review. In\naddition, award recipients will also receive customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a noncompliance\nissue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media,\ncitizens, law enforcement agencies, other federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case basis,\nCOPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints\nof alleged noncompliance."
