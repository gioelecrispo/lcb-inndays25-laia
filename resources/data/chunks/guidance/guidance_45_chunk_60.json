  "chunk_text": "Federal Financial Reports Your organization is required to submit a quarterly Federal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end\nof the award period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding\nperiod and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your organization is not\npermitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however, you will\nhave a 90-day grace period after the award end date during which you can draw down funds for eligible\nexpenditures incurred before the award end date. How do we file Federal Financial Reports? All COPS Office award recipients are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Recipients are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office Agency Portal\nwebsite at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov to log in; once you are logged in, select “Applications” from the agency\nportal menu, click on the “SF-425” icon, and follow the instructions to complete and submit your reports. The\nonline SF-425 requires the same reporting information as the paper version. The use of this online application\nenables authorized users to view past reports and allows them to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. Please see the Agency Portal User Manual at https://cops.usdoj.gov/lemhwa#programdocuments for detailed\ninstructions on federal financial reports.
