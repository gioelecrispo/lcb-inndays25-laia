Custody classification is a procedure whereby an\ninmate is assigned a level of supervision according to their\ncriminal history and institutional behavior/adjustment. An\ninmate’s custody level is an indication of how much staff\nsupervision an inmate requires within and beyond the confines\nof the institution. An inmate’s first custody classification will be scored at the\nfirst program review following initial classification\n(approximately 7 months after arrival at an institution). Subsequent reviews will occur at least every 12 months, but\nmay be conducted earlier in order to enable progress toward\ncommunity activities. Custody classification will ordinarily\noccur every 12 months at a regularly scheduled program review. Only changes\nwhich increase or decrease the overall security level\nassignment of the inmate, i.e. FRP refuse, incident report(s),\nnew sentence, sentence reduction etc., should be scored outside\nof the 12 month cycle."
