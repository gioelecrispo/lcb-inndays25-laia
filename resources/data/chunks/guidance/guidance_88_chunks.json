Lobbying, Debarment and Drug-Free Workplace In order to comply with the certification and assurance requirements provided in the\ncommon rules for lobbying, drug-free workplace, and suspension and debarment (so\nthat recipients do not have to sign three certifications), they have been combined into\nOJP Form 4061/6, entitled “Certifications Regarding Lobbying; Debarment, Suspension\nand Other Responsibility Matters; and Drug-Free Workplace Requirements”. Lobbying Certification - This certification must be submitted prior to recommendation for\nor against an award. U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) codification of the governmentwide common rule for restrictions on lobbying, 28 CFR Part 69, provides guidance on\nrequirements that recipients shall meet in order to receive Federal funds. (See also\ndiscussion on Lobbying; Part III: Post Award Requirements, Chapter 16: Unallowable\nCosts). The following restrictions on lobbying are applicable to all recipients and subrecipients\n(in addition to the restrictions imposed by recent revisions to 18 United States Code\n[U.S.C.] 1913). Interim Final Guidance for New Restrictions on Lobbying was published\nin the Federal Register in December 1989. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995\nincluded amendments that have an impact on the guidance provided in 1989. Per 31\nU.S.C. 1352, the restrictions on lobbying are as follows: 2014 Version Page 17  No federally appropriated funds may be expended by the recipient of a\nFederal award, cooperative agreement, or contract to pay a person for\ninfluencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a\nmember of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of\na member of Congress in connection with any of the following covered\nFederal actions: the awarding of any Federal contract; the making of any\nFederal grant; the entering into of any cooperative agreement; and the\nextension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any Federal\ncontract, grant, or cooperative agreement.  Each person who requests or receives from an agency an initial Federal\ncontract, award, or cooperative agreement (including subcontracts,\nsubawards, and contracts under cooperative agreements) exceeding\n$100,000 shall file with that agency a certification regarding lobbying. The\ncertification shall be submitted to the agency making the award. Each person\nis certifying that:\no He/she has not made and will not make any payment for a lobbying\nactivity. o If any non-Federal funds have been paid or will be paid to any person,\nhe/she will complete and submit a “Disclosure of Lobbying Activities”\nform (Disclosure Form). o The language of this certification will be included in his/her award\ndocuments for all subawards at all tiers (including subcontracts,\nsubawards and contracts under awards, and cooperative\nagreements), and all subrecipients shall certify and disclose\naccordingly. o Each person, if applicable, shall submit the Disclosure Form to the\nagency making the award. The recipient or subrecipient is responsible\nfor reporting lobbying activities of its employees if the employee’s\ntenure is less than 130 working days within 1 year immediately\npreceding the date of the recipient’s or subrecipient’s application or\nproposal submission. o"

All certifications shall\nbe maintained by the agency making the award and all Disclosure\nForms shall be forwarded from tier to tier until received by the Federal\nagency making the award. That agency shall forward all Disclosure\nForms to the awarding agency. The Disclosure Form shall contain the\nfollowing information:\n Name and address of reporting entity;\n Federal program name;\n Federal award number;\n Federal award amount; and\n Name and address of lobbying registrant.  Each person shall file a Disclosure Form at the end of each calendar quarter\nin which there occurs any event that requires disclosure or that materially\naffects the accuracy of the information contained in any Disclosure Form\npreviously filed by such persons. Examples of such events are: 2014 Version Page 18 o\no\no\no A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or\nexpected to be paid for influencing or attempting to influence a\ncovered Federal action;\nA change in the person(s) or individual(s) influencing or attempting to\ninfluence a covered Federal action; or\nA change in the officer(s), employee(s), or member(s) contacted to\ninfluence or attempt to influence a covered Federal action. Penalties and enforcement of lobbying restrictions shall be as follows:\n Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited by the New\nRestrictions on Lobbying shall be subject to a civil penalty of\nnot less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each\nsuch expenditure.\n Any person who fails to file or amend the Disclosure Form to\nbe filed or amended, if required, shall be subject to a civil\npenalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000\nfor each such failure. In summary, the common rule for lobbying requires that recipients and their\nsubrecipients certify they will comply with the lobbying common rule. This requirement is\nonly for awards exceeding $100,000. (See Part III, Chapter 16: Unallowable Costs, for\ncost restrictions relating to lobbying). Debarment and Suspension Certification - This certification must be completed prior to\nrecommendation for or against an award. The government-wide common rule for\ndebarment and suspension, 2 CFR 180, provides guidance on requirements that\nrecipients shall meet in order to receive Federal funds. DOJ’s implementation of the\ncommon rule is found at 2 CFR 2867. 1) Title 2 of the CFR Part 180 provides that executive departments and agencies\nshall participate in a system for debarment and suspension from programs and\nactivities involving Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a program by one agency has\ngovernment-wide effect. It is the policy of the Federal Government to conduct\nbusiness only with responsible persons, and these guidelines will assist agencies\nin carrying out this policy. 2) Most grantees will use OJP Form 4061/6."

This requirement includes persons, corporations, etc., that have critical influence\non or substantive control over the award. The direct recipient will be responsible\nfor monitoring the submission and maintaining the official subrecipient\ncertifications. 2014 Version Page 19 In summary, the debarment and suspension common rule requires that both recipients\nand their subrecipients certify they will comply with the debarment and suspension\ncommon rule. Subcontractors are not required to certify if their subaward is less than\n$100,000. Drug-Free Workplace Certification - This certification must be submitted prior to\nrecommendation for or against an award. The government-wide common rule for drugfree workplace, 28 CFR Part 83, provides guidance on requirements that recipients shall\nmeet in order to receive Federal funds. 28 CFR Part 83 implements the statutory requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act\nof 1988. All recipients receiving awards from any Federal agency shall certify to that\nagency that they will maintain a drug-free workplace. A recipient who is an individual\nshall certify to the agency that his or her conduct of award activity will be drug free. If a\nrecipient makes a false certification, the recipient is subject to suspension, termination,\nand debarment. 1) The State agency responsible for administering the block/formula award shall\nsubmit a drug-free workplace certification to the awarding agency and shall be\nresponsible for obtaining a drug-free workplace certification from each State\nagency that is subawarded funds. Subrecipients that are not State agencies are\nnot required to submit a drug-free workplace certification. 2) A recipient is required to make the required certification for each award. The one\nexception to this rule is that a recipient which is a State, including a State\nagency, may elect to make a single annual certification to each awarding agency\nfrom which it obtains awards, rather than making a separate certification for each\naward or workplace. Only one such annual certification needs to be made to\neach Federal agency which will cover all of that State agency’s workplaces. 3) There are two different certifications: one for individuals and one for\norganizations. The individual recipient certifies that he or she will not engage in\nthe unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a\ncontrolled substance in conducting any activity with the award."

The individual recipient certifies that he or she will not engage in\nthe unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a\ncontrolled substance in conducting any activity with the award. The\norganizational recipient certifies that it will provide a drug-free workplace by:\na) Publishing a statement notifying employees that the unlawful manufacture,\ndistribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is\nprohibited in the recipient’s workplace and specifying the actions that will be\ntaken against employees for violation of such prohibition. b) Establishing a drug-free awareness program to inform employees about:\ni) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;\nii) The recipient’s policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;\niii) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance\nprograms; and\niv) The penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse\nviolations occurring in the workplace. c) Making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the\nperformance of the award be given a copy of the employer’s statement about\ndrugs in the workplace. 2014 Version Page 20 d) Notifying the employee that, as a condition of employment under the award,\nthe employee will:\ni) Abide by the terms of the statement; and\nii) Notify the employer of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation\noccurring in the workplace not later than 5 calendar days after such\nconviction. e) Notifying the awarding agency within 10 calendar days after receiving notice\nfrom an employee or otherwise receiving actual notice of such conviction. f) Taking one of the following actions, within 30 calendar days of receiving\nnotice, with respect to any employee who is so convicted:\ni) Taking appropriate personnel action against such an employee, up to and\nincluding termination; or\nii) Requiring such employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse\nassistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a\nFederal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate\nagency. g) Making a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug-free workplace. In summary, the drug-free workplace common rule requires that ONLY direct recipients\nof Federal awards certify they will comply with the drug-free workplace common rule. There is no dollar threshold for certification. Standard Assurances An authorized representative of the applicant organization must also assure and certify\ncompliance with all applicable Federal statutes, regulations, policies, guidelines, and\nrequirements outlined in the Standard Assurances (OMB Approval # 1121-0140).

Nonprofit Organization Requirements Any entity under the Tribal Coalitions, Underserved, TSASP, SASP CSS, Arrest,\nDisability, Elder, JFF, and LAV (tribal nonprofits only) Programs that is eligible for OVW\nfunding based on its status as a nonprofit organization must be an organization that is\ndescribed in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from\ntaxation under section 501(a) of that Code. See 42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(16)(B). Any\nnonprofit organization that holds money in offshore accounts for the purpose of avoiding\npaying the tax described in section 511(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is not eligible\nfor a grant from OVW. Any OVW applicant that is a nonprofit organization that uses the Internal Revenue\nService's three-step safe-harbor procedure for establishing a rebuttable presumption that\nits executives' compensation is reasonable, must provide certain information in the\napplication, specifically: (1) a brief description of the process used for determining the\ncompensation of its officers, directors, trustees, and key employees, including the\nindependent persons involved in reviewing and approving such compensation (in lieu of\na description, an applicant may submit its written compensation policy); (2) the\ncomparability data used in establishing executive compensation; and (3)\ncontemporaneous substantiation of the deliberation and decision regarding executive\ncompensation. This third element can usually be addressed by submitting minutes from\nboard meetings where compensation was considered and approved. Applicants that want to learn about best practices for establishing compensation for their\nexecutives and the IRS's safe-harbor procedures can find more information through the\nNational Council of Nonprofits, http://www.councilofnonprofits.org/nonprofit-executivecompensation-policy. 2014 Version Page 22 Chapter 2: Application Review\nHIGHLIGHTS OF CHAPTER:\nReview of Application for Federal Assistance (SF 424)\nFinancial Analysis\nOVW is required to review applications in order to assure that awards issued meet\ncertain legislative, regulatory, and administrative requirements. OVW follows the\nrequirements stipulated in the administrative requirements for grants and agreements\nthat are codified at 28 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 66 and 70. REVIEW OF APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE (SF 424)\nAn examination of the Application for Federal Assistance (SF-424) is conducted to\ndetermine:\n1. Type of Applicant – This information is used to determine eligibility for the\nprogram. Examples include State Government, Individual, Not-for-profit\nwith 501C3 Status or Private Institution of Higher Education. 2. Legal Name – This legal name is reviewed and used to determine if the\napplicant organization is a current DOJ recipient or a new applicant. 3. Organizational DUNS – OVW verifies that the applicant’s DUNS is\nregistered and active within SAM.gov and the organization’s registration\nmatches the application and DOJ records (for current recipients)."

Address –The address is reviewed together with the Legal Name and\nDUNS number to determine if the applicant is a current DOJ grantee or a\nnew applicant. 5. EIN/Vendor No. – If it is determined that the applicant organization is a\nnew applicant, then in coordination with OJP, OVW will assign the\norganization an “OJP Vendor Number” for administrative purposes only. This number is used to track awards, payments, and reports in DOJ’s\naccounting and grant systems. The OJP Vendor Number can be found on\nthe grant award document in box 1A and may or may not match the\norganization’s EIN. 6. Applicant Federal Debt (OMB Circular A-129) - OVW holds recipients\naccountable for any overpayment, audit disallowances, or any other\nbreach of award that results in a debt owed to the Federal Government. The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 states that if, after written\nnotification, grantee payments continue to be delinquent, the debt will be\nreferred to a collection agency or Department of the Treasury for further\naction. The awarding agency shall apply interest, penalties, and\nadministrative costs to a delinquent debt owed by a debtor pursuant to\nthe Federal Claims Collection Standards and OMB Circular A-129,\nPolicies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables. The SF424 includes a question about whether there is Federal debt. That\nquestion applies to the organization requesting the financial assistance,\nnot the person who signs the application as the authorized representative\nof the organization. Categories of debt include delinquent audit\ndisallowances, loans, and taxes. 2014 Version Page 23 7. Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs - If the State has\nestablished a process for the review of Federal programs and activities\neligible under Executive Order 12372 and a particular program has been\nselected for review by the State, applicants for the program must submit a\ncopy of their application to the State “single point of contact” (SPOC) prior\nto or at the same time that the application is submitted to OVW. Information on the Intergovernmental Review (SPOC List) may be found\nat http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants_spoc. 8. Authorized Representative - OVW verifies that the individual listed as the\nAuthorized Representative on the application is authorized to apply for\nand accept awards on behalf of the applicant organization. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS\nOVW’s policy is to provide assurance that awards are only for allowable, allocable,\nnecessary and reasonable costs. Applicants must possess the responsibility, financial\nmanagement, fiscal integrity, and financial capability necessary to adequately and\nappropriately administer Federal funds. The analysis of project applications includes:\n1. Budget Review –\na. Perform a cost analysis of the project budget included in the application\nthat is under consideration for funding by OVW. Cost analysis includes\nobtaining cost breakdowns, verifying cost data, and evaluating specific\nitems of cost to determine the necessity, reasonableness, allowability,\nallocability, and appropriateness of the proposed cost as it relates to the\nproposed project. The form and extent of such an analysis will be\ndetermined by OVW."

Verify that programmatic budgetary requirements have been met (for\nexample, OVW-mandated training and technical assistance costs have\nbeen included in the budget). d. If applicable, verify current indirect cost rate agreement is approved for\nuse on Federal assistance awards. If an applicant has budgeted for\nindirect costs but does not have an approved rate, they must submit an\nindirect cost proposal to their cognizant Federal agency. 2. Financial Capability – Determine the adequacy of the applicant’s accounting\nsystem and operations to ensure that Federal funds, if awarded, will be\nexpended in a judicious manner. This information is used by OVW to assess the\napplicant’s ability to appropriately manage OVW funds. a. Applicants are required to respond to the Financial Accounting Practices\nquestions, as instructed in the individual program solicitations. b. When the applicant is a nonprofit, nongovernmental entity and has had no\ngrant history with OVW or the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) within the\nlast three years, an Accounting System and Financial Capability\nQuestionnaire must be completed by the applicant and submitted along\nwith a copy of the organization’s most recent financial statements. c. Review A-133 Data Collection Forms to determine audit opinion and/or\napplicable audit findings. 2014 Version Page 24 3. Fiscal Integrity - Determine that the applicant organization has a history of\nresponsible handling of Federal funds. a. Verify timely submissions of the Federal Financial Report (FFR or\nStandard Form 425)\nb. Verify compliance with government-wide audit requirements (if\napplicable). c. Verify timely submission of programmatic/progress reports. 4.

Appropriated funds are thereby reserved against the award until all monies are\nexpended by the recipient and subrecipient or, in the case of non-utilization of funds\nwithin statutory or other time limits, appropriated funds would revert to OVW through\ndeobligation of the unused balance. On the award date, the award recipient is notified of award approval. Once the award\nhas been accepted, in order to receive payment of funds, the recipient must be in\ncompliance with award conditions enumerated in the award document. In addition, they\nmust be in compliance with all reporting requirements. All grantees are required to\nsubmit Federal Financial Reports (SF-425) for each grant on a quarterly basis for the life\nof the grant.

Grants and cooperative agreements are used when the primary purpose is to\naccomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.

These records shall include\nboth Federal funds and all matching funds of State, local, and private organizations,\nwhen applicable. State recipients shall expend and account for grant funds in\naccordance with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for their own\nfunds. Subrecipients of States shall follow the financial management requirements\nimposed on them by States, which must comply with the requirements OVW has\nimposed on the States. Funds specifically budgeted and/or received for one project may not be used to support\nanother project. Where a recipient’s or subrecipient’s accounting system cannot comply\nwith this requirement, the recipient or subrecipient shall establish a system to provide\nadequate fund accountability for each project it has been awarded. Where the performance of a program or one of its components is delegated to a\nsubrecipient, the direct recipient is responsible for all aspects of the program, including\nproper accounting and financial recordkeeping by the subrecipient. Responsibilities\ninclude the accounting of receipts and expenditures, cash management, maintenance of\nadequate financial records, and refunding expenditures disallowed by audits. TOTAL COST BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING Accounting for all funds awarded by the Federal agency shall be structured and\nexecuted on a “total program cost” basis. That is, total program costs, including Federal\nfunds, State and local matching shares, and any other fund sources included in the\napproved project budget or received as program income shall be the foundation for fiscal\nadministration, accounting, and audit.

However, recipients must be able to account\nfor the receipt, obligation, and expenditure of funds awarded on an individual basis. Grant funds must be tracked and accounted for separately from each OVW award as\nwell as other Federal agency awards. Funds specifically budgeted and/or received for\none project may not be used to support another project. Where a recipient’s or\nsubrecipient’s accounting system cannot comply with this requirement, the recipient or\nsubrecipient shall establish a system to provide adequate fund accountability for each\nproject it has been awarded. RECIPIENT AND SUBRECIPIENT ACCOUNTING RESPONSIBILITIES Where the performance of a program or one of its components is delegated to a\nsubrecipient, the direct recipient is responsible for all aspects of the program including\nproper accounting and financial recordkeeping by the subrecipient. Responsibilities\ninclude the accounting of receipts and expenditures, cash management, the maintaining\nof adequate financial records, and the refunding of expenditures disallowed by audits. 1) Reviewing Financial Operations - Direct recipients should be familiar with, and\nperiodically monitor, their subrecipients’ financial operations, records, systems,\nand procedures. Particular attention should be directed to the maintenance of\ncurrent financial data. 2) Recording Financial Activities - The subrecipient’s award or contract obligation,\nas well as cash advances and other financial activities, should be recorded in the\nbooks of the recipient in summary form. Subrecipient expenditures should be\nrecorded on the books of the recipient or evidenced by report forms duly filed by\nthe subrecipient. Non-Federal contributions applied to programs or projects by\nsubrecipients should likewise be recorded, as should any program income\nresulting from program operations. 3) Budgeting and Budget Review - The recipient should ensure that each\nsubrecipient prepares an adequate budget on which its award commitment will\nbe based. The detail of each project budget should be maintained on file by the\nrecipient. The recipient should track actual costs compared to budgeted costs\nthroughout the grant period. 4) Accounting for Non-Federal Contributions - Recipients will ensure that the\nrequirements, limitations, and regulations pertinent to non-Federal contributions\nare applied. 5) Audit Requirements - Recipients must ensure that subrecipients have met the\nnecessary audit requirements contained in this Guide (see Part IV, Chapter 2:\nAudit Requirements). 6) Reporting Irregularities - Recipients and their subrecipients are responsible for\npromptly notifying OVW, the OIG, and the Federal cognizant audit agency of any\n2014 Version Page 31 illegal acts, irregularities and/or proposed and actual improper actions. Please\nnotify GFMD at 1–888-514-8556 if any irregularities occur. Illegal acts and\nirregularities include conflicts of interest, falsification of records or reports, and\nmisappropriation of funds or other assets. 7) Debarred and Suspended Organizations - Recipients and subrecipients must not\naward or permit any award at any level to any party which is debarred or\nsuspended from participation in Federal assistance programs. Excluded or\ndisqualified individuals and organizations can be found at www.sam.gov."

For\ndetails regarding debarment procedures, see 2 CFR 180, Government-wide\nDebarment and Suspension (Nonprocurement) and see 2 CFR 2867 for DOJspecific requirements. 8) Bonding – OVW may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where a recipient\nlacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government interest (see 2 CFR\n215.21(d)). SUPPLANTING Federal funds must be used to supplement existing funds for program activities and\nmust not replace those funds that have been appropriated for the same purpose. Supplanting will be the subject of application review, as well as preaward review,\npostaward monitoring, and audit. If there is a potential presence of supplanting, the\napplicant or grantee will be required to supply documentation demonstrating that the\nreduction in non-Federal resources occurred for reasons other than the receipt or\nexpected receipt of Federal funds. For certain programs, a written certification may be\nrequested by OVW or recipient agency stating that Federal funds will not be used to\nsupplant non-Federal funds. 2014 Version Page 32 Chapter 2: Payments\nHIGHLIGHTS OF CHAPTER:\nPayment Method\nWithholding of Funds\nCash Management Improvement Act of 1990\nInterest Earned PAYMENT METHOD\nOVW’s direct grant recipients use OJP’s Grant Payment Request System (GPRS) to\nsubmit payment requests. Grantees must be registered as an FPOC in GMS at\nhttps://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov before they can register as a drawdown specialist in GPRS. Grantees can access GPRS at https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs. Payments are\nelectronically deposited to the recipient’s account by the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury using banking information provided on the Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nform. The GPRS application is a web‐based payment request system that allows grant\nrecipients to submit payment requests via the Internet. GPRS has several features to\nenhance recipients’ ability to manage awards, such as:\n• Secure individual login with audit tracking for each award. • The ability to submit payment requests at any time (including during blackout\nperiods).\n• The ability to view the status of submitted payment requests.\n• The ability to print and export an award’s transaction history. Recipients are required to submit the completed Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nelectronic funds transfer form bearing the original signature of the authorized official of\nthe recipient’s financial institution. The Debt Collection Act of 1996 states that all eligible\nrecipients of Federal payments must receive funds electronically. Recipients are\nreminded to coordinate with their respective financial institutions for an addendum record\nwhich contains payment-related information for their records. In order for a recipient to\nreceive payments requested, the award must have been accepted and a current SF-425\nfor the grant on which payment is requested must be on file in GMS. If Progress\nReports are required for the grant program, the reports must be current or requests for\npayment will be denied. Approved requests will be deposited into the grantee’s financial institution within 3 - 5\nbusiness days of the request."

NOTE: In support of the continuing effort to meet the\naccelerated financial statement reporting requirements mandated by the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury, the OJP’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer will not\nprocess payment requests during the last 4 working days of each month. For this\nreason, OJP strongly suggests that grantees make payment requests before 10 a.m.\neastern standard time, prior to the last 4 working days of each month. 2014 Version Page 33 WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS\nOVW may withhold draw downs from a recipient organization receiving grant funds by\nelectronic transfer, if the recipient demonstrates any of the following:\n1) Failure to attain program or project goals or to establish procedures that will\nminimize the time elapsing between the cash draw downs and expenditure; 2) Failure to adhere to guideline requirements or special conditions; 3) Improper engagement of awarding and administering subawards or contracts; 4) Failure to submit reliable and/or timely reports, including, but not limited to,\nFederal Financial Reports (SF 425) and Progress Reports; and/or\n5) Failure to achieve timely financial reconciliation and closeout at the end of the\nproject period of any grant awarded to the recipient organization. CASH MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1990\nPursuant to the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990, 31 U.S.C. 6503, States\nare no longer exempted from payment of interest to the Federal Government for drawing\ndown funds prior to the need to pay obligations incurred. The provisions of 31 U.S.C.\n6503(c)(1) require that States pay interest in the event that they drawdown funds before\nthe funds are needed to pay for program expenses. In order to minimize the amount of cash on hand, grant recipients should request funds\nbased upon immediate disbursement/reimbursement requirements. Funds will not be\npaid in a lump sum, but rather disbursed over time as project costs are incurred or\nanticipated. Recipients should time their drawdown requests to ensure that Federal\ncash on hand is the minimum needed for disbursements/reimbursements to be made\nimmediately or within 10 days. Fund requests from subrecipients create a continuing cash demand on award balances\nof the State. The State should keep in mind that excess funds held by subrecipients will\nimpair the goals of effective cash management. All recipients must develop procedures\nfor the disbursement of funds to ensure that Federal cash on hand is kept at a minimal\nbalance. The OVW Grants Financial Management Division conducts quarterly financial reviews to\nensure that this requirement is met and that excess cash is not improperly held by\nrecipient organizations. If a recipient determines that it has excess cash on hand, please\ncontact OVW’s GFMD for assistance. INTEREST EARNED Recipients and subrecipients shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer and\ndisbursement of funds. 2014 Version Page 34 1) In accordance with the Indian Self Determination Act, Title U.S.C. 450(j)), tribal\norganizations SHALL NOT be held accountable for interest earned pending their\ndisbursement by such organizations."

This includes,\nbut is not limited to, amounts of orders placed, contracts and grants awarded, services\nreceived and similar transactions that require payment by the recipient during the same\nor a future period. PERIOD OF AVAILABILITY The award period is the period of time when Federal funding is available for obligation by\nthe recipient. The recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from\nobligations incurred during the award period and any pre-award costs authorized by\nOVW. An obligation occurs when funds are encumbered, such as in a valid purchase\norder or requisition to cover the cost of purchasing an authorized item on or after the\nbegin date and up to the last day of the grant period of the award. Any funds not properly\nobligated by the recipient within the grant award period will lapse and revert to OVW for\ndeobligation. The obligation deadline is the last day of the grant award period unless\notherwise stipulated. The obligation period is the same as the award period listed on the\naward document. No additional obligations can be incurred after the end of the grant. Example: If the award period is 10/1/14 to 9/30/17, the obligation deadline is 9/30/17. LIQUIDATION OF FUNDS Grant funds which have been properly obligated by the end of the award period will have\n90 days in which to be liquidated (pay the obligations incurred during the grant period)."

AWARD EXTENSION CRITERIA 2014 Version Page 36 Requests for a no-cost extension of a grant period must be submitted through the Grants\nManagement System (GMS). Grantees are to use the Grant Adjustment Notice (GAN)\nmodule in GMS to request the extension. Extensions may be issued or approved in\nresponse to the GAN request. The request for extension must state the need for the\nextension (including the additional time requested) and justification to support the\nrequest. The extension request must be submitted no later than 30 days prior to the end\nof the award period. Generally, only one extension not to exceed 12 months per award will be permitted. A\nrequest for an extension of the award period of a program beyond 12 months must be\njustified by extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the recipient and\nsubrecipient. Extension requests will be considered only if the extension criteria established below are\nmet by the recipient at the time the request is submitted to OVW. Modifications of the\ngeneral extension policy stated above are at OVW’s discretion. The criteria for\nextending the award period include the following:\n1) Reports - Requests for adjustments will be considered only if the reporting\nrequirements are current. 2) Special Conditions - All special conditions attached to the award must be\nsatisfied, except for those conditions that must be fulfilled in the remaining period\nof the award. This also includes the performance and resolution of audits in a\ntimely manner. 3) Justification - A narrative explaining the need for additional time must be\nsubmitted with an extension request. Complete details must be provided,\nincluding the justification and the circumstances which require the proposed\nextension. Explain the effect of a denial of the request on the project or program. NOTE: Award extensions will not be issued merely for the purpose of using\nunobligated balances. 2014 Version Page 37 Chapter 4: Matching or Cost Sharing\nHIGHLIGHTS OF CHAPTER:\nDefinition of Match\nTypes of Match\nMatch Requirements\nSource and Type of Funds\nTiming of Matching Contributions\nWaiver of Match\nSTOP Program Match Requirements DEFINITION OF MATCH Match is the dollar amount or value that the grantee or other outside party agrees to\ncontribute to a grant program. The costs that the recipient incurs in fulfilling its matching\nor cost sharing requirement are subject to the same requirements as the Federal grant\nfunds. Allowable cash or in-kind match must include those costs which are allowable\naccording to the program guidance and in compliance with applicable cost principles (2\nCFR Parts 220, 225 and 230) and administrative requirements (28 CFR Parts 66 and\n70)."

TYPES OF MATCH\n1) Cash match (also referred to as “hard” match) means the grantee’s non-federal\ncash outlay including the outlay or money contributed to the grantee or\nsubgrantee by other public agencies, institutions, private organizations and\nindividuals spent for project-related costs. 2) In-kind match (also referred to as “soft” match) means the value of non-cash\ncontributions provided by non-Federal third parties. Third party contributions\nmay be in the form of real property, equipment, supplies, and other expendable\nproperty and the value of goods and services directly benefiting and specifically\nidentifiable to the project or program. MATCH REQUIREMENTS A matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both of the\nfollowing:\n1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-type contractor\nunder the assistance agreement. This includes allowable costs borne by nonFederal grants or by other cash donations from non-Federal third parties. 2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the period to which the\ncost sharing or matching requirements applies. 2014 Version Page 38 The following qualifications and exceptions apply:\n1) Costs borne by other Federal grant agreements - Except as provided by Federal\nstatute, a cost sharing or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne\nby another Federal grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a\ngrantee or subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant. 2) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal cost-sharing requirements Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind contributions may count\ntowards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of a grant agreement if\nthey have been or will be counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching\nrequirement of another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement\ncontract, or any other award of Federal funds. 3) Costs financed by program income - Costs paid with program income, as defined\nin 28 CFR 66.25(g)(3) or 70.24 (b)(2), may count towards satisfying a cost\nsharing or matching requirement if permitted by the OVW program. 4) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors - Contractors\nunder a grant may earn income from the activities carried out under the contract\nin addition to the amounts earned from the party awarding the contract. No costs\nof services or property supported by this income may count toward satisfying a\ncost sharing or matching requirement unless other provisions of the grant\nagreement expressly permit this kind of income to be used to meet the\nrequirement. 5) Records - Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting towards satisfying\na cost sharing or matching requirement must be verifiable from the records of\ngrantees and subgrantee or cost-type contractors. These records must show how\nthe value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived.

Costs sharing or\nmatching credit for such contributions shall be given only if the grantee,\nsubgrantee, or contractor has established, along with its regular indirect cost\nrate, a special rate for allocating to individual projects or programs the value\nof the contributions. c) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract may count towards\nsatisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only if it results in:\n2014 Version Page 39 i.

If a third party in-kind contribution is a type not treated in those sections,\nthe value placed upon it shall be fair and reasonable. The following should be considered in determining the valuation of donated goods and\nservices 1) Donated Services –\na) Volunteer services - Unpaid services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by\nindividuals will be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for\nsimilar work in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or\nsubgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates will\nbe consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work in\nthe same labor market. In either case, a reasonable amount for fringe\nbenefits may be included in the valuation. b) Employees of other organizations - When an employer other than a grantee,\nsubgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge the services of\nan employee in the employee's normal line of work, the services will be\nvalued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive of the employee's\nfringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services are in a different line of\nwork, paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies. 2) Donated supplies, loaned equipment or space –\na) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will be valued at the\nmarket value of the supplies at the time of donation. b) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a building but\nretains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair rental rate of the\nequipment or space."

If approval is obtained from OVW, the market value at the time of\ndonation of the donated equipment or buildings and the fair rental\nrate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing or\n2014 Version Page 40 matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant\nagreement may require that the approval be obtained from the\nFederal agency as well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval\nmay be given only if a purchase of the equipment or rental of the\nland would be approved as an allowable direct cost. If any part of\nthe donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the\nnon-federal share of the property may be counted as cost-sharing\nor matching. ii. If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section,\nno amount may be counted for donated land, and only\ndepreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated\nequipment and buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for\nthis property are not treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated as costs incurred by the grantee or\nsubgrantee. They are computed and allocated (usually as indirect\ncosts) in accordance with the cost principles specified in Sec.\n66.22, in the same way as depreciation or use allowances for\npurchased equipment and buildings. The amount of depreciation\nor use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is based\non the property's market value at the time it was donated. Appraisal of real property - In some cases it will be necessary to establish the market\nvalue of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of space in a building. In these\ncases, the Federal agency may require the market value or fair rental value be set by an\nindependent appraiser, and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee.

NOTE: The most common error found during the final financial reconciliation of a grant\nat closeout is the failure to properly report matching funds. The full matching share\nprovided (both cash and in-kind) must be reported on the final Federal Financial Report\n(SF 425) submitted at the end of the grant period. If the matching share is not reported,\nOVW will assume that the grantee did not meet the required match and if necessary will\ninitiate collection of a cash match from the grantee. WAIVER OF MATCH In accordance with 48 U.S.C. §1469a, OVW, in its discretion, may and does waive any\nrequirement for matching funds under $200,000 otherwise required by law to be\nprovided by the certain insular areas. This waiver applies to ALL awards made to\nAmerican Samoa, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands. STOP PROGRAM MATCH REQUIREMENTS There is a 25% match requirement imposed on grant funds under the STOP Formula\nprogram. A grant made under this program may not cover more than 75 percent of the\ntotal costs of the project being funded. However for awards issued by OVW in FY 2014\nor later, the state is exempted from matching the portion of the state award that goes to\na victim service provider for victim services or that goes to tribes. Grantees must identify\nthe source of the 25 percent non-Federal portion of the project costs and how match\nfunds are used. Grantees may satisfy the required match with either cash or in-kind\nservices. 2014 Version Page 42"

Specifically, 42 U.S.C. § 13925 (b)(1) provides: No matching funds shall be required for any grant or subgrant made under this Act for—\n• any tribe, Territory, or victim service provider; or • any other entity, including a State, that—\no o Petitions for a waiver of any match condition imposed by the Attorney\nGeneral or the Secretaries of Health and Human Services or Housing and\nUrban Development; and\nWhose petition for a waiver is determined by the Attorney General or the\nSecretaries of Health and Human Services or Housing and Urban\nDevelopment to have adequately demonstrated the financial need of the\npetitioning entity.

The following provisions apply to match requirements:\n• A State may use its discretion to require some or all of its subgrantees (except\nvictim services organizations and Indian Tribal governments) to meet the match\nrequirement, in whole or in part. OVW encourages States to consider the ability\nof subgrantees to meet match requirements when deciding whether and how\nmuch of the match to pass on; however, the State remains responsible to satisfy\nthe match requirement. • Funds or in-kind resources used as match must be directly related to the project\ngoals and objectives.

Program income may only be used for allowable program costs. Grantees may earn income to defray program costs. Program income includes income\nfrom fees for services performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property\nacquired with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a grant\nagreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans approved to be made\nwith grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in the Department regulations or the\nterms and conditions of the award, program income does not include interest on grant\nfunds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc., or interest earned on any of them. ACCOUNTING FOR PROGRAM INCOME Grantees and subgrantees must maintain records which adequately identify the source\nand application of program income. Program income must be approved by OVW in the\nbudget and reported on the Federal Financial Report (SF 425). Costs incident to the\ngeneration of program income may be deducted from the gross income to determine\nprogram income provided that these costs have not been charged to the grant. Unless provided otherwise in the award terms and conditions or Departmental\nregulation, recipients will have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding\nprogram income earned after the end of the project period. The Federal portion of program income must be accounted for up to the same ratio of\nFederal participation as funded in the project or program. For example:\n1) A project funded with 100 percent Federal funds must account for and report on\n100 percent of the total program income earned. If the total program income\nearned was $20,000, the recipient must account for and report the $20,000 as\nprogram income on the Federal Financial Report. 2) A project funded with 75 percent Federal funds and 25 percent non-Federal\nfunds and the total program income earned by the grant was $100,000, $75,000\n2014 Version Page 45 must be accounted for and reported, by the recipient, as program income on the\nFederal Financial Report. USE OF PROGRAM INCOME\nProgram income must be used for the purposes of and under the conditions applicable\nto the award. If the cost is allowable under the Federal grant program, then the cost\nwould be allowable using program income. Program income earned must be used to pay\nfor program activities before an organization may request additional funds or\ndrawdowns. Unless specifically directed by OVW, program income may be used in accordance with\none of the following methods:\n(1) Deduction method - Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from total\nallowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income shall be used for\ncurrent costs unless the Federal agency authorizes otherwise. Program income which\nthe grantee did not anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the\nFederal agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to\nthe project. (2) Addition - When authorized, program income may be added to the funds committed\nto the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the grantee."

(3) Cost sharing or matching - When authorized, program income may be used to meet\nthe cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant agreement. The amount of the\nFederal grant award remains the same. EXAMPLES OF PROGRAM INCOME The following are examples of program income:\n Sale of property and equipment – Proceeds from the sale of property or\nequipment acquired under the program. Such transactions must be in\naccordance with 28 CFR 66.31 and 66.32 or 28 CFR 70.32 and 70.34.  Royalties – If specifically identified in the grant agreement, income from\nroyalties and license fees for copyrights, patents, inventions or other works\ndeveloped under the program may be treated as program income.  Registration/Tuition Fees – Fees charged for attendance at trainings and\nconferences supported by Federal funds may be treated as program income. These types of program income shall be treated in accordance with\ndisposition instructions set forth in the project’s terms and conditions.  Membership Fees - When an organization receives membership fees and its\nonly source of income is Federal grant funds, the membership fees will\ngenerally be considered program income. Where non-member income is 2014 Version Page 46 received and used to provide services to members in addition to the federally\nfunded services, membership income may be considered program income in\nproportion to the amount of Federal and non-Federal funds received. However, to the extent that membership fees were received by the\norganization prior to the receipt of Federal grant funds, or are used to provide\nservices to members that are separate and distinct from grant-funded\nservices, the membership fees need not be reported as program income. 2014 Version Page 47 Chapter 6: Adjustments to Awards\nHIGHLIGHTS OF CHAPTER:\nBudget Changes\nProgrammatic Changes\nGrant Adjustment Notices\nNotification Grant recipients are permitted to make limited changes to their projects; however,\ncertain changes may require prior approval from OVW.

Any loss, damage, or theft of\nthe property must be investigated, and fully documented, and made part of the official\nproject records. PROPERTY STANDARDS Property standards found in 28 CFR Parts 66 and 70 govern the management and\ndisposition of property obtained for projects supported by a Federal award. OVW\nrequires recipients to observe these standards and will not impose additional\nrequirements unless required by a Federal statute. Recipients and subrecipients may\nuse their own property management standards and procedures provided their standards\nare at least as stringent as the Federal requirements. INSURANCE COVERAGE Recipients and subrecipients must, at a minimum, provide insurance coverage for\nequipment obtained with Federal funds equivalent to that coverage of property owned by\nthe recipient. Insurance for Federally-owned property is not required unless stated in the\nterms and conditions of the award. 2014 Version Page 51 REAL PROPERTY Real property means land, including land improvements, buildings, structures and\nappurtenances thereto, but excludes movable machinery and equipment. Generally\nOVW programs do not permit the purchase of real property with grant funds. EQUIPMENT Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a useful life of\nmore than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. A grantee should\nuse its own definition of equipment provided that such definition would at least include all\nequipment defined above. Title – Title to equipment acquired by a recipient or subrecipient with Federal funds vests\nwith the recipient subject to the limitations outlined in 28 CFR Parts 66 and 70. Use - States will use, manage, and dispose of equipment acquired under a grant by the\nState in accordance with State laws and procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees\nare required to comply with the following guidelines:\n1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in the program or project\nfor which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or\nprogram continues to be supported by Federal funds. When no longer needed for\nthe original program or project, the equipment may be used in other activities\ncurrently or previously supported by a Federal agency. 2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available for use on other\nprojects or programs currently or previously supported by the Federal\nGovernment, providing such use will not interfere with the work on the project or\nprogram for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use shall\nbe given to other programs or projects supported by OVW. User fees should be\nconsidered if appropriate and treated as program income."

Management requirements - Procedures for managing equipment (including\nreplacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part with grant funds, until\ndisposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet the following requirements: 1) Property records must be maintained that include a description of the property, a\nserial number or other identification number, the source of property, who holds\ntitle, the acquisition date, acquisition cost of the property, percentage of Federal\nparticipation in the cost of the property, the location, unit acquisition cost, use\nand condition of the property, and any ultimate disposition data including the date\nof disposal and sale price of the property. 2014 Version Page 52 2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the results reconciled with\nthe property records at least once every two years. 3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent\nloss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft shall be\ninvestigated. 4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the property in\ngood condition. 5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell the property, proper\nsales procedures must be established to ensure the highest possible return. Disposition - When original or replacement equipment acquired under a grant or\nsubgrant is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities\ncurrently or previously supported by a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will\nbe made as follows: 1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5,000\nmay be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to OVW. 2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in excess of $5,000\nmay be retained or sold and OVW shall have a right to an amount calculated by\nmultiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by OVW's share of the\nequipment. 3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate disposition\nactions, OVW may direct the grantee or subgrantee to take excess and\ndisposition actions.

To be allowable under Federal\nawards, costs must meet the following general criteria:\n1) Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient performance and\nadministration of Federal awards and the specific grant program under which an\naward has been made. 2) Be allocable to Federal awards under the applicable provisions of 2 CFR Parts\n220, 225 or 230. 3) Be authorized or not prohibited under State or local laws or regulations. 4) Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in the applicable OMB cost\nprinciples, Federal laws, terms and conditions of the Federal award, or other\ngoverning regulations as to types or amounts of cost items. 5) Be consistent with policies, regulations, and procedures that apply uniformly to\nboth Federal awards and other activities of the recipient organization. 6) Be accorded consistent treatment. A cost may not be assigned to a Federal\naward as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like\ncircumstances has been allocated to the Federal award as an indirect cost. 7) Except as otherwise provided, be determined in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. 8) Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching\nrequirements of any other Federal award in either the current or a prior period,\nexcept as specifically provided by Federal law or regulation. 9) Be the net of all applicable credits. 10) Be adequately documented. REASONABLE COSTS A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be\nincurred by a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision\nwas made to incur the cost. The question of reasonableness is particularly important\nwhen organizations are predominately federally-funded. In determining reasonableness\nof a given cost, consideration shall be given to:\n1) Whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the\noperation of the organization or the performance of the Federal award. 2014 Version Page 55 2) The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as: Sound business\npractices; arm's-length bargaining; Federal, State and other laws and regulations;\nand, terms and conditions of the Federal award. 3) Market prices for comparable goods or services. 4) Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the circumstances\nconsidering their responsibilities to the organization, its employees, the public at\nlarge, and the Federal Government. 5) Significant deviations from the established practices of the organization which may\nunjustifiably increase the Federal award's cost. ALLOCABLE COSTS A cost is allocable, or capable of being distributed, to a particular cost objective (ex.\ngrant, cooperative agreement, contract, project, etc.) if the goods or services involved\nare chargeable or assignable to such cost objective in accordance with relative benefits\nreceived."

A cost can be allocated to a Federal award if it is treated consistently with\nother costs incurred for the same purposes and in like circumstances and if it is incurred\nspecifically for the award or benefits both the award and other activities of the\norganization and can be distributed in proportion to the benefits received. Where an accumulation of indirect costs will ultimately result in charges to a Federal\naward, a cost allocation plan will be required. All activities which benefit from the\norganization’s indirect cost, including unallowable activities and services donated by\nthird parties, will receive an appropriate allocation of indirect costs. Additionally, any\ncost allocable to a particular Federal award or cost objective may not be charged to\nother Federal awards to overcome fund deficiencies, to avoid restrictions imposed by\nlaw or terms of the Federal awards, or for other reasons. COMPOSITION OF COST The total cost of Federal awards is comprised of the allowable direct cost of the\nprogram, plus its allocable portion of allowable indirect costs, less applicable credits. There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect under\nevery accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific service or\nfunction, but indirect with respect to the Federal award or other final cost objective. Therefore, it is essential that each item of cost be treated consistently in like\ncircumstances either as a direct or an indirect cost. Guidelines for determining direct and\nindirect costs charged to Federal awards are provided in the applicable cost principles. Direct costs are those that can be identified specifically with a particular final cost\nobjective. Typical direct costs chargeable to Federal awards are:\n\n\n\n Compensation of employees for the time devoted and identified specifically to the\nperformance of those awards. Cost of materials acquired, consumed, or expended specifically for the purpose\nof those awards. Equipment and other approved capital expenditures. Travel expenses incurred specifically to carry out the award. 2014 Version Page 56 Any direct cost of a minor amount may be treated as an indirect cost for reasons of\npracticality where such accounting treatment for that item of cost is consistently applied\nto all cost objectives. HIGHLIGHTED ITEMS OF COSTS The cost principles establish principles and standards for determining costs of grants,\ncontracts and other agreements. Failure to mention a particular item of cost is not\nintended to imply that it is unallowable. Rather, determination as to the allowability in\neach case should be based on the treatment or principles provided for similar or related\nitems of cost. Personnel\nCompensation for personnel services are allowable to the extent that they are\nreasonable, conform to the organization’s established policies, and are supported by\nsufficient documentation."

Personnel\nCompensation for personnel services are allowable to the extent that they are\nreasonable, conform to the organization’s established policies, and are supported by\nsufficient documentation. Charges made to Federal awards for personal services\n(including, but not limited to salaries, wages, and fringe benefits), whether treated as\ndirect or indirect costs, will be based on payrolls documented in accordance with the\ngenerally accepted practice of the organization and be approved by a responsible\nofficial(s) of the organization. Charges to OVW grants for compensation of employees of recipient organizations are\nlimited to 110 percent of the maximum salary payable to a member of the Federal\nGovernment’s Senior Executive Service at an agency with a certified SES Performance\nAppraisal System for that year. This information can be found on the Office of Personnel\nManagement website (www.opm.gov). When recipient employees work solely on a specific grant award, no other\ndocumentation is required. However, after-the-fact certifications that the employee is\nworking 100 percent of their time on the grant award must be prepared no less\nfrequently than every 6 months, and must be signed by the employee and supervisory\nofficial having firsthand knowledge of the work performed. Where salaries are for performance on two or more grant programs, cost activities,\nproject periods, and/or overlapping periods, proration of costs to each activity must be\nmade based on time and/or effort reports. These reports should: reflect an after-the-fact\ndistribution of the actual activity of each employee; account for the total activity of each\nemployee; be prepared at least monthly; coincide with one or more pay periods; and be\nsigned by the employee. These reports should also be reviewed and approved on a\nregular basis by a supervisory official having first-hand knowledge of the work\nperformed. The approving official should document the review and approval by signing\nor initialing each employee’s time and/or effort report. In cases where two or more grants\nconstitute one identified activity or program, salary charges to one grant may be\nallowable after written permission is obtained from OVW. Overtime payments are allowable only to the extent that payment for such services is in\naccordance with the policies of the organization and have the approval of OVW. The\n2014 Version Page 57 overtime premium should be prorated among the jobs and not be charged exclusively to\nthe Federal award. Charges for time of employees assigned to assistance programs may be reimbursed to\nthe extent they are directly and exclusively related to the award or proper for inclusion in\nthe indirect cost base. In no case is dual compensation allowable. Fringe Benefits\nFringe Benefits, both in the form of regular compensation paid to employees (ex.\nVacation or sick leave) and in the form of employer contributions or expenses (ex. Social\nSecurity, employee insurance, or worker’s compensation), are allowable costs provided\nsuch benefits are in accordance with established written organizational policies.

These costs are\nconsidered reasonable and allowable to the extent that the travel costs do not exceed\ncharges normally allowed by the organization in its regular operations as the result of the\norganization’s written travel policy. OVW reserves the right to determine the\nreasonableness of an organization’s policies. If a recipient does not have a written travel\npolicy, the recipient must abide by the Federal travel regulations. The current Federal\ntravel policy and per diem rate information is available at the GSA Web site\nhttp://www.gsa.gov. Consultants/Contracts\nCosts of professional and consultant services rendered by persons who are members of\na particular profession or possess a special skill, and are not officers or employees of\nthe organization, are allowable subject to the limitations outlined in 2 CFR Parts 220,\n225 and 230. Additionally, consultant rates in excess of $650/day or $81.25/hour require\nprior approval by OVW. Compensation for services by an individual consultant should be\nreasonable and consistent with that paid for similar services in the marketplace. Applicants should consider the type of services provided and the experience and\nexpertise of the individual consultant when deciding if a consultant’s rate is reasonable. Grantees are strongly discouraged from requesting consultant rates in excess of $650\nper day. Please note that this does not mean that the rate can or should be as high as\n$650 for all consultants. If a project is ultimately selected for funding with a budget\nallocating more than $650 per day to a consultant, then the grantee must provide\nadditional information to OVW for review and approval before consultant costs may be\nincurred. Meetings and conferences The costs of meetings and conferences, the primary purpose of which is the\ndissemination of technical information, are allowable. This includes cost of\ntransportation, rental of facilities, speakers’ fees, and other items incidental to such 2014 Version Page 58 meetings and conferences. For guidance on conference costs, including cost\nlimitations and thresholds, refer to Chapter 9: Conference Cost Guidelines. 1) Refreshments - Refreshments include light food and drink served during break time,\nsuch as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies,\nchips, or muffins. Refreshments are generally not allowed. Refreshments will only\nbe considered under unique and extenuating circumstances of the conference and\nrequire significant justification to be considered. The cost of these items, plus any\nhotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality meals and incidental\nexpenses (M&IE) rate per attendee per day. For example, if the M&IE rate for a\nparticular location is $54 per person per day, then the total refreshments costs\ncannot exceed $12.42 ($54 x 23%) per attendee per day. 2) Meals - OVW funding should not be used to purchase food and/or beverages for any\nmeeting, conference, training, or other event. Upon request by an awardee, a rare\nexception may be made by OVW for working meals at a conference that are\nnecessary to accomplish official business and enhance the cost effectiveness of the\nconference."

These guidelines have\nbeen established to assist OVW grant and cooperative agreement award recipients in\nthe planning of meetings and conferences. These guidelines are intended to help\nminimize the cost of conferences that are funded with OVW funds. Included in these\nguidelines is information that will assist recipients in planning a conference and establish\nlimits on the allowable costs at conferences. Also, we have provided information on the\nDOJ approval process for DOJ sponsored meetings and conferences as well as on the\nconference cost reporting that takes place after a conference has been held. The policy applies to all OVW award recipients, including recipients of grants,\ncooperative agreements, and contracts. All award recipients are subject to monitoring\nand should maintain all necessary documentation to support any conference costs or\nfood and beverage expenses. Recipients are encouraged to identify alternative training\nmethods (e.g. webinars, teleconferences, etc.), acquire lower cost locations and venues,\nand avoid the appearance of extravagant spending. However, only recipients of\ncooperative agreements and contracts need to obtain prior approval and report on their\nconferences, meetings, and events. While grant recipients are not specifically required\nto obtain prior approval and report on their conferences, meetings and events, they are\nstill responsible for following the guidelines contained herein. LOCATION Minimizing costs must be the primary goal of a grantee or cooperative agreement\nrecipient (or subcontractor) when determining the city and facility in which to hold a\nconference. Conference planners must compare multiple facilities in multiple locations\nunless there is an overriding operational reason to hold a conference in a specific\nlocation. Recipients must make every effort to use no-cost facilities (including available\ngovernment facilities) to the extent practicable."

Recipients must make every effort to use no-cost facilities (including available\ngovernment facilities) to the extent practicable. Special care should be taken when\nconsidering holding a conference in a location or facility that may raise appearance\nissues (such as a resort location), and these should only be used when they are the\nmost cost-effective option (such as when the majority of attendees live in that location). To ensure that the most cost effective location is selected, recipients should obtain\nseveral estimates before making a decision. A minimum of three estimates is required. 2014 Version Page 62 CONFERENCE PLANNING COSTS Conference planning requires fiscal prudence and all recipients must review conference\nplanning costs and eliminate all costs that are not absolutely critical or that exceed\nreasonable and necessary levels. Cooperative agreement recipients are required to track any time and activity spent on\nplanning conferences separate from time and activity spent on substantive matters. Cooperative agreement recipients must include this information in the required\nconference reporting. Conference planning has been divided into two categories,\nlogistical and programmatic. Logistical planning includes activities such as recommending venues, advertising,\nsetting up audio-visual equipment, securing hotel rooms, and other non-programmatic\nfunctions. The cost allowed for logistical conference planning (regardless of whether the\nrecipient is planning in-house or is contracting with an outside conference planner) is\nlimited to $50 for each attendee, not to exceed a cumulative total of $8,750. For\nexample, if the number of attendees at a conference is 100, the cost allowed for a\nlogistical planner is $5,000 ($50 X 100 attendees). Recipients must include the cost of\ntrainers, instructors, presenters and facilitators as well as all other attendees when\nestimating the cost for logistical planning. Indirect cost rates must be applied to\nconference planning costs in accordance with negotiated agreements as well as the\nDOJ policy, and must be included when estimating the cost of logistical planning. If the\nrecipient expects that the conference planning costs will not exceed these limitations, no\nfurther justification is required. If the recipient expects to exceed these limitations, the\nrecipient must justify the costs in writing and the Office on Violence Against Women\nmust approve those costs before the recipient can proceed with the logistical planning. Programmatic planning includes developing conference agendas, content, and written\nmaterials. The cost allowed for programmatic conference planning (regardless of\nwhether the recipient is planning in-house or is contracting with an outside programmatic\nconference planner) is limited to $200 for each attendee, not to exceed a cumulative\ncost total of $35,000. For example, if the number of attendees at the conference is 100,\nthe cost allowed for a programmatic planner is $20,000 ($200 X 100 attendees). Recipients must include the cost of trainers, instructors, presenters and facilitators as\nwell as all other attendees when estimating the cost for programmatic planning. Indirect\ncost rates must be applied to conference planning costs in accordance with negotiated\nagreements as well as the DOJ policy, and must be included when calculating the\nplanning thresholds."

If the recipient expects to\nexceed these limitations, the recipient must justify the costs in writing and the Office on\nViolence Against Women must approve those costs before the recipient can proceed\nwith the logistical planning. 2014 Version Page 63 MEETING SPACE AND AUDIO VISUAL EQUIPMENT The cost of meeting space and audio visual (AV) equipment rental must be limited to\n$25 per day per attendee, not to exceed a total of $20,000 for the conference. For\nexample, if there are 50 people meeting for a 2-day conference, the cost for meeting\nspace and AV combined cannot exceed $2,500 (50 attendees x $25 x 2 days). Indirect\ncost rates must be applied to conference space and audio-visual equipment costs in\naccordance with negotiated agreements, and must be included when calculating this\ncost estimate. Additional justification is necessary if the threshold is exceeded. This\nmay lead to a considerable increase in the time it takes to receive approval. FOOD AND BEVERAGE COSTS\nOVW funding should not be used to purchase food and/or beverages for any meeting,\nconference, training, or other event. A rare exception may be made for working meals at\na conference that are necessary to accomplishing official business and enhancing the\ncost effectiveness of the conference. Consideration will be given if one of the following\napplies:\n \n\n The location of the event is not in close proximity to food establishments. Note\nthat it should be a priority to try to secure a location near reasonably priced and\naccessible commercial food establishments. (Additional justification must be\nprovided for using the selected location.); If not serving food will significantly lengthen the day or necessitate extending the\nmeeting to achieve meeting outcomes; If a special presentation at a conference requires a plenary address where there\nis no other time for food to be attained; or\nOther extenuating circumstances which necessitate the provision of food. While meals may at times be permissible, OVW funds should not be used to provide\nfood and/or beverages at any other time of day (i.e. as part of a refreshment break)\nwithout specific prior approval. Refreshment breaks will only be considered where there\nare unique and extenuating circumstances and require significant justification. Furthermore, if a meal is approved by OVW, the cost of any individual meal, plus taxes\nand any hotel service costs (e.g., labor cost for room setup), must not exceed 150\npercent of the General Services Administration (GSA) Meals and Incidental Expenses\n(M&IE) rate for that meal in that locality per attendee.

The current GSA M&IE rate breakdown by meal and by locality can be found at\nhttp://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/101518. Note that the above restrictions do not\nprevent the direct payment of per diem amounts to individuals in a travel status under\ntheir organization’s travel policy; however, all conference attendees must ensure that the\n2014 Version Page 64 provided meal is deducted from their claimed M&IE; in this example, the recipient would\ndeduct $11 from the amount of M&IE claimed for the lunch provided. OTHER CONFERENCE COST ITEMS Trinkets (items such as hats, mugs, portfolios, t-shirts, coins, etc., regardless of whether\nthey include the conference name or logo) cannot be purchased with OVW grant funds. Basic supplies that are necessary for use during the conference (e.g., pens, paper,\nname tags) may be purchased. OVW grant funds cannot be used for costs of entertainment, including amusement,\ndiversion, social activities and any costs directly associated with such costs (such as\ntickets to shows or sports events, meals, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities). INDIRECT COSTS Indirect costs are applicable to conference costs if your organization has a federally\napproved Indirect Cost Rate. Cooperative agreement recipients must identify indirect\ncosts on the Conference Approval Request Form and Conference Reporting Form. Organizations must apply their Indirect Cost Rates to conference costs in accordance\nwith the agreement as well as the DOJ policy and these costs must be included as part\nof the total cost of a conference. Organizations that use the Modified Total Direct Cost distribution method must comply\nwith the following restrictions:\n  Subcontract/Subaward for Educational Institutions and Non-Profit\nOrganization: Indirect costs can only be applied to the first $25,000 of any\nsubcontract or subaward under the agreement. This limitation must be\napplied to all conference-related subcontracts, including those with hotels and\ntravel agents. Participant Support Costs for Non-Profit Organizations: Participant support\ncosts are direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances,\ntravel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or\ntrainees (but not employees). Recipients may not, therefore, apply indirect\ncost rates to participant support costs such as lodging, meals and incidental\nexpenses, local transportation, and airfare (common carrier transportation). This applies to the entirety of any subcontracts for the lodging and travel of\nthe participants of a conference. APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS Cooperative agreement recipients must complete and submit the “DOJ-Sponsored\nConference Request and\nReport Form” to their OVW program specialist and\nOVW. ConferenceReport@usdoj.gov for review and approval prior to entering into a\ncontract for any meeting, conference, training, or other event (with the exception of\nlogistical or programmatic planning contracts that meet the established cost threshold).

Where the intention to enter into an\nagreement for principle activities is known at the time of application, the approval may be\nconsidered given, if these activities are funded as proposed. All such arrangements must be formalized in a contract/memorandum of understanding\n(MOU) or other written agreement between the parties involved. The contract, MOU or\nagreement must, at a minimum, include:\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n5)\n6)\n7) Activities to be performed; Time schedule;\nProject policies; Flow-through requirements that are applicable to the subrecipient; Other policies and procedures to be followed;\nDollar limitation of the agreement;\nSignatures of authorized representatives from all parties entering into the agreement;\nand\n8) Cost principles to be used in determining allowable costs. Many OVW programs require applicants/grantee organizations to collaborate with MOU\npartners on their projects. In cases where the agreement reflects a true MOU\nrelationship and not a contract for the procurement of goods or services, then solesource justification and approval does not apply. The contract, MOU or other written agreement does not affect the primary recipient’s\noverall responsibility for the project and accountability to OVW. The primary recipient is\nresponsible for monitoring the subrecipient and ascertaining that all fiscal and\nprogrammatic responsibilities are fulfilled.

CODES OF CONDUCT Recipients must maintain written standards for code of conduct covering the\nperformance of employees engaged in the review, award and administration of contracts\n(please also see Chapter 3 of this Guide regarding Conflicts). No employee, officer or\nagent shall participate in the selection, award or administration of a contract supported\nby Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. A conflict\nwould arise when the employee, officer or agent any member of his or her immediate\nfamily, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any\nof the parties indicated above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an\naward. The employees, officers and agents shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities,\nfavors or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors or parties to\nsubagreements. However, recipients may set minimum rules where the financial interest\nis not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. COMPETITION All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner so as to provide, to the\nmaximum extent practical, open and free competition. Recipients must be alert to actual\nor potential organizational conflicts of interest or noncompetitive practices among\n2014 Version Page 68 contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order\nto ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage,\ncontractors involved in developing or drafting specifications, requirements, statements of\nwork, and/or requests for proposals for a proposed procurement shall be excluded from\ncompeting for such procurements. Awards should be made to the bidder or offerer\nwhose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the\nrecipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations should clearly outline\nall requirements that the bidder must fulfill in order for the bid to be evaluated by the\nrecipient. Any and all bids may be rejected when it is in the recipient’s interest to do so,\nsubject to this guidance.

Procurement by noncompetitive proposals (sole source procurement) is procurement\nthrough solicitation of a proposal from only one source or after solicitation of a number of\nsources that competition is determined to be inadequate.

These written procedures\nmust, at a minimum, cover the following:\n1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items; 2) When appropriate, a lease versus purchase analysis should be completed to\ndetermine the most economical and practical procurement for the Federal\ngovernment; and\n3) Solicitations should provide for the following: include a clear and accurate description\nof the technical and functional requirements for the material, product or service,\nrequirements for the bidder to fulfill, “brand name or equal” descriptions that bidders\nmust meet, acceptance of metric system where feasible, and preference for products\nor services that conserve natural resources and protect the environment. Recipients should make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms\nand women’s business enterprises. Information on opportunities should be made\navailable and include time frames for purchases and contracts that encourage\nparticipation by these types of organizations. The type of procurement instrument used (ex. fixed price contract, cost reimbursement\ncontracts, purchase orders, etc.) may be determined by the recipient and must be\nappropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the\nprogram or project.

Recipients must not make awards to any party which is debarred,\nsuspended, or is otherwise excluded from receiving an award or ineligible from receiving\nan award under Executive Orders 12549 and 12689 (2 CFR Part 180). COST AND PRICE ANALYSIS Recipients must perform some form of cost or price analysis for every procurement\naction and it must be documented in the procurement files. The method and degree of\nanalysis is dependent on facts surrounding the particular procurement. As a starting\npoint, recipients should make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price\nquotes submitted, market prices and similar information, together with discounts. Cost\nanalysis is the review and evaluation of each element of cost to determine\nreasonableness, allocability and allowability.

FEDERAL FINANCIAL REPORTS (FFR or SF-425)\nOVW requires direct grant recipients to report on a quarterly basis using the Federal\nFinancial Report or SF 425. This form replaces the Financial Status Report or SF 269a. A copy of the FFR is available in Appendix II of this guide. Quarterly Federal Financial\nReports (FFR) should be submitted online through the Grants Management System\n(GMS). OVW grantees are required to designate and approve at least one Financial\nPoint of Contact (FPOC) in GMS before they can file the FFR. An FPOC must be\nregistered and approved by the Grant Point of Contact through GMS at\nhttps://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov. The FFR contains the cumulative expenditures and unliquidated obligations incurred for\nthe grant as well as program income and indirect costs. The award recipients will report\nprogram outlays and revenue on a cash or accrual basis in accordance with their\naccounting system. Federal Financial Reports are due no later than 30 days after the end of the calendar\nquarter for the entire period of the award. The final report must be submitted no later\nthan 90 days following the end of the grant period. Grantees are encouraged to submit\nthe FFR as soon as the quarter ends to avoid delays in processing and access to grant\nfunds. 2014 Version Page 72 The due dates for submission of Federal Financial Report are:\nReporting Period: Due by: January 1 - March 31\nApril 1 - June 30\nJuly 1 - September 30\nOctober 1 - December 31 April 30\nJuly 30\nOctober 30\nJanuary 30 Failure by a recipient to submit the SF‐425 on time will result in an automatic freeze on\nfunds, may affect future awards, will cause a Grant Adjustment Notices (GANs) to\nwithhold funds, and may lead to the suspension and/or termination of the award. If an\nSF-425 is delinquent, GMS will automatically send an email notifying the recipient that\nfunds have been frozen. Once the recipient submits the overdue financial report, GMS\nwill automatically generate a GAN to release funds. Please note that the release of funds\ncan take several days to process through the grant and financial systems.

PROGRESS REPORTS Under the Government Performance and Results Act (GRPA) and VAWA 2000,\ngrantees are required to collect and maintain data that measure the effectiveness of\ntheir grant-funded activities. Each grant program’s progress reporting form reflects the different statutorily authorized\nactivities that grantees perform, and collects uniform information on victims served,\ndemographics, and common activities that occur across grant programs. These progress\nreport forms provide OVW with comprehensive data regarding grantee activities and are\nused for Congressional reporting, OVW’s outreach strategy, and other performancerelated data reporting. OVW grantees are required to submit semi-annual or annual progress reports through\nthe GMS. All OVW awards contain a special condition on the award requiring recipients\nto comply with the submission of these progress reports. Semi-annual progress reports must be submitted within 30 days after the end of the\nreporting periods, which are June 30, and December 31, for the life of the award. Generally annual progress reports for Formula grant programs are due by March 30 for\nthe prior year.

Source documents include copies of all awards, applications, and required recipient\nfinancial and narrative reports. Personnel and payroll records shall include the time and\nattendance reports for all individuals reimbursed under the award, whether they are\nemployed fulltime or part-time. Time and effort reports are also required for consultants,\nas well as justification of consultant rates in accordance with market value. RETENTION PERIOD All records pertinent to an award must be maintained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report. In cases where litigation, a claim, or\nan audit is initiated prior to expiration of the three year period, records must be retained\nuntil completion of the action and final resolution of issues or the end of the three year\nperiod, whichever is later. Records for real property and equipment acquired with\nFederal funds must be maintained for three years after the final disposition. In order to\navoid duplicate recordkeeping, OVW may make arrangements with recipients to retain\nany records which are needed for joint use. When the records are transferred to OVW,\nthe three year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient. Indirect cost proposals, cost allocation plans, and their supporting documentation\n(including indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any\nsimilar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is\nchargeable) shall also be retained for three years. For proposals submitted for\nnegotiation, the retention period begins on the date of submission. For indirect cost\nproposals that are not required to be submitted to OVW, the retention period begins at\nthe end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan or\nother computation. 2014 Version Page 75 In some cases grantees must report on program income earned after the period of grant\nsupport. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records\npertaining to the earning of income starts from the end of the grantee’s fiscal year in\nwhich the income is earned. Retention is required for purposes of Federal examination and audit. Records may be\nretained in an automated format.

Where prior approval is required for subrecipients, authority will be vested in the\nrecipient unless specified as being “retained by OVW”. PROCEDURES FOR REQUESTING PRIOR APPROVAL Requests for prior approval submitted to OVW must include an explanation to justify the\nallowability. The request may be submitted:\n1) Through inclusion in the budget or other components of an award or application; or\n2) Through GMS as a Program Office Approval Grant Adjustment Notice or Budget\nModification Grant Adjustment Notice. The costs should be specifically identified as\npart of a prior approval request when combined with a budget modification. COSTS REQUIRING PRIOR APPROVAL The following costs are examples of costs that require prior approval. This list is not\nintended to be all inclusive. Please refer to the applicable cost principle to determine if a\ncost requires prior approval. 1) Pre-agreement Costs – Pre-agreement or pre-award costs are those incurred prior to\nthe effective date of the award directly pursuant to the negotiation and in anticipation\nof the award where such costs are necessary to comply with the proposed delivery\nschedule or period of performance. Such costs are allowable only to the extent that\nthey would have been allowable if incurred after the date of the award and only with\nthe written approval from OVW. 2) Proposal Costs - Unless specifically outlined in program guidance as allowable\nwithout prior approval, direct costs to projects for preparing proposals for potential\nFederal awards require prior approval. Generally OVW does not approve these\ncosts. 3) Conference Costs – Cooperative agreement recipients are required to obtain prior\napproval before entering into a contract or expending funds for any meeting,\nconference, training, or other event (with the exception of logistical or programmatic\nplanning contracts that meet the established cost thresholds). Please refer to\nChapter 9: Conference Costs for additional information on this requirement. 2014 Version Page 79 4) Consultant Rates - Consultant rates that exceed $650 for an 8-hour day, or $81.25\nper hour (excluding travel and subsistence costs) require prior approval from OVW. Prior approval requests require additional justification. Compensation for individual\nconsultant services is to be reasonable and consistent with that paid for similar\nservices in the marketplace and consistent with the individual’s experience and\nexpertise. Consideration will be given to compensation including fringe benefits for\nthose individuals whose employers do not provide such benefits. An 8-hour day may\ninclude preparation, evaluation, and travel time in addition to the time required for\nactual performance. Please note, however, that this does not mean that the rate can\nor should be $650 for all consultants. Rates should be developed and reviewed on a\ncase-by-case basis and must be reasonable and allowable in accordance with OMB\ncost principles. Approval of consultant rates, in excess of $650 a day, that are part of\nthe original application with appropriate justification and supporting data will be\napproved on a case-by-case basis."

Foreign travel is defined as any travel outside of\nCanada, Mexico, the United States and its territories and possessions. However, for\norganizations located in foreign countries, the term “foreign travel” means travel\noutside that country. Each separate foreign trip requires prior approval.

The cost of operating and maintaining facilities, depreciation, and\nadministrative salaries are examples of the types of costs that are usually treated as\nindirect. APPROVED PLAN AVAILABLE 1) OVW may accept any current indirect cost rate or allocation plan previously\napproved for a recipient by any Federal awarding agency on the basis of allocation\nmethods substantially in accord with those set forth in the applicable cost circulars. 2) Where the approved final indirect cost rate is lower than the actual indirect cost rate\nincurred, recipients may not charge expenses included in overhead pools (e.g.,\naccounting services, legal services, building occupancy and maintenance, etc.) as\ndirect costs. 3) Organizations with an approved indirect cost rate, utilizing total direct costs as the\nbase, usually exclude contracts under awards or corporation agreements from any\noverhead recovery. The negotiation agreement will stipulate that major subcontracts\nare excluded from the base for overhead recovery. The term subcontract means any\ncontract awarded under the award or corporation agreement. DOJ policy requires\nthat participant support costs be excluded from the indirect cost base NO APPROVED PLAN If a recipient does not have an approved Federal indirect cost rate, funds budgeted for\nindirect costs will not be recoverable until a rate is approved.

Exception: If OMB has not assigned a Federal agency with cognizance for a local\njurisdiction, then the unit of government is not required to submit its indirect cost\nproposal, unless the new cognizant agency (based on preponderance of Federal dollars)\nrequires a copy of the proposal. 2014 Version Page 83 OVW can negotiate an Indirect Cost Rate if the recipient has a current award with OVW\nand the majority of Federal funding received by the recipient is from OVW. ESTABLISHMENT OF INDIRECT COST RATES\n1) In order to be reimbursed for indirect costs, a recipient must first establish an\nappropriate indirect cost rate. To do this, the recipient must prepare an indirect cost\nrate proposal and submit it to the cognizant Federal agency. The cognizant Federal\nagency is generally determined based on the preponderance of Federal dollars\nreceived by the recipient. Instructions on how to negotiate an indirect cost rate are\navailable at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/funding/pdfs/indirect_costs.pdf. 2) Local units of government need only submit their cost allocation plans and indirect\ncost proposals, if specifically requested by their cognizant Federal agency assigned\nby OMB. 3) The proposal must be submitted in a timely manner (within 6 months after the end of\nthe fiscal year) to assure recovery of the full amount of allowable indirect costs. The\nproposal must be developed in accordance with principles and procedures\nappropriate to the type of institution involved. 4) To support the indirect cost proposal, Federal recipients are responsible for ensuring\nthat independent audits of their organizations are conducted in accordance with\nexisting Federal auditing and reporting standards set forth in OMB Circular A-133. This audit report must be submitted to the cognizant agency to support the indirect\ncost proposal. After negotiations, the cognizant agency will establish either a\nprovisional, final, or fixed-with-carry-forward indirect cost rate. 5) A signed certification from the grantee organization requesting an indirect cost rate\nmust accompany the indirect cost allocation plan. This organization must certify that\nthe indirect cost allocation plan only includes allowable costs. 6) Copies of brochures of indirect cost rates describing the procedures that may be\ninvolved in the computation may be obtained from the U.S. Superintendent of\nDocuments, U.S. Government Printing Office, Mail Stop: SSOP, Washington, DC\n20402–9328. Some of the most commonly requested brochures are:\n OASC-1 (Rev)—A Guide for Colleges and Universities, Cost Principles and\nProcedures for Establishing Indirect Cost Rates for Research Awards with the\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare.  OASMB-5 (Rev)—A Guide for Non-Profit Institutions, Cost Principles and\nProcedures for Establishing Indirect Cost and Other Rates for Awards with the\nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare.  ASMB C-10—A Guide for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments, Cost\nPrinciples and Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect\nCost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government.

DISTRIBUTION BASES Generally there are three distribution bases used to distribute indirect costs. They are:\n1) Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) - This base includes all direct costs incurred by\nthe organization with the exception of distorting items such as equipment, capital\nexpenditures, passthrough funds, and each major subcontract or subgrant over\n2014 Version Page 84 $25,000. Participant support costs are excluded from the base. DOJ policy requires\nOVW to exclude participant support costs from the base for rates that are negotiated\nwith OVW. Although some recipients may negotiate their organization’s indirect cost\nrate with another Federal agency, consideration should be given to exclude\nparticipant support costs as DOJ will not allow the indirect cost rate to be applied to\nparticipant support costs. 2) Direct Salaries and Wages - This base includes only the direct salaries and wages\nincurred by the organization. 3) Direct Salaries and Wages plus Fringe Benefits - This base includes only the direct\nsalary and wages and the direct fringe benefits incurred by the organization. COST ALLOCATION PLANS—CENTRAL SUPPORT SERVICES State agencies and local units of government may not charge to an award, the cost of\ncentral support services supplied by the State or local units of government except\npursuant to a cost allocation plan approved by the cognizant Federal agency. The rate\nwhich is to be applied may be on a fixed-with-carry-forward provision. APPROVING RATES FOR SUBRECIPIENTS This is the responsibility of the direct recipient.

However, recipients should start the closeout process as soon as the program is\ncompleted and all monies have been spent. This will enable accurate reporting of\nfinancial information on the financial statements. Unless OVW authorizes an extension, recipients must liquidate all obligations incurred\nunder the award not later than 90 calendar days after the end of the award period. OVW will make prompt payments to the recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under\nthe award being closed out and the recipient must promptly return all balances owed to\nOVW. Recipients must account for any real and personal property acquired with OVW funds or\nreceived from OVW during the award. INITIATION OF THE CLOSEOUT PROCESS The recipient must complete the financial reconciliation and ensure that all programmatic\nconditions and requirements have been met, and then the recipient can initiate the\ncloseout process. The closeout package is reviewed in GMS by the OVW Program\nOffice. Once approved, the closeout package is submitted to OVW GFMD for financial\nreconciliation."

If the financial reconciliation process reveals that refunds are due to OVW, the OVW\nGFMD will contact the award recipient to request the funds owed. 1) Cash Reconciliation - The recipient must perform a financial reconciliation at\ncloseout. The total cost of the project must be determined. If there was a requirement\nfor the recipient to provide a share of the project costs, match must be calculated\nbased on the actual total cost of the project. Any match must be reported on the\n2014 Version Page 86 FFR-425 (Federal Financial Report). The recipient should request reimbursement for\nany funds due to cover expenditures and obligations (incurred prior to the end date\nof the grant and liquidated no more than 90 days after end date) at award closeout. The recipient’s Federal expenditures (outlays) must be equal to or greater than the\ncash disbursements from OVW. 2) Drawdown of Funds - Recipients should request final drawdown for reimbursement\nof Federal expenditures made within the approved period in conjunction with the final\nFederal Financial Report. If funds are due to the grantee based on the results of the\nfinal financial reconciliation, then the grantee should submit their final payment\nrequest in GPRS prior to 90 days after the end of the award period or submission of\nthe closeout package in GMS (whichever is sooner). Payment requests made after\n90 days or after the closeout has been submitted in GMS require a manual payment\nrequest on the grantee’s letterhead and must be signed by an authorized\nrepresentative of the organization. 3) Recipient Closeout Requirements - Within 90 days after the end date of the award or\nany approved extension thereof (revised end date), the following must be submitted\nby the recipient to OVW:\na) Final Federal Financial Report - This FINAL report of expenditures must have no\nunliquidated obligations and must indicate the exact balance of unobligated\nfunds. Any unobligated/unexpended funds will be deobligated from the award\namount by OVW. Any match requirement must be met by the end of the grant\nperiod. Matching contributions must be reported on the final SF-425. Recipients,\nwho have drawn down funds in excess of their Federal expenditures, shall return\nunused funds to OVW at the same time they submit the final report.

If not paid within a reasonable period of time, OVW may\nreduce the debt by making an administrative offset against other requests for\nreimbursement, withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient, or taking\nother action permitted by law. OVW may refer the debt to the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury for collection. OVW and Treasury may add fees, interest, and penalties to the\noriginal amount of the debt owed. Failure to remit funds due to DOJ may result in withholding or freezing of funds on all\nother grants awarded to the grantee organization, and may impact future fiscal integrity\nreviews affecting future grant applications. LATER ALLOWANCES AND ADJUSTMENTS The closeout of a grant does not affect:\n1) OVW’s right to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or\nother review; 2) The grantee’s obligation to return any funds due as a result of later refunds,\ncorrections, or other transactions;\n3) Records retention;\n4) Property management requirements; and\n5) Audit requirements. 2014 Version Page 88 Chapter 2: Audit Requirements\nHIGHLIGHTS OF CHAPTER:\nAudit Threshold\nAudit Objectives\nAudit Reporting Requirements\nDue Dates for Audit Reports\nAudit Submission Requirements\nFailure to Comply\nResolution of Audit Reports\nAudit Confirmation Requests\nAudit Compliance\nTop Ten Audit Findings\nAudit of Subrecipients\nTechnical Assistance\nFull-Scope Auditing\nCommercial (For-Profit) Organizations\nDistribution of Audit Reports\nOIG Regional Offices This chapter establishes responsibilities for the audit of organizations receiving agency\nfunds.

The intent of this chapter is to identify the policies for determining the proper and\neffective use of public funds rather than to prescribe detailed procedures for the conduct\nof an audit. AUDIT THRESHOLD\n1) Non-Federal entities that expend $500,000 or more in Federal funds (from all\nsources including passthrough subawards) in the organization’s fiscal year shall\nhave a single organization-wide audit conducted in accordance with the provisions of\nOMB Circular A-133. 2) Non-Federal entities that expend less than $500,000 a year in Federal awards are\nexempt from Federal audit requirements for that year. However, records must be\navailable for review or audit by appropriate officials including the Federal agency,\npass-through entity, and Government Accountability Office. AUDIT OBJECTIVES Awards are subject to conditions of fiscal, program, and general administration to which\nthe recipient expressly agrees in accepting the award. Accordingly, the audit objective is\nto review the recipient’s administration of funds and required non-Federal contributions\nfor the purpose of determining whether the recipient has: 1) Established an accounting system integrated with adequate internal fiscal and\nmanagement controls to provide full accountability for revenues, expenditures,\nassets, and liabilities. This system should provide reasonable assurance that the\n2014 Version Page 89 organization is managing Federal financial assistance programs in compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations. 2) Prepared financial statements which are presented fairly, in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. 3) Submitted financial reports which contain accurate and reliable financial data, and\nare presented in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements. 4) Expended Federal funds in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements and\nthose provisions of Federal law or regulations that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements or on the awards tested. AUDIT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Independent auditors should follow the requirements prescribed in OMB Circular A-133. The recipient’s books of account must support all amounts reported to OVW. The\nrecipient’s financial activity reported to OVW should reconcile to the amounts reported\non the grantee’s audited financial statements. If there are any differences between the\nrecipient’s audited financial statements and the financial activity reported to OVW, the\nrecipient must be able to explain the differences. If the auditor becomes aware of illegal acts or other irregularities, prompt notice shall be\ngiven to recipient management officials above the level of involvement. The recipient, in\nturn, shall promptly notify the cognizant Federal agency and/or OVW of the illegal acts or\nirregularities and of proposed and actual actions, if any. Costs of audits not required or performed in accordance with OMB Circular A-133 are\nunallowable without prior written approval from OVW. If the grantee did not expend\n$500,000 or more in Federal funds during the organization’s fiscal year and did not\nreceive prior written approval for audit costs, but contracted with a certified public\naccountant to perform an audit, these costs may not be charged to the grant.
