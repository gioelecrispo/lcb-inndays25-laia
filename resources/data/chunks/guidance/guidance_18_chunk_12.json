Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). 2 C.F.R §§ 200.327 –\n200.328. The progress report is used to track your agency’s progress toward implementing school safety strategies\nand to collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing the recipient’s capacity to improve school safety\nthrough COPS Office funding. The Federal Financial Report is used to track the expenditures of the recipient’s award\nfunds on a cumulative basis throughout the life of the award. Why this condition:\nFederal regulations and policies require that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government must be\nmonitored carefully to ensure the proper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on\na continuing basis, the progress of our programs and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with SVPP\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the “Account Access” tab on the COPS Office website at\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard\nForm 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days\nafter the end of the award period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during\nthe funding period, and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your 11 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner’s Manual\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date;\nhowever, you will have a 90-day grace period after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for\neligible expenditures incurred before the award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic\nor financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable\nexpenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports\nare discussed in greater detail in the section titled “Reporting Requirements” in this manual. All reports should be\nsubmitted within the deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial\nactions; failure to submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal regulations requires that recipients receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be monitored to\nensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutes and regulations. The COPS Office is\nalso interested in tracking the progress of our programs and implementing evidence-based school safety strategies\nand programs. Both aspects of award implementation—compliance and programmatic benefits—are part of the\nmonitoring process coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the\nCOPS Office may include site visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and\nprogrammatic reporting, and audit resolution."
