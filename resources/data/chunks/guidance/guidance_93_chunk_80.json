As a general rule, explain how you derived every cost that you include in the conference submission form. For\nlines that do not provide space for you to add descriptive narrative, include your explanations and speciﬁc cost\nbreakdowns in a separate tab or in a separate document that is submitted with the form. In addition, include\nthe cooperative agreement or contract number on the form. 16. What events qualify for the expedited review process? There is no expedited review process. Every eﬀort is made to review all events as quickly as possible. Most delays result from a need for additional information. Event requests are prioritized for review by\nbalancing the following three criteria:\n• The start date of the event;\n• The date the event submission was received by COPS Oﬃce; and\n• The overall cost and complexity of the event. For example, conferences requiring approval by the assistant\nattorney general’s administration and the deputy attorney general (over $100,000–$250,000) typically take\nlonger to process, as they must go through COPS Oﬃce and DOJ reviews, result in more questions, and are\nmore likely to have issues related to cost thresholds. Reporting\n17. Where can I ﬁnd the most updated version of the conference reporting form to use for my submissions? The most updated version of the conference reporting form can be found under the Training Resources for\naward recipients section on the COPS Office Training page at https://cops.usdoj.gov/training. 18. If I have a question about conference reporting, to whom should I send it? Send your questions to your designated Program Manager. They are great resources and will be happy to\nassist you. 19. Are we expected to have our staﬀ track their time hour for hour for time spent on the event for planning,\netc., or are reasonable estimates adequate for cost reporting purposes? Post-event reports must contain actual costs, not estimates. These costs should include logistical and\nprogrammatic planner staﬀ time spent on these activities and any contracted planner costs. 88 With conference cost reports now being due 30 days after the event, how should we handle costs for\ninvoices that have not been received yet? Many invoices (such as for hotels) are not received within 30 days\nafter the event. Should estimates be included on the cost report? All conference costs for events held by cooperative agreement recipients or contractors costing more than\n$20,000, or where more than 50% of attendees are DOJ employees, must be reported within 45 calendar days\nafter the last day of the event. 20. On the DOJ Conference & Events Submission Form under “A. General Conference Information,” is item 19,\n“Reporting Period,” the period in which the actual cost of the event is being reported, or should this be\nbased on the end date of the event? This reporting requirement is based on the end date of the event."
