Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using award funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with the\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. By signing the Reviews and Certifications in the application, the recipient\nassured the COPS Office that it will comply with the requirements of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found in 28 C.F.R. Part 23. An\n“interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system” is generally defined as a system that receives, stores, analyzes,\nexchanges, or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal information systems that protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use award funds to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms of technology)\nand will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not apply to your\naward. What you should do:\nRecipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence Systems/28 C.F.R. Part 23\nas part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to use their award funds to\noperate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use award funds to operate an\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should have indicated this in your application and certified your\nagency’s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Your agency now must\ncomply with 28 C.F.R. Part 23 in operating the interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system funded through your\nPASS award. 31. State Information Technology Point of Contact\nCondition: The recipient agrees to ensure that the appropriate State Information Technology Point of Contact receives written\nnotification regarding any technology or information-sharing project funded by this award during the obligation\nand expenditure period. This is to facilitate communication among local and state governmental entities regarding\nvarious information technology projects being conducted with these award funds. In addition, the recipient agrees\nto maintain an administrative file documenting the meeting of this requirement. For a list of State Information\nTechnology Points of Contact, go to https://it.ojp.gov/technology-contacts. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office is committed to promoting communication between state and local law enforcement. What you should do: 35 2019 COPS Office Preparing for Active Shooter Situations (PASS) Program Award Owner’s Manual If applicable, upon receiving the award, your agency should contact your state information technology point of\ncontact for further guidance. Please visit the Justice Information Sharing homepage at\nhttps://it.ojp.gov/technology-contacts and identify your appropriate contact.
