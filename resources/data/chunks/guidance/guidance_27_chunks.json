Hurwitz\nActing Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons\n1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n§571.60 Purpose and scope. Under 18 U.S.C. 4205(g), a sentencing court, on motion of the Bureau of\nPrisons, may make an inmate with a minimum term sentence immediately\neligible for parole by reducing the minimum term of the sentence to time served. Under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A), a sentencing court, on motion of the Director of\nthe Bureau of Prisons, may reduce the term of imprisonment of an inmate\nsentenced under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. The Bureau uses 18 U.S.C. 4205(g) and 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A) in particularly\nextraordinary or compelling circumstances which could not reasonably have\nbeen foreseen by the court at the time of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. 3582 was amended by the First Step Act of 2018, revisions noted below in Summary\nof Changes. For the purposes of this Program Statement, the terms “compassionate release” and “reduction\nin sentence” are used interchangeably. Federal Regulations from 28 CFR are in this type. Implementing information is in this type. In deciding whether to file a motion under either 18 U.S.C. 4205(g) or 18 U.S.C. 3582, the\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) should consider whether the inmate’s release would pose a danger to\nthe safety of any other person or the community. Under 18 USC 3582 (d)(2)(3), the Bureau ensures that all facilities regularly and visibly post,\nincluding in prisoner handbooks, staff training materials, and facility law libraries and medical\nand hospice facilities, and make available to prisoners upon demand, notice of—\n(i) a defendant’s ability to request a sentence reduction pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A);\n(ii) the procedures and timelines for initiating and resolving requests described in clause (i); and\n(iii) the right to appeal a denial of a request described in clause (i) after all administrative rights\nto appeal within the Bureau of Prisons have been exhausted. §572.40 Compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. 4205(g).\n18 U.S.C. 4205(g) was repealed effective November 1, 1987, but remains the\ncontrolling law for inmates whose offenses occurred prior to that date. For\ninmates whose offenses occurred on or after November 1, 1987, the applicable\nstatute is 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Procedures for compassionate release of an\ninmate under either provision are contained in 28 CFR part 571, subpart G.\na. Program Objectives. The expected results of this program are:\n■ A motion for a modification of a sentence will be made to the sentencing court only in\nparticularly extraordinary or compelling circumstances that could not reasonably have been\nforeseen by the court at the time of sentencing. ■ The public will be protected from undue risk by careful review of each compassionate release\nrequest. ■ Compassionate release motions will be filed with the sentencing judge in accordance with the\nstatutory requirements of 18 U.S.C. 3582 or 4205(g). b.

Implementing information: this type. 2 The following have been added to this version of the Program Statement:\n■ Requirements of section 603(b) of the First Step Act, codified at 18 USC § 3582:\n Requiring inmates be informed of reduction in sentence availability and process;\n Modifying definition of “terminally ill;”\n Requiring notice and assistance for terminally ill offenders;\n Requiring requests from terminally ill offenders to be processed within 14 days;\n Requiring notice and assistance for debilitated offenders; and\n Specifying inmates may file directly to court after exhaustion of administrative\nremedies, or 30 days from receipt of a request by the Warden’s Office. 2. INITIATION OF REQUEST – EXTRAORDINARY OR COMPELLING\nCIRCUMSTANCES\n§ 571.61 Initiation of request – extraordinary or compelling circumstances. a. A request for a motion under 18 U.S.C. 4205(g) or 3582(c)(1)(A) shall be\nsubmitted to the Warden. Ordinarily, the request shall be in writing, and\nsubmitted by the inmate. An inmate may initiate a request for consideration\nunder 18 U.S.C. 4205(g) or 3582(c)(1)(A) only when there are particularly\nextraordinary or compelling circumstances which could not reasonably have\nbeen foreseen by the court at the time of sentencing. The inmate’s request shall\nat a minimum contain the following information:\n(1) The extraordinary or compelling circumstances that the inmate believes\nwarrant consideration. (2) Proposed release plans, including where the inmate will reside, how the\ninmate will support himself/herself, and, if the basis for the request involves the\ninmate’s health, information on where the inmate will receive medical treatment,\nand how the inmate will pay for such treatment. b. The Bureau of Prisons processes a request made by another person on behalf\nof an inmate in the same manner as an inmate’s request. Staff shall refer a\nrequest received at the Central Office to the Warden of the institution where the\ninmate is confined. A request for a RIS is considered “submitted” for the purposes of 18 USC §3582 (c)(1), when\nreceived by the Warden in accordance with this section. P5050.50 1/17/2019 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing information: this type. 3 3. REQUESTS BASED ON MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES The criteria for a reduction in sentence (RIS) request may include the following:\na. Terminal Medical Condition. RIS consideration may be given to inmates who have been\ndiagnosed with a terminal, incurable disease and whose life expectancy is eighteen (18) months\nor less, and/or has a disease or condition with an end-of-life trajectory under 18 USC §\n3582(d)(1). The BOP’s consideration should include assessment of the primary (terminal)\ndisease, prognosis, impact of other serious medical conditions of the inmate, and degree of\nfunctional impairment (if any). Functional impairment (e.g., limitations on activities of daily\nliving such as feeding and dressing oneself) is not required for inmates diagnosed with terminal\nmedical conditions; however, functional impairment may be a factor when considering the\ninmate’s ability or inability to reoffend."

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(d)(2)(A), in the case of a diagnosis of a terminal illness, the Bureau\nof Prisons shall, subject to confidentiality requirements:\n(i) not later than 72 hours after the diagnosis notify the defendant’s attorney, partner,\nand family members of the defendant’s condition and inform the defendant’s attorney,\npartner, and family members that they may prepare and submit on the defendant’s\nbehalf a request for a sentence reduction pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A);\n(ii) not later than 7 days after the date of the diagnosis, provide the defendant’s partner\nand family members (including extended family) with an opportunity to visit the\ndefendant in person;\n(iii) upon request from the defendant or his attorney, partner, or a family member,\nensure that Bureau of Prisons employees assist the defendant in the preparation,\ndrafting, and submission of a request for a sentence reduction pursuant to subsection\n(c)(1)(A); and\n(iv) not later than 14 days of receipt of a request for a sentence reduction submitted on\nthe defendant’s behalf by the defendant or the defendant’s attorney, partner, or family\nmember, process the request. The statutory time frames of section 3582(d)(2)(A), begin once the Clinical Director of an\ninstitution makes a terminal diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is made, the Clinical Director will\ninform the Warden and the appropriate Unit Manager as soon as possible so as to ensure\nrequirements are met. P5050.50 1/17/2019 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing information: this type. 4 If the inmate is physically/psychologically able, the inmate should consent to notifications\nabove using Form BP-A0192, Release of Information Consent, or equivalent written\nauthorization. If a visit is denied for security concerns, as reflected in 18 U.S.C. § 3582(d)(3)(J), the reasons\nshould be documented. The Warden will forward the information indicated in Section 8 of this policy, below, to\nCentral Office within 14 days. b. Debilitated Medical Condition. RIS consideration may also be given to inmates who have\nan incurable, progressive illness or who have suffered a debilitating injury from which they will\nnot recover. The BOP should consider a RIS if the inmate is:\n■ Completely disabled, meaning the inmate cannot carry on any self-care and is totally\nconfined to a bed or chair; or\n■ Capable of only limited self-care and is confined to a bed or chair more than 50% of waking\nhours. The BOP’s review should also include any cognitive deficits of the inmate (e.g., Alzheimer’s\ndisease or traumatic brain injury that has affected the inmate’s mental capacity or function). A\ncognitive deficit is not required in cases of severe physical impairment, but may be a factor when\nconsidering the inmate’s ability or inability to reoffend."

REQUESTS BASED ON NON-MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES – ELDERLY\nINMATES The criteria for a RIS request may include the following:\na. “New Law” Elderly Inmates. Inmates sentenced for an offense that occurred on or after\nNovember 1, 1987 (e.g., “new law”), who are age 70 years or older and have served 30 years or\nmore of their term of imprisonment. 1\nb. Elderly Inmates with Medical Conditions. Inmates who fit the following criteria:\n■ Age 65 and older. ■ Suffer from chronic or serious medical conditions related to the aging process. ■ Experiencing deteriorating mental or physical health that substantially diminishes their\nability to function in a correctional facility. ■ Conventional treatment promises no substantial improvement to their mental or physical\ncondition. ■ Have served at least 50% of their sentence. Additionally, for inmates in this category, the BOP should consider the following factors when\nevaluating the risk that an elderly inmate may reoffend:\n■ The age at which the inmate committed the current offense. ■ Whether the inmate suffered from these medical conditions at the time the inmate committed\nthe offense. ■ Whether the inmate suffered from these medical conditions at the time of sentencing and\nwhether the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) mentions these conditions. The BOP Medical Director will develop and issue medical criteria to help evaluate the inmate’s\nsuitability for consideration under this RIS category. c. Other Elderly Inmates. Inmates age 65 or older who have served the greater of 10 years or\n75% of the term of imprisonment to which the inmate was sentenced. 1"

Inmates age 65 or older who have served the greater of 10 years or\n75% of the term of imprisonment to which the inmate was sentenced. 1 These criteria are different from those provided in 18 U.S.C 3582(c)(1)(a)(ii), which states that a court, upon\nmotion of the BOP Director, may reduce a sentence term if it finds that “the defendant is at least 70 years of age,\nhas served at least 30 years in prison, pursuant to a sentence imposed under section 3559(c), for the offense or\noffenses for which the defendant is currently imprisoned, and a determination has been made by the Director of\nthe Bureau of Prisons that the defendant is not a danger to the safety of any other person or the community, as\nprovided under section 3142(g).” P5050.50 1/17/2019 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing information: this type. 6 Elderly inmates who were age 60 or older at the time they were sentenced ordinarily should not\nbe considered for RIS if their current conviction is listed in the Categorization of Offenses\nProgram Statement. All RIS requests should be assessed using the factors outlined in Section 7. 5. REQUESTS BASED ON NON-MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES – DEATH OR\nINCAPACITATION OF THE FAMILY MEMBER CAREGIVER. The criteria for a RIS request may include the death or incapacitation of the family member\ncaregiver of an inmate’s child, e.g., RIS requests from inmates whose biological or legally\nadopted child or children (“child”) are suddenly without a family member caregiver due to that\ncaregiver’s death or incapacitation. For these requests, “child” means a person under the age of 18 and “incapacitation” means the\nfamily member caregiver suffered a severe injury (e.g., auto accident) or suffers from a severe\nillness (e.g., cancer) that renders the caregiver incapable of caring for the child. In reviewing these requests, BOP should assess, based on the information provided, whether\nrelease of the inmate to care for the inmate’s child is in the best interest of the child. a. First Stage of the Warden’s Review. The following information should be provided by the\ninmate to the Warden in writing for RIS requests based on the death or incapacitation of the\nfamily member caregiver:\n■ A statement that explains that the inmate’s family member caregiver has died or become\nincapacitated and that person was the caregiver for the inmate’s biological or legally adopted\nchild. ■ A statement that this person was the only family member capable of caring for the inmate’s\nchild.\n■ The name of the deceased or incapacitated family member caregiver and the relationship of\nthat person to the inmate (e.g., spouse, common-law spouse, mother, sister) and statement\nthat the caregiver is a family member of the child. ■ For requests based on a deceased family member caregiver, an official copy of the family\nmember caregiver’s death certificate. ■ For requests based on an incapacitated family member caregiver, verifiable medical\ndocumentation of the incapacitation. ■ Verifiable documentation that the inmate is the parent of the child. Acceptable\ndocumentation includes birth certificates, adoption papers, or verification of the inmate’s\npaternity. P5050.50 1/17/2019 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type."

The Warden may deny the inmate’s request at the institution level of review if the Warden finds\nthat the inmate has not provided adequate information and documentation as set forth above. b. Second Stage of the Warden’s Review. Even if the inmate provides adequate and sufficient\ninformation and documentation set forth above regarding the RIS request, further investigation is\nappropriate. At this stage, the Warden should convene a committee consisting of the inmate’s\nunit manager, correctional counselor, and any other relevant staff (social worker, physician,\npsychologist, etc.) to investigate the facts and circumstances provided by the inmate and to\nreview supporting letters and documents before the Warden makes a recommendation to approve\nor deny the RIS request. The additional information and supporting documentation gathered by\nthe committee for the Warden’s review should include:\n■ A general description of the child’s physical and mental condition. ■ A description of the nature of the child’s care both during the inmate’s pre-arrest and presentence period, and during the inmate’s current incarceration. ■ Letters or documentation that the deceased/incapacitated family member was and still is the\nonly family member caregiver capable of caring for the inmate’s minor child.

Wardens should also consider any additional reliable documentation (e.g., letters of support from\nfamily members, neighbors, doctors, hospitals, and state or local agencies). Documentation may\nbe obtained with the assistance of the Office of Probation and Pretrial Services. Wardens should\nalso consider whether the inmate participated in the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program\nand any information relating to the inmate’s substance abuse treatment, physical/mental/\nemotional health, and work evaluations during incarceration. The care of a child may be requested to be a condition of the inmate’s release to a supervised\nrelease term. Thus, failure to care for the child may result in a finding of a supervised release\nviolation and return to custody. 6. REQUESTS BASED ON NON-MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES – INCAPACITATION\nOF A SPOUSE OR REGISTERED PARTNER The criteria for a RIS request may include the incapacitation of an inmate’s spouse or registered\npartner when the inmate would be the only available caregiver for the spouse or registered\npartner. For these requests, “spouse” means an individual in a relationship with the inmate, where that\nrelationship has been legally recognized as a marriage, including a legally-recognized commonlaw marriage. “Registered partner” means an individual in a relationship with the inmate, where\nthat relationship has been legally recognized as a civil union or registered domestic partnership. P5050.50 1/17/2019 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing information: this type. 9 The relationship should have been established before the inmate’s offense date of arrest, and\nshould be verified by information in the PSR or other administratively acceptable documentation\n(e.g. marriage certificate)."

FACTORS AND EVALUATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN RIS REQUESTS For all RIS requests, the following factors should be considered:\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■\n■ Nature and circumstances of the inmate’s offense. Criminal history. Comments from victims. Unresolved detainers. Supervised release violations. Institutional adjustment. Disciplinary infractions. Personal history derived from the PSR. Length of sentence and amount of time served. This factor is considered with respect to\nproximity to release date or Residential Reentry Center (RRC) or home confinement date. Inmate’s current age. Inmate’s age at the time of offense and sentencing. Inmate’s release plans (employment, medical, financial). Whether release would minimize the severity of the offense. When reviewing RIS requests, these factors are neither exclusive nor weighted. These factors\nshould be considered to assess whether the RIS request presents particularly extraordinary and\ncompelling circumstances. Overall, for each RIS request, the BOP should consider whether the inmate’s release would pose\na danger to the safety of any other person or the community. 8.

(2) If the General Counsel determines that the request warrants approval, the\nGeneral Counsel shall solicit the opinion of either the Medical Director or the\nAssistant Director, Correctional Programs Division depending upon the nature of\nthe basis for the request.
