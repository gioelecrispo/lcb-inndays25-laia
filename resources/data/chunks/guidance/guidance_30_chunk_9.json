Reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to services or benefits may\ninclude interpretation or translation services, where appropriate. For additional information, see “Civil Rights\nCompliance.” Other costs Items that do not conform to any of the category descriptions specific above but that have a direct correlation to\nthe overall success of a recipient’s project objectives and are necessary for the project to reach full\nimplementation will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the COPS Office. If at any time you are unsure if an item is considered allowable or unallowable, please contact your COPS Office\nGrant Program Specialist for further assistance.

Comprehensive School Safety Assessments\nCondition:\nRecipients awarded funding through the SVPP must conduct comprehensive school safety assessments for all\nschools involved in the funded project within the 24-month grant implementation period. The assessments should\nbe completed as soon as possible as they can be used as strategic evaluation tools to identify school safety issues\nand potential resolutions. This condition can be waived for recipients that can demonstrate that comprehensive\nschool safety assessments have already been performed or updated within the previous three years. The COPS\nOffice will monitor SVPP grants to ensure that recipients comply with this condition. 8 2018 COPS Office STOP School Violence: School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition: In order for school safety interventions to be most effective, they should be incorporated into broader school\nsafety planning and assessment efforts and be designed to meet the unique individualized needs of each school\nand challenges of each jurisdiction and each school at which they will be implemented. Comprehensive school\nsafety assessments examine the overall safety, accessibility and emergency preparedness of school buildings and\nground and are essential to school safety decision making. Information about conducting site assessments,\nincluding free assessment software can be found at https://rems.ed.gov/SITEASSESS.aspx. What you should do:\nAgencies should keep record of the date(s) of the assessment(s) as well as specific areas of the school(s) where\nproblems were identified and the proposed (if any) recommendations for resolution. Participants (law\nenforcement, teachers, students, any staff, et cetera) should also be included. Please contact your Grant Program\nSpecialist at 800-421-6770 or at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable\njustification for delays will be granted no-cost extensions."
