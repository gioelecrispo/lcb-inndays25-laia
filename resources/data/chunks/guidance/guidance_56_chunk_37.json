If you are a new award recipient to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on the\nCOPS Office website at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf. Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 7th Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 Your agency must complete the “Payee/Company Information” section following the directions on the back of the\nform and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial institution must\ncomplete the “Financial Institution Information” section and have the appropriate financial official sign the form. If you are already a COPS Office award recipient, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long as\nyour OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment form\ninformation, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Financial Analyst. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? Current regulations state that once you return a signed award document, your agency is required to submit a\nFederal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) at the end of every calendar quarter regardless of\naward activity. This report should reflect actual expenditures and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency\non a cumulative basis. You will not be able to make drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 report for\nthe most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Recipients are\nencouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov.” For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see the section of this\nAward Owner’s Manual titled “Reporting Requirements.” Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. 38 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of “minimum cash on hand” applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the recipient\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4. is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\nmaintains excess cash on hand;\ndoes not adhere to the terms and conditions of the award;\nfails to submit reliable and/or timely reports."
