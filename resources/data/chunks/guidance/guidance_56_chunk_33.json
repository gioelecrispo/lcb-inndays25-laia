However, in\nsome instances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: If you have received an award for an item (or group of items) or service in excess of $250,000 and have already\ndetermined that the award of a contract through a competitive process is unfeasible, you must provide a written\njustification that explains why it is necessary to contract noncompetitively. The initial determination that competition is not feasible can be made if one of the following circumstances exists::\n•\n•\n•\n• Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. The COPS Office authorizes noncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the recipient. The item/service is available only from one source. The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive\nsolicitation. The COPS Office will review your request and the supporting information that you provide and will make a\ndetermination as to whether or not an exception can be made to the general rule regarding competition. If\nsubmitting a sole source justification request to the COPS Office, please use the format described in the “Sole\nSource Justification fact sheet” in appendices of this manual.. 30.

To coordinate rapid\nand targeted responses to overdose events and to support investigative efforts, CAMP award recipients must\nshare information with federal, state, local, and tribal public safety partners.
