  "chunk_text": "Appeal procedures will follow those in the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice regulations in 28 C.F.R. Part 18. Awards terminated due to noncompliance with the federal statutes, regulations, or award terms and conditions\nwill be reported to the integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently FAPIIS). False statements or claims made in connection with COPS Office awards may result in fines, imprisonment,\ndebarment from participating in federal awards or contracts, and any other remedy available by law. Please be advised that recipients may not use COPS Office funding for the same item or service also funded by\nanother U.S. Department of Justice award. Accepting the award After you have reviewed the conditions of your COPS Office CPD Program award and your agency agrees with\nthese conditions, you are ready to accept the award. The Director (or Acting Director) of the COPS Office has\nsigned the award document indicating approval of your award, an obligation of federal funds to your organization,\nand our commitment to the award. As stated at the beginning of this section, to officially begin your award and\ndraw down your funds, the authorized officials (see the Glossary of Terms in this manual) must access\nhttps://portal.cops.usdoj.gov to log in, review, and electronically sign the award document with the award terms\nand conditions; the Financial Clearance Memorandum and, if applicable, the cooperative agreement that is\nincorporated by reference into the award document; and, if applicable, the special award conditions and high risk\nconditions in the award document supplement within 90 days of the date shown on the award congratulatory\nletter. Please see the Agency Portal User Manual at\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2018AwardDocs/Agency_Portal_GrantsMgt_Manual.pdf for detailed instructions on\naward acceptance. Who should sign the award document for our agency? The authorized officials are the law enforcement and government executives who have ultimate and final\nresponsibility for all programmatic and financial decisions regarding this award as representatives of the legal\nrecipient. COPS Office awards require that both the top law enforcement executive (e.g., chief of police, sheriff, or\nequivalent) and the top government executive (e.g., mayor, board chairman, or equivalent) sign the award\ndocument. For non–law enforcement agencies (institutions of higher education, private organizations, etc.), the\nauthorized officials are the programmatic and financial officials who have the ultimate signatory authority to sign\ncontracts on behalf of your organization. Typically, these are the same executives who signed the forms in your\nCPD application package. If one or both of these individuals have changed, please complete a Change of\nInformation (COI) form online at https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2018_Change_of_Info_508d_Form.pdf (also\nincluded as appendix J on page 127). If you have any questions as to who should sign the award, please contact\nyour organization’s legal counsel. By when must the award document be signed? Please electronically sign the award document and all award condition pages within 90 days of the date on the\naward congratulatory letter. Award funds will not be released until we have received your agency’s signed award\ndocument, your budget has received final clearance, and any other relevant award conditions particular to your 40 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner’s Manual\nagency have been satisfied."
