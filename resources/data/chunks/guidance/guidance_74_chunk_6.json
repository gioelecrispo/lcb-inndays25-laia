Purchases must also reflect the costs that were approved in the FCM. What you should do:\nRefer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable cost categories (please see appendix K on page 129 for a\nsample FCM). Listed below are the budget categories that may appear on your FCM. If your agency’s operating\nbudget categories differ from those approved in the FCM, your agency should maintain a cross-reference to clearly\nidentify where the funds were budgeted. As long as funds are spent during the award period on project costs that\nwere documented in your application’s budget summary and approved by the COPS Office through the issuance of\nthe FCM, this award condition will be satisfied. The award number should be indicated on all budgetary\ndocumentation including purchase orders, receipts, and other documentation. All recipients should keep and\nmaintain the most recent, approved version of their 2019 LEMHWA application and FCM for future reference. For\nrecipients that are state, local, or Tribal Government entities, requests may be made only for items or positions\nthat are not otherwise budgeted with state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds and would not be funded\nin the absence of the LEMHWA award. 5 2019 COPS Office Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act (LEMHWA) Program Award Owner’s Manual\nPersonnel (salaries and benefits) Personnel expenses may be reimbursed for project activities that take place on or after the award start date.
