The authorized officials are the law enforcement and government executives who have ultimate and final\nresponsibility for all programmatic and financial decisions regarding this award as representatives of the legal\nrecipient. COPS Office awards require that both the top law enforcement executive (e.g., chief of police, sheriff, or\nequivalent) and the top government executive (e.g., mayor, board chairman, or equivalent) sign the award\ndocument. For non–law enforcement agencies (institutions of higher education, private organizations, etc.), the\nauthorized officials are the programmatic and financial officials who have the ultimate signatory authority to sign\ncontracts on behalf of your organization. Typically, these are the same executives who signed the forms in your\nCPD application package. If one or both of these individuals have changed, please complete a Change of\nInformation (COI) form online at https://cops.usdoj.gov/cpd#programdocuments (also included as appendix J on\npage 127).
