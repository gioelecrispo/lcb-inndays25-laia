  "chunk_text": "For nonfederal entities other than states, payment methods must minimize the time between your drawdown of\nfederal funds and your payment of award costs to avoid earning excess interest on your award funds. You must\naccount for interest earned on advances of federal funds as follows:\n• The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance at 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(9) states that\ninterest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year\nmay be retained by the nonfederal entity for administrative expenses. • Any interest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts that is in excess of\n$500 per year must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment\nManagement System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nnetwork or a Fedwire Funds Service payment. For detailed information on remittance, please see appendices\nfor a full text of the electronic medium remittance options. • If you do not have access to an electronic medium option, then please make a check payable to “The\nDepartment of Health and Human Services” and mail the check to Treasury-approved lockbox: HHS Program\nSupport Center, P.O. Box 530231, Atlanta, GA 30353-0231. (Please allow 4–6 weeks for processing of a\npayment by check to be applied to the appropriate Payment Management System (PMS) account). • Please notify your COPS Office Staff Accountant in the COPS Office Finance Business Unit when any interest\nthat is earned is remitted to the Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System.
