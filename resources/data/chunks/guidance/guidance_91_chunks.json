The 2014 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) provides funding\ndirectly to federally recognized tribal jurisdictions with established law enforcement agencies. TRGP was\ndesigned to expand the implementation of community policing and meet the most serious needs of law\nenforcement in tribal communities through a broadened comprehensive program. In Fiscal Year 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a single Coordinated Tribal Assistance\nSolicitation (CTAS) that encompasses the department’s available tribal government-specific grant programs. CTAS enabled each tribe to submit a single application for available grant funding according to the tribes’\nneeds. This coordinated process allowed DOJ to review a single application from a tribe, and it allowed the\nDOJ grant-making components to coordinate in making award decisions to address these public safety\nneeds on a more comprehensive basis. The 2014 TRGP, which was also CTAS Purpose Area #1: Public Safety and Community Policing, consists of\ntwo types of grants. The TRGP-Hiring grants are for entry-level salaries and benefits for newly-hired or rehired\ncareer law enforcement officers, and the TRGP-Equipment/Training (TRGP-E/T) grants provide funding for\nbackground investigations, training, uniforms, basic issue equipment, technology, and vehicles for tribal law\nenforcement agencies. To support community policing, particularly the development of partnerships and problem solving, 2014 TRGP\ngrantees may be offered training and technical assistance by COPS Office training and technical assistance\nproviders. Trainings will assist grantees in the advancement of community policing and may address specific\npublic safety issues facing tribal communities. The COPS Office or its technical assistance providers will notify\nTRGP grantees about training and technical assistance opportunities."

Your grant number is in the following format: 2014-HEWX-0000 for TRGP-E/T awards and 2014-HHWX-0000\nfor TRGP-Hiring grants awarded in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. The COPS Office tracks grant information based upon\nthis number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency’s grant number (or your agency’s ORI number)\nreadily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five\nnumbers or letters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for\nuse in tracking information for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic grant\ninformation based upon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI,\nthe COPS Office assigns a non-official ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two\ncharacters will be “ZZ”). If you have any questions regarding your grant, please refer to your grant number or\nyour agency’s ORI number when you contact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency’s nine- or\nthirteen-digit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your\nOJP vendor number differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used\nfor administrative purposes in connection with this grant program, and should not be used for IRS purposes. 2 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Grant conditions The grant conditions are listed on your agency’s award document.

Your agency may not use TRGP grant funds for any\ncosts that are not identified as allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual allowable costs incurred during the grant award period will be eligible for reimbursement and\ndrawdown. If your agency experiences any cost savings over the course of the grant (for example, your grant\napplication overestimated the total entry-level officer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use\nthat excess funding to extend the length of the grant beyond 36 months. Any funds remaining after your agency 4 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual has drawn down for the costs of approved salaries and fringe benefits incurred for each awarded position during\nthe 36-month funding period for each awarded position will be deobligated during the closeout process, and\nshould not be spent by your agency. Why this condition:\nTRGP-Hiring funds may be used only to pay entry-level salaries and fringe benefits for 36 months for career\nlaw enforcement officers hired or rehired on or after the award start date. You may use the TRGP grant to hire\nor rehire experienced officers, but grant funding must be limited to paying your agency’s entry-level salary\nand fringe benefits; any costs higher than entry level must be paid by your agency with local funds. TRGP-Hiring grant funding may also be used to pay the approved entry-level salaries and fringe benefits of\nnewly hired officer recruits while they are in basic academy training prior to swearing them in, if it is your\nagency’s standard practice to pay recruits while in training. What you should do: All grantees should keep and maintain the most recent, approved version of 2014 TRGP application, which\nwill contain the approved costs for this grant. Refer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable costs."

Refer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable costs. As long as funds are spent during the grant period on the approved salaries and benefits (as applicable),\nequipment, technology, training, or other costs that were documented in your application’s budget\nsummary and were approved through the issuance of the FCM, this grant condition will be satisfied. Salaries covered by TRGP-Hiring must be based on your agency’s standard entry-level salary and fringe\nbenefits package under the laws or rules that govern hiring by your agency. Salary and fringe benefits\npayments must be based on payroll records supported by time and attendance records or their equivalent. Examples of the types of records your agency must keep to document allowable costs are described in\nsection IV on page 48 of this manual. Any additional costs above the approved entry-level salaries and\nfringe benefits are the responsibility of the grantee agency. Civilian positions, overtime, training, weapons,\ncommunication equipment, and vehicles cannot be funded with your TRGP-Hiring grant. Allowable costs: Approved salary and benefits The FCM, included in your award package, specifies the approved amount of COPS TRGP-Hiring funds\nawarded to your agency for officer salaries and approved benefits. Please note that the salary and benefit\ncosts requested in your original application may have been updated or corrected from the original version\nsubmitted to the COPS Office. Your agency may only be reimbursed for the approved cost categories and\namounts that are documented within the FCM. In addition, your agency may not use TRGP funds for any\ncosts that are not identified as allowable in the FCM. Allowable costs: Indirect costs Indirect costs are costs that are incurred for common or joint purposes and are not readily assignable to\na particular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance of the project. Examples of indirect costs include those incurred for facility operation and maintenance, depreciation,\nand administrative salaries. Indirect costs must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) costs principles for your entity, 2 C.F.R. Part 225, Appendix E (state, local,\nand Indian tribal governments); 2 C.F.R. Part 230, Appendix A (non-profit organizations); or 2 C.F.R. Part 220,\nAppendix A (educational institutions). Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses that are approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency\ncarefully track and update its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office grant award period. 5 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual The grantee understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of\napplication, it will be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a\ncurrent indirect cost rate agreement covering the award period."

      "content": "The grantee understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of\napplication, it will be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a\ncurrent indirect cost rate agreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the\naward prohibiting the obligation, expenditure, or drawdown of funds reimbursement for indirect costs until\nan indirect cost rate has been approved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS Office. If your agency’s approved indirect cost rate expires during the grant award period, a current approved rate\nmust be submitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down grant funding for indirect costs. Your agency must advise the COPS Office in writing of any changes to your approved indirect cost rate\nduring the grant award period and must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect any\nrate change. In addition, before the COPS Office officially closes-out your agency’s grant award, your agency must\nreconcile any changes between your approved final indirect cost rate and approved provisional indirect cost\nrate and, if necessary, repay the COPS Office for any indirect cost rate overpayment. If your agency draws\ndown excess COPS Office grant funding for indirect costs, please return the overpayment to the COPS Office\nand submit a revised Federal Financial Report (SF-425). See the COPS Office website for a fact sheet on indirect costs, www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=2489. 4. Supplementing, not supplanting\nState, local, and tribal governments must use TRGP grant funds to supplement, and not supplant, state, local, or BIA\nfunds that are already committed or otherwise would have been committed for grant purposes (hiring, training,\npurchases, and/or activities) during the grant period . In other words, grantees may not use COPS funds to supplant\n(replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to the COPS-funded item(s) in the absence of the\nCOPS grant . Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory non-supplanting requirement mandates that grant funds may not be used to\nreplace state or local funds (or, for tribal grantees, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be\nmade available for the grant purposes. What you should do:\nTRGP-Hiring grantees may not use grant funds to pay for any item or cost funded under the grant\n(equipment, personnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA\nfunds, or committed to the grantee’s budget. TRGP-Hiring – To meet this grant condition, you must ensure that the following: • If your agency is redeploying a current employee to perform the work duties of the TRGP-Hiring position, the redeployed position must be paid with local funds. The COPS Office grant funds may be\nused to backfill the resulting vacancy with newly-hired personnel for an equivalent amount of time. Each individual employed under the TRGP-Hiring grant must be newly hired or rehired on or after the\ngrant award start date unless an exception is authorized in writing by the COPS Office."

Your agency may not cancel or postpone\nspending money in its budget that is committed to hiring other new officers. 6 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual • Your agency must take active and timely steps to fill any vacancies that were created on or after the date of your grant application by retirement, resignation, or other reasons with new officers in addition\nto your TRGP-Hiring grant-funded positions. Note: This grant condition applies to all state or locally-funded agencies working in partnership with your\nagency under this grant. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any partner agencies use COPS Office\nfunds only to supplement, not supplant, their state, local, or BIA funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nYour agency may request an extension of the grant award period to receive additional time to implement your\ngrant program . Such extensions do not provide additional funding . Grants may be extended a maximum of 36\nmonths beyond the initial award expiration date . Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated\non a case-by-case basis . Only those grantees that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted\nno-cost extensions . Reasonable justifications may include difficulties in filling COPS-funded positions, officer\nturnover, or other circumstances that interrupt the 36-month grant funding period . An extension allows your\nagency to compensate for such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding for\neach position awarded . Extension requests must be received prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the grant award period require prior written approval from\nthe COPS Office. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal\nfunding for costs incurred beyond the official grant award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office\nseeks to accommodate reasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the\nCOPS Office grant. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the grant award period to determine\nwhether a no-cost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days before the\ngrant end date. Requests to extend the grant award period must be received by the COPS Office before the\nofficial grant award end date."

      "content": "Requests to extend the grant award period must be received by the COPS Office before the\nofficial grant award end date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will be considered only\nwhen the grantee provides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an\ninstance in which an unforeseen natural disaster prevented a grantee from requesting an extension. Failure\nto submit a request for a no-cost time extension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation\nof any remaining grant funds. Automatic extensions will be granted for grantee requests of six months or less. All extension requests\nbeyond six months will require review and approval by the COPS Office. Individual or cumulative requests\ngreater than one-half of the grant’s original term (i.e., 18 months) will require additional justification and\nmust include a detailed timeline. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the grant due to salary and fringe benefits costs that\nwere lower than anticipated, your agency may not extend the 36-month funding period for the purpose of\nexpending those excess funds. Grantees are entitled to a maximum of 36 months of federal funding based\non the approved salary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM.

Modifications\nOccasionally, a change in an agency’s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its TRGP award. Grant modifications under TRGP are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All modification requests involving the\npurchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their implementation. In\naddition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that results in an increase\nof federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram grant funds. Acceptable examples of such\naward modifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items,\nor purchasing a different type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may\nexpend grant funds only as approved in the FCM. Any requests to change or alter grant awards require\nwritten approval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Without prior written approval, you\nmust continue to implement your grant as it was originally awarded and accepted by your agency. Please be\nadvised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be approved (e.g., construction). What you should do: For all modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the “Account Access” link\nin the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office, providing the proposed\nchanges, details of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific grant modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing."

Please note that modification approvals for\nactive grants will often be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes. If applicable, your agency is required to sign and submit the modified award document via the “Account\nAccess” link to officially accept the grant modification. 7. Evaluations\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS Tribal Resources Grant\nProgram. The grantee agrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the Attorney General for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nact. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office\nmay assess the way in which your agency implements its grant. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or\nevaluators may study the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect\ninformation about the programs’ effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In\naddition, they may ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how\nresidents feel about community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be\nuseful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities,\nand obtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate any 8 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual site visits and information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate\nand timely information about your grant activities. You should fully comply with any requests regarding\nthese evaluations. 8. Reports To assist the COPS Office in the monitoring of your award, your agency will be responsible for submitting quarterly\nprogrammatic progress reports and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form\n425 (SF-425) . Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the federal government be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the\nprogress of our programs and grantees. What you should do: This grant condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with TRGP\ngrants. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report will be required\nto be submitted directly to the COPS Office through the “Account Access” portion of the COPS Office website\nat www.cops.usdoj.gov."

Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using\nStandard Form 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due\nwithin 90 days after the end of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal monies\nspent, unliquidated obligations incurred, and the unobligated balance of federal funds. Agencies with more\nthan one delinquent programmatic or financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays\nin receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to\nimprove compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in section VI, “Reports,” on\npage 53 of this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid suspension or\npossible termination of grant funds or other remedial actions. 9. Grant monitoring activities\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their grant conditions and other applicable statutory regulations . The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing . Both aspects of grant implementation—compliance and programmatic benefits—are part of the monitoring\nprocess coordinated by the U .S . Department of Justice . Grant monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office\ninclude site visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic\nreporting, and audit resolution . As a COPS TRGP grantee, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests\nfor information pertaining to your grant . Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each grant program must\ncontain a monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how grantees are adhering to COPS\nOffice grant requirements. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an\nentity designated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency’s use of federal funds, both programmatically\nand financially. The most common ways are as follows: 9 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual • site visits. The COPS Office conducts grantee site visits to ensure compliance with grant terms and conditions. These visits also provide firsthand observation of the grantee’s community policing\nstrategies. Promising practices identified during site visits are documented and may be shared with\nthe law enforcement community. Technical assistance and follow-up are conducted to address\npotential and actual vulnerabilities. The purpose of site visits is therefore threefold: review community\npolicing activities, ensure grantee compliance, and provide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will be notified in writing in advance of any on-site review of your COPS Office grants."

The COPS Office responds to complaints from citizens, labor associations, media, and other sources. Written complaints or allegations are reviewed by the COPS Office Grant Monitoring\nDivision and may result in a review of your agency’s grants to determine compliance with grant\nconditions. Grantees are responsible for remedying any grant noncompliance issues identified through these or\nother monitoring or auditing activities. Remedies for noncompliance may include, but are not limited\nto: suspending grant funding, repaying misused grant funds, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary\ntermination of remaining grant funds, and bars from receiving future COPS Office grants. To avoid findings\nof noncompliance, grantees are strongly encouraged to contact the COPS Office at any time during the\nlife of a COPS Office grant with questions concerning grant requirements and also to maintain all relevant\ndocumentation that may demonstrate grant compliance.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) does\nnot impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients of federal funds. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization’s legal status,\nthe number of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization has fewer than 50 employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the\nEEOP requirement."

Contracts with other jurisdictions\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, and/or sworn law enforcement officer positions awarded may only be\nused for law enforcement activities or services that exclusively benefit your agency and the population that it serves . The items funded under the TRGP grant cannot be utilized by other agencies unless the items would exclusively\nbenefit the population that your agency serves . Why this condition: The TRGP was created under a Congressional appropriation specifically designated for tribal law\nenforcement agencies to improve public safety in Indian communities. The TRGP-Hiring grant funding is\nintended to benefit the communities within the grantee’s primary law enforcement jurisdiction. Therefore,\nthe grantee must use the TRGP grant funding to benefit its own population exclusively. 12 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual What you should do: Your law enforcement agency should avoid any agreements with other jurisdictions to share officer\npositions or other awarded equipment, technology, or vehicles unless the agreement complies with the\nrequirement that COPS-funded items must exclusively benefit the grantee service population."

For example,\nif your jurisdiction has a tribal police department and a BIA department, items funded under the grant\nmight be able to be used by the BIA department as long as this would result in an exclusive benefit to the\npopulation that you serve. You may not, however, allow officers, equipment, technology, or vehicles funded\nunder the grant to be used by any agency or transferred to any agency that does not exclusively benefit\nthe population that you serve. For example, you may not, during the grant term, loan two of your awarded\ncomputers to a neighboring county’s sheriff’s department. Officers funded under TRGP-Hiring may not provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies\nunless they will directly benefit the grantee’s jurisdiction. For example, your agency may not use an officer\nfunded under TRGP-Hiring to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but\nyour agency may use the officer to provide direct law enforcement services to the population within your\nagency’s own jurisdiction. Before you enter into any agreement with another law enforcement agency, you should contact your COPS\nGrant Program Specialist (GPS) at 800-421-6770 for additional guidance. 14. False statements False statements or claims made in connection with COPS grants may result in fines, imprisonment, or debarment\nfrom participating in federal grants or contracts, and/or any other remedy available by law. Why this condition: This condition advises recipients of the consequences of submitting false claims or statements on\napplications, financial and programmatic reports, or other grant documents. What you should do:\nEnsure that all documentation related to your agency’s receipt and use of grant funding (grant applications,\nprogress reports, Federal Financial Reports, etc.) is true and accurate. 15. Duplicative funding The recipient understands and agrees to notify the COPS Office if it receives, from any other source, funding for the\nsame item or service also funded under this award. Why this condition: This grant was awarded to your agency to address its law enforcement needs that are not funded from\nother sources, including federal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds. Consequently, your agency may not use this\nfunding for items or services for which you already have funding from other sources. What you should do: If your agency receives funding from another source for the same item(s) or services(s) also funded under\nthis award, please contact your COPS GPS at 800-421-6770. If necessary, the COPS Office will work with your\nagency to reprogram funding for items or services that are allowable under this grant program. 16. Additional high-risk grantee requirements The recipient agrees to comply with any additional requirements that may be imposed during the grant\nperformance period if the awarding agency determines that the recipient is a high-risk grantee (28 C.F.R.

What you should do: At the time of grant application, your agency was required to provide its DUNS number and be registered in\nthe SAM database. Your agency should continue to use the same DUNS number provided in your grant application and\nupdate, as needed, the information associated with that DUNS number. If your agency is authorized to make\nsubawards under its award, your agency may make subawards only to entities that have DUNS numbers.

USASpending. gov. Grantees are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and sub-award\ninformation, and the award term provides guidance to report the related information as required by FFATA. What you should do: At the time of grant application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes\nand systems in place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting\nrequirements should it receive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required\nto report award information on any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to\nreport information on the names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives\nof the recipient and first-tier subrecipients.

Retention At the time of grant application, your agency committed to retaining all sworn officer positions awarded under the\nTRGP Hiring grant with state and/or local funds for a minimum of 12 months following the conclusion of 36 months\nof federal funding for each position, over and above the number of locally-funded sworn officer positions that would\nhave existed in the absence of the grant. Your agency cannot satisfy the retention requirement by using TRGP funded\npositions to fill locally-funded vacancies resulting from attrition. Why this condition: The retention requirement ensures that the increased officer staffing level under the TRGP-Hiring grant\ncontinues with state or local funds for a minimum of 12 months after federal funding ends. What you should do: At the time of grant application, your agency was required to affirm that it planned to retain all sworn officer\npositions awarded under the TRGP-Hiring grant and identify the planned source(s) of retention funding. Your\nagency committed to retaining each awarded position for at least 12 months following the conclusion of 36\nmonths of federal funding for that position. The retention period begins for an awarded officer position once\nthat position has completed the 36-month implementation period. If an agency is awarded several officer\npositions, the retention period for each individual officer position begins upon completion of 36 months of\nfunding for that position (not based on the cumulative grant award end date). The retained TRGP funded position(s) must be added to your agency’s law enforcement budget with state\nor local funds at the conclusion of grant funding, over and above the number of locally-funded sworn officer\npositions that would have existed in the absence of the grant. Absorbing TRGP-funded positions through\nattrition (rather than adding the extra positions to your budget with additional funding) does not meet the\nretention requirement. 18 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Your agency should maintain documentation demonstrating when the 36-month grant funding period\nexpires for each awarded position and that each retained position is above and beyond the number of\nofficer positions that your agency would otherwise have funded with state or local funds. We understand\nthat your agency’s identified source(s) of retention funding may change during the life of the grant, so\nyour agency should maintain documentation of any changes in the event of an audit, monitoring, or other\nevaluation of your grant compliance. Please note that your agency is required to retain the officer position(s) awarded under the TRGP-Hiring\ngrant and not the specific officer(s) hired to fill the grant position(s). If a position funded by the TRGPHiring grant becomes vacant during the retention period, your agency is required to take active and timely\nsteps consistent with your agency’s hiring policies and procedures to fill the position with a new officer to\ncomplete the remainder of the 12-month retention period."

Your agency should maintain documentation\ndemonstrating that you did not delay filling the position and that the steps your agency took to fill the\nposition were consistent with your hiring policies and procedures. At the conclusion of federal funding, agencies that fail to retain the sworn officer positions awarded under\nthe TRGP-Hiring grant may be ineligible to receive future COPS Office grants for a period of three years. If\nyour agency is unable to retain any of the awarded officer positions, you should contact your COPS GPS for\nfurther review. 20. Employment eligibility The grantee agrees to complete and keep on file, as appropriate, a Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services\nEmployment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9) . This form is to be used by recipients of federal funds to verify that\npersons are eligible to work in the United States . Why this condition:\nUnder federal immigration law, all employers are required to take certain steps to ensure that persons that\nare hired are legally permitted to work in the United States. The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration\nServices Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9) outlines the types of documents that an employer\nshould review to confirm that a new hire is eligible for employment. What you should do: You do not need to submit any documentation to the COPS Office to satisfy this condition. Rather, you\nshould complete and maintain the I-9 forms for all new employees under the guidelines set forth by the\nBureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. The I-9 form can be found at www.uscis.gov/files/form/i-9.\npdf. For further information about this requirement, you may contact the Bureau’s Office of Business Liaison\nat 800-357-2099 or the National Customer Service Center at 800-375-5283. 21. Debarment and suspension The recipient agrees not to award Federal funds under this program to any party which is debarred or suspended\nfrom participation in Federal assistance programs . Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, recipients are required to ensure that federal funds are not given to parties\nthat are debarred or suspended from participation in federal assistance programs. This is to protect\nthe public interest and to ensure proper management and integrity in federal activities by conducting\nbusiness only with responsible parties. For details regarding the debarment and suspension requirements,\nplease see 2 CFR part 180 (Government-wide Debarment and Suspension), and 2 CFR part 2867\n(DOJ-specific requirements.) 19 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual What you should do: If under a COPS award you enter into a contract for goods or services that is for $25,000 or more or any\nsubaward, you must verify that the vendor or subawardee and their respective principals (e.g., owners,\ntop managers) with whom you intend to do business are not excluded or disqualified from participation\nin federal assistance programs."

Your agency\nis required to keep Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed as part of its grant application. Please read these documents carefully, because signatures on these documents are treated as a material\nrepresentation of fact upon which reliance will be placed when the U.S. Department of Justice determines\nwhether to award the covered grant. Additional copies of the Assurances and Certifications forms are\ncontained in appendix B of this manual on page 60. If you have any questions about the Assurances and\nCertifications, please contact your COPS GPS at 800-421-6770. 3. Allowable costs The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs to meet the most serious needs of law\nenforcement in tribal communities . The allowable costs for which your agency’s grant has been approved are\nlimited to those listed on the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which are included in your agency’s award\npackage . The FCM specifies the exact items that your agency is allowed to fund with your TRGP grant, and specifies\nthe overall amount approved for each budget request category . Your agency may not use TRGP grant funds for\nany costs that are not identified as allowable in the FCM. Why this condition:\nTRGP-Equipment/Training may only be used for the purchase of equipment, technology, training, uniforms,\nand other items approved by the COPS Office as reflected in the FCM. The COPS TRGP funds the purchase\nof items that have a link to the implementation or enhancement of community policing initiatives in your\nagency. To be eligible for payment under this grant, the purchase of approved items must be made after the grant\naward start date and comply with the guidelines described in section III, “Accessing Grant Funds,” on page 45\nof this manual. Section IV, “Financial Record Maintenance,” on page 48, outlines the types of records you must\nkeep to document that you followed this grant condition. Purchases must also reflect the costs that were\napproved as shown in the FCM. What you should do: All grantees should keep and maintain the most recent, approved version of 2014 TRGP application, which\nwill contain the approved costs for this grant. Refer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable costs. As long as funds are spent during the grant period on the approved salaries or benefits (as applicable),\nequipment, technology, training, or other costs that were documented in your application’s budget\nsummary and were approved through the issuance of the FCM, this grant condition will be satisfied. A. Allowable costs: Background investigations\nBased on the FCM, grantees may have been awarded funding for background investigations for newly\nhired officer positions if other funding (state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)) was not budgeted\nfor the same background investigations. Background investigations must be completed before\nexpenses incurred in connection with such investigations can be reimbursed."

Funded background\ninvestigations may not be initiated prior to the official award start date of the grant period. B. Allowable costs: Training\nBased on the FCM, grantees may have been awarded funding for otherwise unfunded expenses\nassociated with sending recruits to a state academy that will train and certify tribal police officers,\nto the BIA Indian Police Academy in Artesia, New Mexico, or to basic training from an established\nacademy that trains Indian police officers such as the Navajo Nation’s Academy. Basic law\nenforcement training is encouraged for existing police officers who have not received it, depending\non the needs of your department and the availability of funding. Grant funding may only be used\nfor one cycle of basic training per officer. The grantee agency will be responsible for any additional 22 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual costs associated with an officer not completing basic training on the first attempt. TRGP funds may also pay for community policing and problem-solving training; specialized law\nenforcement training in such topics as counterterrorism, family violence, and crime prevention and\ndetection; and training related to Indian Country jurisdictional issues. Only requests for training by\nrecognized training providers such as the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, the FBI, the BIA\nIndian Police Academy, a state police academy, COPS Regional Community Policing Institutes, or a\ntribal community college will be considered. In addition, funding may be used to attend training\nconferences such as the National Native American Law Enforcement Association’s annual training\nconference or any COPS-sponsored conference. Funding for community policing or other law enforcement training will cover only travel,\nlodging, and per diem expenses for each representative to and from the training site (if training\nis conducted more than 50 miles from your agency headquarters). State academy training costs\ninclude training instruction fees, academy tuition, course fees, textbooks, manuals, supplies, and\ntravel in connection with the training (transportation, lodging, per diem, etc.) if the training is\nlocated more than 50 miles from the job site. If your state academy does not charge for the training,\nyour department will be reimbursed only for travel in connection with the training. Departments\nthat send officers to the BIA Indian Police Academy will be reimbursed for travel costs only, as there\nis no cost for tuition at the BIA Indian Police Academy for tribal officers. TRGP-E/T funds may pay for computer training for systems, hardware, or software that grantees\nalready own but may not be utilizing to the fullest extent due to of a lack of training. Applicants\nmust demonstrate that the training enhances law enforcement activities, particularly in support of\ncommunity policing. TRGP-E/T funding may be used only for training costs not already funded in\nthe applicant’s budget with state, local, or BIA funds. In addition, TRGP-E/T funding may be used for off-site training required to increase tribal capacity\nto operate a crime information gathering system compatible with the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting\nSystem.

In the absence of an acceptable and available institutional travel\npolicy, allowable per diem travel costs for lodging, meals, and incidentals will be reimbursed based\non the established GSA per diem rates for the relevant geographic area. These rates can be found\nat www.gsa.gov. Allowable airfare travel costs will be reimbursed based upon the lowest discount\ncommercial airfare; the federal government contract airfare, if authorized and available; or standard\ncoach airfare. For grantees subject to 48 C.F.R. Part 31.000, et seq.

Allowable expenses for grant-related lodging, meals, and\nincidental expenses that were included in the application have been approved by the COPS Office\nas part of the TRGP-E/T award and final budget. Your agency should keep timely and accurate\nrecords of all travel expenses. If at any time these costs change, you should immediately contact\nyour COPS GPS to obtain a grant modification. G. Allowable costs: Supplies All supplies must be solely used for the project identified in your project proposal. Reimbursements\nfor office supplies that are consumed by routine administrative purposes instead of project-related\nactivities are prohibited. Items must meet the guidelines described in 28 C.F.R. Part 66.33 or 28 C.F.R.\nPart 70.35, as applicable. H. Allowable costs: Contracts/consultants\nCompensation for individual consultant services procured under a COPS Office grant must be\nreasonable and allocable in accordance with OMB cost principles and consistent with that paid for\nsimilar services in the marketplace. Unless otherwise approved by the COPS Office, consultant rates\nwill be based on the salary a consultant receives from his or her primary employer, as applicable,\nup to $550 per day. For consultant or contractor rates which exceed $550 per day, the COPS Office\nrequires written justification if the consultants or contractors are hired through a non-competitive\nbidding process and grantees must receive COPS Office approval of those rates before drawing\ndown grant funds. Determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis. I. Allowable costs: Other costs The purchases of project-related expenditures that do not conform to any other category\ndescriptions specified above were included in this section of your FCM. In addition, items that have\na direct correlation to the overall success of a grantee’s project objectives and are necessary for the 24 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual project to reach full implementation are considered on a case-by-case basis by the COPS Office. Requests may be made only for items or positions that are not otherwise budgeted with state,\nlocal, or BIA funds, and would not be funded in the absence of the TRGP grant. Allowable costs: Indirect costs Indirect costs are costs that are incurred for common or joint purposes and are not readily assignable to\na particular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance of the project. Examples of indirect costs include those incurred for facility operation and maintenance, depreciation,\nand administrative salaries. Indirect costs must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) costs principles for your entity, 2 C.F.R. Part 225, Appendix E (state, local,\nand Indian tribal governments); 2 C.F.R. Part 230, Appendix A (non-profit organizations); or 2 C.F.R. Part 220,\nAppendix A (educational institutions)."

Part 225, Appendix E (state, local,\nand Indian tribal governments); 2 C.F.R. Part 230, Appendix A (non-profit organizations); or 2 C.F.R. Part 220,\nAppendix A (educational institutions). Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses that are approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency\ncarefully track and update its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office grant award period. The grantee understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of\napplication, it will be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a\ncurrent indirect cost rate agreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the\naward prohibiting the obligation, expenditure, or drawdown of funds reimbursement for indirect costs until\nan indirect cost rate has been approved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS Office. If your agency’s approved indirect cost rate expires during the grant award period, a current approved rate\nmust be submitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down grant funding for indirect costs. Your agency must advise the COPS Office in writing of any changes to your approved indirect cost rate\nduring the grant award period and must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect any\nrate change. In addition, before the COPS Office officially closes out your agency’s grant award, your agency must\nreconcile any changes between your approved final indirect cost rate and approved provisional indirect cost\nrate and, if necessary, repay the COPS Office for any indirect cost rate overpayment. If your agency draws\ndown excess COPS Office grant funding for indirect costs, please return the overpayment to the COPS Office\nand submit a revised Federal Financial Report (SF-425). See the COPS Office website for a fact sheet on indirect costs, www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=2489. 4.

Supplementing, not supplanting\nState, local, and tribal governments must use TRGP grant funds to supplement, and not supplant, state, local, or BIA\nfunds that are already committed or otherwise would have been committed for grant purposes (hiring, training,\npurchases, and/or activities) during the grant period . In other words, grantees may not use COPS funds to supplant\n(replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to the COPS-funded item(s) in the absence of the\nCOPS grant . 25 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory non-supplanting requirement mandates that grant funds may not be used to\nreplace state or local funds (or, for tribal grantees, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be\nmade available for the grant purposes. What you should do:\nTRGP-E/T grantees may not use grant funds to pay for any item or cost funded under the grant (equipment,\npersonnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA funds or\ncommitted to the grantee’s budget. In addition, grantees may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within the law enforcement\nbudget to another as a result of receiving TRGP grant funds. For example, grantees who have budgeted\nfunds to pay for new computer equipment may not reallocate those funds to pay for any other law\nenforcement cost as a result of receiving TRGP-E/T grant funds for the same computer equipment. TRGP Equipment and Training – To meet this grant condition, you must ensure the following: • Equipment and technology must be purchased on or after the award start date (unless an exception is authorized in writing by the COPS Office) and must be in addition to purchases that the grantee has\nobligated funding in the current budget to make. Funds currently allocated to purchase equipment\nor technology may not be reallocated to other purposes or reimbursed upon the award of a TRGP-E/T\ngrant. For example, grantees who have budgeted local funds to pay for a new computer system may\nnot reallocate those funds to pay for any other law enforcement cost as a result of receiving TRGP-E/T\nfunds for the same computer system. • Any training covered by TRGP-E/T funds is in addition to the number of hours of training already\nprovided by your agency. Funds currently allocated for training may not be reallocated to other\npurposes. Note: This grant condition applies to all state or locally-funded agencies working in partnership with your\nagency under this grant. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any partner agencies use COPS Office\nfunds only to supplement, not supplant, their state, local, or BIA funding as described in this condition. 6. Extensions\nYour agency may request an extension of the grant award period to receive additional time to implement your grant\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Grants may be extended a maximum of 36 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis."

      "content": "Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Grants may be extended a maximum of 36 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis. Only those grantees that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted nocost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays, or other\ncircumstances that interrupt the 36-month grant funding period. An extension allows your agency to compensate\nfor such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding. Extension requests must be\nreceived prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the grant award period require prior written approval from\nthe COPS Office. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal\nfunding for costs incurred beyond the official grant award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office\nseeks to accommodate reasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the\nCOPS Office grant. 26 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the grant award period to determine\nwhether a no-cost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the grant\nend date. Requests to extend the grant award period must be received by the COPS Office before the official\ngrant award end date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will be considered only when\nthe grantee provides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance\nin which an unforeseen natural disaster prevented a grantee from requesting an extension. Failure to submit\na request for a no-cost time extension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any\nremaining grant funds. Automatic extensions will be granted for grantee requests of six months or less. All extension requests\nbeyond six months will require review and approval by the COPS Office. Individual or cumulative requests\ngreater than one-half of the grant’s original term (i.e., 18 months) will require additional justification and\nmust include a detailed timeline. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the grant due to salary and fringe benefits costs that\nwere lower than anticipated, your agency may not extend the 36-month funding period for the purpose of\nexpending those excess funds. Grantees are entitled to a maximum of 36 months of federal funding based\non the approved salary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining\ngrant funds during the closeout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time\nextension, please contact your COPS Grant Program Specialist. 7. Modifications\nOccasionally, a change in an agency’s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its TRGP award. Grant modifications under TRGP are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All modification requests involving the\npurchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their implementation."

All modification requests involving the\npurchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their implementation. In\naddition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that results in an increase\nof federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram grant funds. Acceptable examples of such\naward modifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost savings from approved items\nor purchasing a different type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may\nexpend grant funds only as approved in the FCM. Any requests to change or alter grant awards require\nwritten approval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Without prior written approval, you\nmust continue to implement your grant as it was originally awarded and accepted by your agency. Please be\nadvised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs (e.g., construction) will not be approved. What you should do: For all modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the “Account Access” link\nin the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office, providing the proposed\nchanges, details of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific grant modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified grant award\nmay begin following written approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for\nactive grants will often be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes. If applicable, your agency is required to sign and submit the modified award document via the Account\nAccess link to officially accept the grant modification. 27 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual 8. Evaluations\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS TRGP. The grantee agrees to\ncooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the Attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nAct. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office\nmay assess the way in which your agency implements its grant. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or\nevaluators may study the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect\ninformation about the programs’ effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In\naddition, they may ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how\nresidents feel about community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be\nuseful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information."

You will be asked to facilitate\nany site visits and information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and\ntimely information about your grant activities. You should fully comply with any requests regarding these\nevaluations. 9. Reports To assist the COPS Office in the monitoring of your award, your agency will be responsible for submitting quarterly\nprogrammatic progress reports and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the federal government be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the\nprogress of our programs and grantees. What you should do: This grant condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with TRGP\ngrants. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report will be required\nto be submitted directly to the COPS Office through the “Account Access” portion of the COPS Office website\nat www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using\nStandard Form 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due\nwithin 90 days after the end of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal monies\nspent, unliquidated obligations incurred, and the unobligated balance of federal funds. Agencies with more\nthan one delinquent programmatic or financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays\nin receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to\nimprove compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in section VI, “Reports,” on\npage 53 of this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid suspension or\npossible termination of grant funds or other remedial actions. 28 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual 10. Grant monitoring activities\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their grant conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of grant implementation—compliance and programmatic benefits—are part of the monitoring\nprocess coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Grant monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office\ninclude site visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic\nreporting, and audit resolution. As a COPS TRGP grantee, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests\nfor information pertaining to your grant. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing"

What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an\nentity designated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency’s use of federal funds, both programmatically\nand financially. The most common ways are as follows: • site visits. The COPS Office conducts grantee site visits to ensure compliance with grant terms and conditions. These visits also provide firsthand observation of the grantee’s community policing\nstrategies. Promising practices identified during site visits are documented and may be shared with\nthe law enforcement community. Technical assistance and follow-up are conducted to address\npotential and actual vulnerabilities. The purpose of site visits is therefore threefold: review community\npolicing activities, ensure grantee compliance, and provide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will be notified in writing in advance of any on-site review of your COPS Office grants. This review is generally performed over a period of one or more days and also provides an opportunity\nfor agency representatives to seek assistance on any grant implementation issues. Your agency will be\nnotified in writing of the results and any action required to remedy identified grant violations. • Office-Based Grant Reviews (OBGR). In lieu of a site visit, certain grants are selected for a review conducted at the COPS Office. If selected, your agency will be contacted at the start of this review and\nour staff will work with your agency to correct any grant problems or deficiencies through telephone,\ne-mail, fax, or written correspondence with your agency. • complaints. The COPS Office responds to complaints from citizens, labor associations, media, and other sources. Written complaints or allegations are reviewed by the COPS Office Grant\nMonitoring Division and may result in a review of your agency’s grants to determine compliance\nwith grant conditions. Grantees are responsible for remedying any grant noncompliance issues identified through these or\nother monitoring or auditing activities. Remedies for noncompliance may include, but are not limited\nto: suspending grant funding, repaying misused grant funds, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary\ntermination of remaining grant funds, and bars from receiving future COPS Office grants. To avoid findings\nof noncompliance, grantees are strongly encouraged to contact the COPS Office at any time during the\nlife of a COPS Office grant with questions concerning grant requirements and also to maintain all relevant\ndocumentation that may demonstrate grant compliance.

Federal civil rights As a condition of receipt of federal financial assistance, you acknowledge and agree that you will not (and will\nrequire any sub-grantees, contractors, successors, transferees, and assignees not to), on the grounds of race, color,\nreligion, national origin (which includes providing limited English proficient persons meaningful access to your\nprograms), sex, disability, or age, unlawfully exclude any person from participation in, deny the benefits of or\nemployment to any person, or subject any person to discrimination in connection with any programs or activities\nfunded in whole or in part with federal funds. These civil rights requirements are found in the non-discrimination\nprovisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. § 2000d); the Omnibus Crime Control and\nSafe Streets Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. § 3789d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended\n(29 U.S.C. § 794); the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. §6101, et seq.); Title IX of the Education Amendments\nof 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.); and the corresponding DOJ regulations implementing those statutes\nat 28 C.F.R. Part 42 (subparts C, D, E, G, and I). You also agree to comply with Executive Order 13279 Equal Treatment\nfor Faith-Based Organizations and its implementing regulations at 28 C.F.R. Part 38, which requires equal\ntreatment of religious organizations in the funding process and non-discrimination of beneficiaries by Faith-Based\nOrganizations on the basis of belief or non-belief. Why this condition: In establishing financial assistance programs, Congress linked the receipt of federal funding to compliance\nwith federal civil rights laws. As a result, grantees are required to comply with the civil rights requirements\nfound in the non-discrimination provisions referenced above. A hold may be placed on your award if it is\ndeemed that your agency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an\nongoing federal civil rights investigation. If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate\nor draw down federal funds under your agency’s COPS Office grant award until you comply with federal civil\nrights laws or cooperate with any ongoing federal civil rights investigation. What you should do: As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the\napplicable federal civil rights laws and to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective\nenforcement of such laws and to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes\nproviding access to records, accounts, documents, information, facilities, and staff. 12. Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R.

Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that established the COPS Office,\nthat “the full and equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in\nthe criminal justice system is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act’s program to reduce crime and\ndelinquency in the United States” 28 C.F.R. § 42.301. The Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) does\nnot impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients of federal funds. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization’s legal status,\nthe number of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization has fewer than 50 employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the 30 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual EEOP requirement. To claim the exemption, your organization must complete and submit section A of the\nCertification Form to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice,\n810 7th Street NW, Washington, DC 20531. The Certification Form can be found at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/\nabout/ocr/pdfs/cert.pdf. If your organization is a governmental agency or private business and has received an award between\n$25,000 and $500,000 and has 50 or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but\nexcluding political appointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report (formerly called an EEOP Short\nForm), but it does not need to submit it to the OCR for review. Instead, your organization must maintain\nthe Utilization Report on file and make it available to the OCR for review on request. In addition, your\norganization must complete and submit section B of the Certification Form to the Office for Civil Rights\n(OCR), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, 810 7th Street NW, Washington, DC 20531. The\nCertification Form can be found at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/pdfs/cert.pdf.

Community policing\nCommunity policing activities to be initiated or enhanced by your agency were identified and described in your\ngrant application . All equipment, technology, training, and/or sworn officer positions awarded under the TRGP\ngrant must be linked to the implementation or enhancement of community policing . Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office defines community policing as a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that\nsupport the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the\nimmediate conditions giving rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. TRGP grants must be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities. All newly hired, additional,\nor rehired officers (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) funded under TRGP-Hiring must\nengage in community policing activities. While the COPS Office recognizes that your COPS-funded officer(s)\n(or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) will participate in some or all aspects of your identified\ncommunity policing plan and advance your agency’s community policing activities over the life of the grant,\nwe also encourage your agency to move toward an organization-wide philosophy and commitment to\ncommunity policing. COPS Office grants are designed to increase community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This is achieved through problem-solving tactics and community policing partnerships. It enhances police\nprofessionalism by providing officers with the skills and motivation to act in innovative ways to solve\ncommunity crime-related problems. Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure that it is\ninitiating or enhancing community policing in accordance with your proposed plan, and that the officers 31 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual hired (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance\nyour agency’s community policing activities over the life of the grant. The COPS Office may also use this\ninformation to understand the needs of the field, and potentially provide for training, technical assistance,\nproblem solving, and community policing implementation tools. What you should do:\nCommunity policing activities to be implemented or enhanced by your agency were identified in your grant\napplication. Your community policing needs may change during the life of your grant, and minor changes to\nthis plan may be made without prior approval of the COPS Office. If your agency’s community policing plan\nchanges significantly, however, you must submit those changes in writing to the COPS Office for approval. Changes are significant if they deviate from the range of possible community policing activities identified\nand approved in the original community policing plan submitted with your application."

Changes are significant if they deviate from the range of possible community policing activities identified\nand approved in the original community policing plan submitted with your application. 14. Contracts with other jurisdictions\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, and/or sworn law enforcement officer positions awarded may only be\nused for law enforcement activities or services that exclusively benefit your agency and the population that it serves . The items funded under the TRGP grant cannot be utilized by other agencies unless the items would exclusively\nbenefit the population that your agency serves . Why this condition: The TRGP was created under a Congressional appropriation specifically designated for tribal law\nenforcement agencies to improve public safety in Indian communities. The TRGP-E/T grant funding is\nintended to benefit the communities within the grantee’s primary law enforcement jurisdiction. Therefore,\nthe grantee must use the TRGP grant funding to benefit its own population exclusively. What you should do: Your law enforcement agency should avoid any agreements with other jurisdictions to share officer\npositions or other awarded equipment, technology, or vehicles, unless the agreement complies with the\nrequirement that COPS-funded items must exclusively benefit the grantee service population. For example,\nif your jurisdiction has both a tribal police department and a BIA department, items funded under the grant\nmight be able to be used by the BIA department as long as this would result in an exclusive benefit to the\npopulation that you serve. You may not, however, allow officers, equipment, technology, or vehicles funded\nunder the grant to be utilized by any agency or transferred to any agency that does not exclusively benefit\nthe population that you serve. For example, you may not, during the grant term, loan two of your awarded\ncomputers to a neighboring county’s sheriff’s department. Before you enter into any agreement with another law enforcement agency, you should contact your COPS\nGrant Program Specialist (GPS) at 800-421-6770 for additional guidance. 15. False statements False statements or claims made in connection with COPS grants may result in fines, imprisonment, or debarment\nfrom participating in federal grants or contracts, and/or any other remedy available by law . Why this condition: This condition advises recipients of the consequences of submitting false claims or statements on\napplications, financial and programmatic reports, or other grant documents. What you should do:\nEnsure that all documentation related to your agency’s receipt and use of grant funding (grant applications,\nprogress reports, Federal Financial Reports, etc.) is true and accurate. 32 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual 16. Duplicative funding The recipient understands and agrees to notify the COPS Office if it receives, from any other source, funding for the\nsame item or service also funded under this award. Why this condition: This grant was awarded to your agency to address its law enforcement needs that are not funded with other\nfunds, including federal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds."

What you should do: If your agency receives funding from another source for the same item(s) or services(s) also funded under\nthis award, please contact your COPS GPS at 800-421-6770. If necessary, the COPS Office will work with your\nagency to reprogram funding for items or services that are allowable under this grant program. 17. Additional high-risk grantee requirements The recipient agrees to comply with any additional requirements that may be imposed during the grant\nperformance period if the awarding agency determines that the recipient is a high-risk grantee (28 C.F.R. Parts 66\nand 70). Why this condition:\nThe Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local\nGovernments, 28 C.F.R. Part 66.12, and for Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit\nOrganizations, 28 C.F.R. Part 70.14, provide that a grantee or applicant may be considered high risk if the\nU.S. Department of Justice determines that there is unsatisfactory performance, financial or administrative\ninstability, nonconformity with award terms and conditions, or other lack of responsibility. In such cases,\nthe U.S. Department of Justice may impose special conditions or restrictions that may include requiring the\nproduction of documentation, financial grant administration training, onsite monitoring, prior approval for\nexpenditure of funds, quarterly progress reports, separate bank accounts, or other requirements. What you should do: In order to obtain a COPS Office grant, recipients must agree to comply with any additional requirements\nthat may be imposed during the grant performance period if the awarding agency determines that the\nrecipient is a high-risk grantee. 18. System for Award Management and Universal Identifier requirements The Office of Management and Budget requires federal agencies to include the following standard award\nterm in all grants and cooperative agreements made on or after October 1, 2010:\nA. Requirement for System for Award Management (SAM) Unless you are exempted from this requirement under 2 C.F.R.

The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the\nwebsite at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward\ninformation and any executive compensation data required by FFATA. The subaward information entered\nin FSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov associated with your agency’s award, furthering\nfederal spending transparency."

Criminal intelligence systems\nGrantees using TRGP funds to operate an inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with\noperating principles of 28 C .F .R . Part 23 . The grantee acknowledges that it has completed, signed, and submitted\nwith its grant award the relevant Special Condition certifying its compliance with 28 C .F .R . Part 23 . Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found at\n28 C.F.R. Part 23. An interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system which\nreceives, stores, analyzes, and exchanges or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal\nactivities (examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property 37 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling, bribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other\nlaw enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23 contains operating principles for these interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence systems that protect individual privacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use TRGP grant funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated\nforms of technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ndoes not apply to this grant. What you should do:\nAll COPS Office grant recipients are required to agree to the Criminal Intelligence Systems/28 C.F.R. Part 23\nCompliance Special Condition as part of their award package so the COPS Office can track which agencies\nintend to use their grant funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency\nintends to use grant funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should indicate\nthis on the Criminal Intelligence Systems 28 C.F.R. Part 23 Compliance form that was included with your\ngrant award package and certify and submit this form along with your signed grant award document as\nyour agency’s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Your agency\nmust now comply with 28 C.F.R. Part 23 in operating the interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system\nfunded through your COPS Office grant. 21. Sole source justification\nTRGP-Equipment/Training grantees who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group\nof items) or service in excess of $100,000, and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement\nprocess must provide a written sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating,\nexpending, or drawing down grant funds for that item . Why this condition: In general, grant recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in some instances, grantees may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do:"

However, in some instances, grantees may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: If you have received an award for an item (or group of items) or service in excess of $100,000 and have\nalready determined that the award of a contract through a competitive process is infeasible, you must\nprovide a written justification that explains why it is necessary to contract non-competitively. The initial determination that competition is not feasible can be made if one of the following\ncircumstances exists: • The item (or group of items) or service is available only from a single source. • Public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive\nsolicitation. • Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. The COPS Office will review your request and the supporting information that you provide and will make a\ndetermination as to whether or not an exception can be granted to the general rule regarding competition.

PROCUREMENT PROCESS (FOR TRGP-EQUIPMENT/TRAINING GRANTS ONLY) In general, grant recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition when\nfeasible. For the purchase of equipment, technology, or services under a COPS Office grant award, grant\nrecipients must follow their own policies and procedures on procurement as long as those requirements\nconform to the federal procurement requirements set forth in 28 C.F.R. § 66.36 and 28 C.F.R. § 70 (as applicable). As described in grant condition #21 on page 38, grantees are required to submit a sole source justification\n(SSJ) request if competitive bidding will not be possible and the threshold of $100,000 for goods or services\nto be procured through a sole source is met. The COPS Office will review your request and supporting\ninformation to determine whether an exception can be granted to the general rule of open competition. Written approval from the COPS Office for the use of a sole source must be received prior to purchasing\nitems or services, obligating funding for a contract, or entering into a contract with grant funds. All grantees\nare expected to review and abide by 28 C.F.R. Part 66.36 Procurement (or 28 C.F.R. Part 70.40 - 70.48 for\ninstitutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations) in determining if an SSJ\nmust be completed. Please contact your COPS Grant Program Specialist (GPS) at 800-421-6770 for further\nassistance with this federal regulation. A sole source justification request should be submitted if a grant recipient determines that the award of a\ncontract through a competitive process is infeasible and if one or more of the following circumstances apply: • The item (or group of items) or service is available only from one source. • The public exigency or emergency for the item/service will not permit a delay resulting from\ncompetitive solicitation. • Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. What documentation must be submitted to the COPS Office for sole\nsource review? Requests for sole source procurements of equipment, technology, or services in excess of $100,000 must be\nsubmitted to the COPS Office in writing, confirming that the award of the contract through full and open\ncompetition is infeasible.

For assistance with financial management and grant administration, please contact the\nCOPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one method of payment available for accessing federal grant funds—the Grant Payment\nRequest System (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables grantees to use a secure Internet\nconnection to request funds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury. A grantee will be able to review previous requests made since July 2009. For more information on the GPRS, please go to www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view\nthe user guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a GPRS account? If you are a new grantee to the COPS Office, your law enforcement executive or government executive\nshould receive notification about GPRS shortly after the COPS Office receives your original signed award\ndocument. This notification will contain all of the information that your agency needs to set up the GPRS\npayment method. If your law enforcement executive or government executive does not perform drawdown\nrequests for your agency, your grant administrator will need to go online to https://grants.ojp.usdoj. gov/gprs/welcome to log in and register to become a drawdown specialist. You will receive, via e-mail, a\ntemporary password and information on how to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process\nmay involve outreach to your law enforcement executive and/or government executive or other financial\npoints of contact to validate information provided by the drawdown specialist. If you are already registered for a COPS grant in GPRS, and would like to add a newly awarded COPS grant\nto the existing COPS grant username, please contact the COPS GPRS Registration Team via e-mail at\nCOPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information: • User name (for COPS grants)\n• First and Last name\n• Vendor number\n• Grant number(s) to be added\nHow do we fill out the payment enrollment forms?

If you have any questions, or wish to verify your\nACH enrollment form information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you are\nrequired to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFRs) using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able\nto make drawdowns from your grant account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not\non file with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Grantees are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports\nvia the Internet at www.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see Section VI of this\nmanual, titled “Reports,” on page 53. Filing the FFR (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar quarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of minimum cash on hand applies to COPS Office grants. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment\nto ensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal grant funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as\nnoted above. The federal government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the grantee • is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\n• maintains excess cash on hand;\n• does not adhere to the terms and conditions of the grant;\n• fails to submit reliable or timely reports."

Also, please note that a date range can only be used once. 46 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Can we earn interest on our grant funds? Your agency should minimize the time between your drawdown of grant funds and your payment of grant\ncosts to avoid earning excess interest on your grant funds. You must account for interest earned on advances\nof federal funds as follows: • Local units of government may keep interest earned on all advances of federal funds up to $100 per federal fiscal year in the aggregate. Interest earned in excess of $100 must be remitted promptly, but at\nleast quarterly, to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management Systems,\nP.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. • Except as provided in 28 C.F.R. Part 70.22(l), nonprofit organizations may keep interest earned on all advances of federal funds up to $250 per federal fiscal year in the aggregate. Interest earned in excess\nof $250 must be remitted annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Payment\nManagement Systems, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. • Please notify your COPS Office Staff Accountant in the COPS Office Financial Division when any interest\nthat is earned is remitted to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management\nSystems, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. • State governments, including any agency or instrumentality of a state, should follow the provisions of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6501 et. seq.) pertaining to the disposition of interest\nearned on federal funds. Matching funds\nUnder the 2014 COPS TRGP Programs, no local match is required. The COPS Office is funding 100 percent\nof the allowable items approved in your FCM. (Any salary and benefit costs higher than entry-level must be\npaid by your agency with local funds.) Please note: If the total cost exceeds the approved budget, then the\naddition expenditures are encouraged to be reported on the SF-425 as recipient share of expenditures. 47 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual IV.

Accounting systems and records Under the COPS TRGP grant, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems and\nfinancial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include both\nfederal funds and any local funds contributed to this project. What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately\naccount for the funds awarded. Your accounting system should • present and itemize actual expenditures of funded items;\n• demonstrate that funds are spent in compliance with your grant conditions;\n• be able to provide the necessary information for periodic financial review and audit. What records must be kept? Your agency’s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and\ncomplete disclosure of the financial activity under your grant. Your accounting records should contain\ninformation showing expenditures under the grant and must be supported by items such as cancelled\nchecks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard grant funds and make sure that they are used for authorized\npurposes only. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must documents be kept? All financial records, including cancelled checks, purchase orders, and similar documents associated with\nyour grant should be kept for at least three years from the date the COPS Office officially closes the grant. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving these records has been started before\nthe end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These records\nshould be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to maintain\nadequate records to document grant expenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds that\ncannot be supported with appropriate records. Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by grant year or by fiscal year, whichever\nyou find more convenient. What if we have more than one grant? If your agency has more than one COPS Office grant or a grant from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization\nfrom the COPS Office, or, in the case of a grant from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your\naccounting systems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. 48 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the\nComptroller General of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office\nmay access these records for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 49 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual V.

      "content": "49 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual V. FEDERAL AUDIT REQUIREMENTS In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your grant may be subject to an audit by independent\nexaminers. The two primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice\n(DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audits. Requirements and audits What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving\nfederal financial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised June 27, 2003 and again\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003 to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 (OMB A-133), Audits of\nStates, Local Governments and Non-Profit Organizations, provides additional guidelines regarding the\nimplementation of SAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? Each non-federal entity that expends a total amount of federal awards equal to or in excess of $500,000 in\na fiscal year is required to have a Single Audit conducted, except when it elects to have a program-specific\naudit conducted. An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or a vendor. Specifically, “Federal awards\nexpended as a recipient or a sub-recipient would be subject to audit under A-133, Subpart B, Section 210.”\nSAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute\nin effect on January 1, 1987 to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA\naudit is to express opinions on the grantee’s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major\ngrant programs, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address\nspecific compliance issues with respect to COPS Office grant requirements. Failure to have an audit performed may result in sanctions imposed by federal agencies for noncompliance\nwith OMB Circular A-133. These sanctions under A-133, Section 225 could include the following: • Withholding a percentage of federal awards until a required audit is completed satisfactorily\n• Withholding or disallowing overhead costs\n• Suspending your award until the audit is performed\n• Terminating your award\nYour Single Audit Act reports should not be sent to the COPS Office. If the U.S. Department of Justice is your\ncognizant federal agency (see the Glossary of Terms on page 76), they should be sent to the Federal Audit\nClearinghouse at:\nFederal Audit Clearinghouse\nBureau of Census\n1201 East 10th Street\nJeffersonville, IN 47132\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) serves as the liaison between grantees and\nauditors in the conduct of SAA audits. Questions and comments regarding SAA audits may be directed to\nthe COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. 50 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual What is the role of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG)?

      "content": "What is the role of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG)? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The primary objective of OIG audits is to assess compliance with grant conditions. OIG audits are designed to\npromote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of grants by evaluating compliance with\nlaws, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the operations encompassed in the scope of the audit. How are COPS Office grants selected for an OIG audit? The OIG may conduct a COPS Office grant audit in response to a referral that the OIG believes warrants\nfurther evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ agencies on an annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit\nareas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the OIG selects grants based on a number of\nfactors, including the geographical distribution of grants awarded, award amount, population served, and\ntype of grant (both active and expired). As such, the fact that your grant has been selected for an OIG audit is\nnot necessarily indicative of a suspected concern or problem area. The COPS Grant Monitoring Division serves as the liaison between grantees and the OIG’s Audit Division,\nwhich conducts the audit. After the OIG notifies the COPS Office of upcoming audits to be conducted, the\nCOPS Audit Liaison Division will send out a notification letter to the grantee outlining the scope of each\naudit and the anticipated audit timeframe. This notification letter also advises grantees of the supporting\ndocumentation required and information necessary for the OIG during their scheduled field work and\nprovides a COPS Office point of contact to address questions and concerns. If you have any questions\nregarding an OIG audit, please contact the COPS Grant Monitoring Division at 800-421-6770. Questions and\ncomments regarding the administration of your COPS Office grant not specifically related to an audit should\nbe referred to your COPS Grant Program Specialist. Typical audit findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to grants as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems: • unallowable costs. Grantee incurred costs which were not approved in the original budget, were in excess of the approved budget, or were charged to the grant after the expiration date and a grant\nextension was not obtained. • unsupported costs. Specific grant expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by\nadequate documentation, or grant expenditures were in excess of actual grant costs. • lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Grantee failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. • failure to retain. Grantee lacked documentation to support retention planning efforts during the\ngrant period or failed to demonstrate an increase in the baseline of locally-funded sworn officer\npositions at the conclusion of the 36 months of federal funding, over and above what the grantee\nwould have funded in absence of the grant. • supplanting.

After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Audit Liaison Division will continue working as\nthe liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The COPS Office\nwill issue a closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must keep all\ndocumentation related to the audit for a period of three years following the audit’s closure. 52 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual VI. REPORTS As part of the TRGP, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report TRGP funding\nseparately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal grants) to ensure accurate\nfinancial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial\ninternal controls in place to monitor the use of TRGP funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the\ngrant terms and conditions. Good practices in this area include written accounting practices, an accounting\nsystem that tracks all drawdowns and grant expenditures, and the ability to track when each TRGP position\nis filled or vacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit complete reports,\nor submit them in a timely manner, may result in the suspension and possible termination of your agency’s\nCOPS grant funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end\nof the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal monies spent, unliquidated obligations\nincurred, and any unobligated balance of federal funds. How do we file a Federal Financial Report? All COPS grantees are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Grantees\nare strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online.

The online SF-425 requires the same reporting information as the paper\nversion. The use of this online application enables authorized users to view past SF-425s, and allows them to\nfile or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports due? SF-425s for COPS grants must be submitted every quarter and no later than 30 days after the last day of each\nreporting quarter, as detailed below:\nTable 1.

You are required to submit an SF-425 even if you have not spent any money or incurred any costs during a\nreporting period. The due dates for online filing of SF-425s are the same as for the submission of paper copies. 53 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Example: If your award start date is 02-01-13 and the current date is 04-15-13, then your first SF-425 would be due no\nlater than 04-30-13 and would cover the period 02-01-13 (award start date) through 03-31-13 (end of the\nmost recent reporting quarter). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office so that you can successfully\ncomplete a drawdown of funds through GPRS. Grantees who do not submit SF-425s by the due date will be unable to draw down funds. The payment\nsystem contains a function which checks for SF-425 delinquency and will reject a drawdown attempt if the\nSF-425 is not up to date. Subsequent e-mail, fax, or hard copy reminders may be sent to the grantee if the\nSF-425 is delinquent.

Community policing comprises three key components:\n1. Community partnerships 2. Organizational transformation 3. Problem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between the law enforcement agency and the\nindividuals and organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages\ninteractive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems\nthrough collaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in\nprioritizing and addressing public safety problems. Other government agencies\nLaw enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions."

      "content": "The public should play a role in\nprioritizing and addressing public safety problems. Other government agencies\nLaw enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and\nschools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community—volunteers, activists, formal\nand informal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters—are a valuable resource\nfor identifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific\ngoals at town hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the\ncommunity, and team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncommon interests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue\ngroups, advocacy groups, community development corporations, and the faith community. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners\nbecause they often bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own\nsecurity technology and community outreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can\nalso assist in disseminating information about police and business partnerships and initiatives, and crime\nprevention practices. 65 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can\nassist with publicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government\nor community agencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a\nsignificant impact on public perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way departments are organized and managed and\nhow the infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It\nencourages the application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing emphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and\ninfuse it throughout the entire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel,\nand its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management diffuses community policing ideals throughout\nthe agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor\nrelations, decentralized decision making and accountability, strategic planning, policies and procedures,\norganizational evaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem\nsolving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and\ncommunication that take place within agencies to support this orientation."

Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and\ncommunication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement\ncommunity policing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore,\nmust constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing’s vision, values, and mission within their\norganization and support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of\ndoing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must\nbe a part of the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor groups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to\ncommunity policing implementation. Decision-making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision-making. Decentralized decision-making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community\npolicing. When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels\naccountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision-making involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risktaking in problem-solving efforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing\nsufficient authority to coordinate various resources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy\nto establish relationships with the community will help define problems and develop possible solutions. 66 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan\nis to have value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples\nof their efforts supporting the plan. Components such as the organization’s mission and values statement\nshould be simple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure\nthat community policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving\nand partnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of\nprocedures, where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime\nrates), community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include such things as\ngreater community satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality\nof life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation—one that looks at how\nfeedback information is used, not only how outcomes are measured. Transparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the community is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant\ninformation on crime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community.

If the community is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant\ninformation on crime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local patrol officers have\ndecision-making authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term\nassignments, the development of officers who are generalists and using special units appropriately. Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods\nor areas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance customer service and facilitate more contact\nbetween police and citizens, thus establishing a strong relationship and mutual accountability. Beat\nboundaries should correspond to neighborhood boundaries and other government services should\nrecognize these boundaries when coordinating government public-service activities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers have to be able to handle multiple responsibilities and take a\nteam approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the community. Community policing\nencourages its adoption agency-wide, not just in special units, although there may be a need for some\nspecialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly complex problems or managing\ncomplex partnerships. Resources and finances\nAgencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources to support community policing to\nensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained and effective. 67 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Personnel The principles of community policing need to be diffused throughout the entire personnel system of an\nagency including recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from\nsworn officers to civilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be\naligned with the agencies’ community policing values. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment,\nselection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving\nresponsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service, instead of only a spirit\nof adventure. A community policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it is seeking recruits,\nwhom it is recruiting and hiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community\ninvolvement in this process through the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations\nSupervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are\nincorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional procedures should support sound\nproblem-solving activities, proactive policing, community collaboration, and citizen satisfaction with police\nservices. Training\nTraining at all levels—academy, field, and in-service—must support community policing principles and tactics. It also needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to identify\nand correct conditions that could lead to crime, to raise public awareness, and to engage the community\nin finding solutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage\nproblem solving and help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives."

Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage\nproblem solving and help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is\ninstitutionalized in the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information systems (technology) Community policing is information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in helping to provide ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with improving two-way communication with citizens and in\ndeveloping agency accountability systems and performance outcome measures. Communication/access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the\npublic and internally with their own staff. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages\nagencies to develop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports,\nreverse 911 and e-mail alerts, discussion forums, and feedback on interactive applications (surveys, maps),\nthereby creating ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters,\ne-mail and enhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with\nother entities for more efficient operations. Community policing also encourages the use of technology to\ndevelop accountability and performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics\nand a broad array of measures and information. 68 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely\ninformation on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers\nin their patrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem\nanalysis functions by enabling agencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime\nlocations, and quality-of-life concerns, and to further enhance analysis.

Quality and accuracy of data Information is only as good as its source, and therefore it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and\naccuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information\nfrom various sources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked\nto one another and checked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem\nsolving, and performance measurement. Problem solving\nProblem solving is the process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified\nproblems to develop and evaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving\nmust be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to\nthink innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential\nresponses. A major conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured\nand disciplined way is the SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine\nthe scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more\nincidents that are similar in one or more ways and that are of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of\nany of these. The police, with input from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. 69 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses,\nestablish correlation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is\nimportant to find out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?,\nwhen?, where?, how?, why?, and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and\nextent of problems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem."

The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem or reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the\nproblem declined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the\ncurrent effort but also gathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be\nassessed for process, outcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information\ngathered during analysis should be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new\nsolutions can be developed and tested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear,\nmeaning that additional scanning, analysis, or responses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for\nexample, capable guardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders\n(e.g., parents, friends, and probation officers), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park\nemployees, and motel clerks). Rather than focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the\npolice focus on the factors that are within their reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to\nvictims, increasing guardianship, and associating risk with unwanted behavior.

At present,\nan officer may select a garment that corresponds to an appropriate threat level\nand be confident that armor in compliance with NIJ’s standard will defeat the\nstated threat level.” Type I (.22 LR; .38 Special) Type I body armor is light. This is the minimum level of protection every officer should have, and the armor\nshould be routinely worn at all times while on duty. Type I body armor was the armor issued during the NIJ\ndemonstration project in the mid-1970s. Most agencies today, however, because of increasing threats, opt\nfor a higher level of protection."

Most agencies today, however, because of increasing threats, opt\nfor a higher level of protection. This armor protects against .22 long rifle high-velocity lead bullets, with nominal masses of 2.6 g (40 gr),\nimpacting at a velocity of 320 m/s (1,050 ft/s) or less, and against .38 special round-nose lead bullets, with\nnominal masses of 10.2 g (158 gr), impacting at a velocity of 259 m/s (850 ft/s) or less. It also provides\nprotection against most other .25 and .32 caliber handgun rounds. Type II-A (lower velocity .357 Magnum; 9mm)\nType II-A body armor is well suited for full-time use by police departments, particularly those seeking\nprotection for their officers from lower velocity .357 Magnum and 9mm ammunition. This armor protects against .357 Magnum jacketed soft-point bullets, with nominal masses of 10.2 g (158\ngr), impacting at a velocity of 381 m/s (1,250 ft/s) or less, and against 9mm full-metal jacketed bullets, with\nnominal masses of 8.0 g (124 gr), impacting at a velocity of 332 m/s (1,175 ft/s). It also protects against such\nthreats as .45 auto., .38 special +P, and some other factory loads in caliber .357 Magnum and 9mm as well as\nthe Type I threats. Type II (higher velocity .357 Magnum; 9mm)\nType II body armor is heavier and bulkier than either Types I or II-A. It is worn full-time by officers seeking\nprotection against higher velocity .357 Magnum and 9mm ammunition. This armor protects against .357 Magnum jacketed soft-point bullets, with nominal masses of 10.2 g (158 gr),\nimpacting at a velocity of 425 m/s (1,395 ft/s) or less, and against 9mm full-jacketed bullets, with nominal\nvelocities of 358 m/s (1,175 ft/s). It also protects against most other factory loads in caliber .357 Magnum and\n9mm as well as the Type I and II-A threats. Type III-A (.44 Magnum; submachine gun 9mm) Type III-A body armor provides the highest level of protection currently available from concealable body\narmor and is generally suitable for routine wear in many situations. However, departments located in hot,\nhumid climates may need to evaluate the use of Type III-A armor carefully. This armor protects against .44 Magnum lead semi-wadcutter bullets with gas checks, nominal masses of\n15.55 g (240 gr), impacting at a velocity of 426 m/s (1,400 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against\nmost handgun threats as well as the Type I, II-A, and II threats. 71 COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Grant Owner's Manual Type III (high-powered rifle) Type III body armor is clearly intended only for tactical situations when the threat warrants such protection,\nsuch as barricade confrontations involving sporting rifles. This armor, normally of hard or semi-rigid construction, protects against 7.62 mm full-metal jacketed bullets\n(U.S. military designation M80), with nominal masses of 9.7 g (150 gr), impacting at a velocity of 838 m/s\n(2,750 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against threats such as 223 Remington (5.56 mm FMJ), 30\nCarbine FMJ, and 12-gauge rifled slug, as well as the Type I through III-A threats.
