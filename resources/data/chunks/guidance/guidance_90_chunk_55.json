Due dates of SF-425 by quarter\nSF-425 due date\nApril 30\nJuly 30\nOctober 30\nJanuary 30 Reporting quarter\nJanuary 1–March 31\nApril 1–June 30\nJuly 1–September 30\nOctober 1–December 31 For your initial SF-425 submission, determine when the most recent SF-425 reporting quarter ended and complete\nan SF-425 to cover the period from the award start date of your award to the end of that period. You are required\nto submit an SF-425 even if you have not spent any money or incurred any costs during a reporting period. The\ndue dates for online filing of SF-425s are the same as for the submission of paper copies. Example: If your award start date is 02-01-17 and the current date is 04-15-17, then your first SF-425 will be due no later\nthan 04-30-17 and will cover the period 02-01-17 (award start date) through 03-31-17 (end of the most recent\nreporting quarter). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office so that you can successfully complete a\ndrawdown of funds through GPRS. Award recipients who do not submit an SF-425 report by the due date each quarter will be unable to draw down\nfunds. The payment system contains a function, which checks for SF-425 delinquency and will reject a drawdown\nattempt if the SF-425 is not current. Subsequent outreach through email, fax, or hard copy reminders may be sent\nto the recipient if the SF-425 is delinquent. For general information concerning online filing of SF-425 reports, go to www.cops.usdoj.gov or contact the COPS\nOffice Response Center by phone at 800-421-6770 or by email at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov.

How will award funds be monitored? The COPS Office and designated representatives from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of Justice\nPrograms monitor the financial aspects of your organization’s award through financial reports, on-site visits, officebased award reviews, meetings, telephone contacts, reports, audits, reviews of award change requests, and\nspecial request submissions.
