Please electronically sign the award document and all award condition pages within 90 days of the date on the\naward congratulatory letter. Award funds will not be released until we have received your agency’s signed award\ndocument, your budget has received final clearance, and any other relevant award conditions particular to your\nagency have been satisfied. Failure to electronically sign your original award document within the 90-day award\nacceptance period may result in your SVPP award being withdrawn and the funds deobligated without additional\nnotification. If your agency requires an extension for accepting the award beyond the 90-day acceptance\ntimeframe, you will be able to request an extension through the online system. Be sure to explain the\ncircumstances that prevent your agency from electronically signing the award document within the 90-day period,\nand identify the date by which the award document will be signed. The COPS Office will review such requests on a\ncase-by-case basis. The COPS Office reserves the right to deny requests to extend the 90-day award acceptance\nperiod.

Procurement Process In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition when feasible. For\nthe purchase of equipment, technology, or services under a COPS Office award, recipients must follow their own\npolicies and procedures on procurement as long as those requirements conform to the federal procurement\nrequirements set forth in 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.317 – 200.326. As described in the award condition titled “Sole Source Justification,” recipients are required to submit a sole\nsource justification (SSJ) request to the COPS Office for noncompetitive procurements in excess of $250,000 prior\nto purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract; or entering into a contract\nwith award funds. If submitting a sole source justification request to the COPS Office, please use the format\ndescribed in the Sole Source Justification fact sheet at https://cops.usdoj.gov/svpp#programdocuments. If you have any questions regarding the federal requirements that guide procurement procedures, please contact\nyour COPS Office Grant Program Specialist.
