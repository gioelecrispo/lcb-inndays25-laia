Reporting Requirements As an SVPP award recipient, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Programmatic Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report SVPP award\nfunding separately from all other funding sources, in order to ensure accurate financial and programmatic\nreporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have adequate financial internal controls in place\nto monitor the use of all funding, and also to ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms and conditions. Good stewardship in this area includes written accounting practices, use of an accounting system that adequately\ntracks all award drawdowns and expenditures, and has the ability to track when award-funded positions are filled\nor approved purchases are made. Failure to submit complete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result\nin the suspension and possible termination of your agency’s COPS Office award funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit a quarterly Federal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the\naward period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period\nand the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to\ndraw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however, you will have a 90-day\ngrace period after the award end date during which you can draw down funds for eligible expenditures incurred\nbefore the award end date. How do we file Federal Financial Reports? All COPS Office award recipients are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Recipients are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office Agency Portal\nwebsite at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov to log in; once you are logged in, select “Applications” from the agency\nportal menu, click on the “SF-425” icon, and follow the instructions to complete and submit your reports. The\nonline SF-425 requires the same reporting information as the paper version. The use of this online application\nenables authorized users to view past reports and allows them to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter.
