All licensing, publishing, or similar agreements with a copyright holder, publisher, or other relevant party shall\ninclude provisions giving the Federal Government a royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable license to\nreproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, the publication for Federal Government\npurposes. 30. Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using TRGP Equipment/Training funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must\ncomply with operating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. The recipient acknowledges that it has completed, signed,\nand submitted with its Federal award the relevant special condition certifying its compliance with 28 C.F.R. Part 23.\n62 2018 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. An\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system which receives, stores, analyzes,\nand exchanges or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems that protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use TRGP award funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms of\ntechnology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not apply\nto this award. What you should do:\nAll COPS Office award recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence\nSystems/28 C.F.R. Part 23 as part of their award acceptance so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to\nuse their award funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use\naward funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should indicate this on the Criminal\nIntelligence Systems 28 C.F.R. Part 23 Compliance form that was included with your award package and certify and\nsubmit this form along with your signed award document as your agency’s agreement to comply with the\noperating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Your agency must now comply with 28 C.F.R. Part 23 in operating\nthe interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system funded through your COPS Office award. 31. Community policing\nCondition:\nCommunity policing activities to be initiated or enhanced by your agency were identified and described in your\ngrant application. All equipment, technology, training, and/or sworn officer positions awarded under the TRGP\naward must be linked to the implementation or enhancement of community policing. (34 U.S.C. § 10382 (c)(10)) Why this condition:"
