Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted from a\nviolation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, award terms and conditions, or other\ndocument governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable and do not\nreflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because costs at the time\nof the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. • Policy and procedure. Weaknesses are identified in a recipient’s accounting practices, fiscal stewardship,\naccuracy of data used in the development of the award applications, and/or inventory controls that led to the\nrecommendation cited in the audit. The recipient is required to develop or revise policies and/or procedures\nconsistent with their existing practices and submit to the COPS Office to forward to the OIG to close the\nrecommendation. After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division’s Audit Liaison Section\nwill continue working as the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings.

Reporting Requirements As a PASS award recipient, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Programmatic Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report PASS award\nfunding separately from all other funding sources, in order to ensure accurate financial and programmatic\nreporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have adequate financial internal controls in place\nto monitor the use of all funding, and also to ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms and conditions. Good stewardship in this area includes written accounting practices, use of an accounting system that adequately\ntracks all award drawdowns and expenditures, and has the ability to track when award-funded positions are filled\nor approved purchases are made. Failure to submit complete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result\nin the suspension and possible termination of your agency’s COPS Office award funding or other remedial actions.
