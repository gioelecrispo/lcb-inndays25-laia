  "chunk_text": "Where should time staff spent working on the conference that is not related to planning be captured? Time spent working on a conference by staﬀ or contractors can be classiﬁed as either logistical planning time\nor programmatic planning time. Programmatic planning includes time spent on activities such as developing\nthe conference content and agenda, identifying and recruiting subject matter experts, and preparing written 84 materials. Logistical planning includes time spent on tasks such as selecting a venue, ordering and setting up\naudio-video equipment, securing hotel rooms, processing registrations, providing onsite support during the\nevent, and undertaking other non-programmatic functions. 4. If a cooperative agreement recipient or contractor is able to obtain a no-cost site for the event, are we still\nrequired to look into other facilities and provide justiﬁcation for not selecting the other facilities? Yes. Cooperative agreement recipients and contractors should compare three or more facilities in a location. Facilities being compared should have provided a cost estimate and be able to accommodate the event as\ndetailed in the requirements. A desired hotel may oﬀer an incentive of no overall facility cost (e.g., for meeting\nrooms or audio-visual equipment) but may not be economical in other cost comparison items such as the\navailability of lodging at per diem rates, travel distance for attendees, etc. Also, recipients and contractors\nshould maintain written documentation justifying their decision to select the chosen location in the event of a\nfuture audit. 5. Is there a timeframe after the COPS Oﬃce accepts a conference request that a cooperative agreement\nrecipient or contractor can expect notiﬁcation of approval? Each event request (meeting, conference, webinar, etc.) is unique in reference to how it will accomplish the\nCOPS Oﬃce’s mission. The key to any conference request moving through the review process depends on\nwhether the package is complete. A complete package contains a detailed cost analysis and suﬃcient\njustiﬁcation to support all categories within the package. Example: An event is submitted for approval and consists of the following categories: printing and distribution,\nmeals and incidental expenses (M&IE), lodging, transportation, and trainer or facilitator costs. The package\ncontains a detailed cost analysis of each cost category (e.g., one trainer at $450 per day x 2 days = $900) and\nadequate justiﬁcation explaining the purpose of the event and the role of the trainer. This package can move\nthrough the review process in a few days and allow ample time for travelers to make reservations, if the\npackage was submitted within the required timeframe. However, if the trainer or facilitator’s costs in the\nsubmitted package exceed the COPS Oﬃce’s threshold and if supporting justiﬁcation was not included, a delay\nmay occur while this justiﬁcation is being retrieved. To avoid delays in the approval process, all recipients and contractors should adhere to the timeframe\nrequirements for the dollar amount of their proposed event. 6. Once an event is approved, how do we handle any increases or decreases in the amount of attendees\noriginally proposed on the cost analysis spreadsheet submitted to the DOJ for approval?"
