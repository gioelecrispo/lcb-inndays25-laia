Please be advised that 2 C.F.R. § 200.343(a) requires recipients to submit final SF-425s and 2 C.F.R. § 200.343(b)\nrequires recipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of\nthe award. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your organization may have unobligated and unspent award funds remaining in your account\nfollowing the award period due to an overestimate of item costs during the application period. Your organization\nshould review its records carefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual\ncosts incurred during the award period. Any remaining unobligated or unspent funds should remain in your\naccount, and will be deobligated during the closeout process. 68 2019 COPS Office Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act (LEMHWA) Program Award Owner’s Manual Final Program Progress (Closeout) Report After your award period has ended, your organization may be sent a final progress or closeout report from the\nCOPS Office and asked to complete it. This report will serve as your agency’s final programmatic report on the\naward, and the information your organization provides in this report will be used to make a final assessment of\nyour award progress. Equipment disposition\nEach recipient must use any equipment funded through a COPS Office award for approved award-related purposes\nand must retain the equipment for the life of the award. After the conclusion of the award period, property\nrecords must be maintained by the recipient. The records should include a description of the property; a serial\nnumber or other identification number; the source of the property; the name of the person or entity that holds the\ntitle; the acquisition date and cost of the property; the percentage of federal participation in the cost of the\nproperty; the location, use, and condition of the property; and any ultimate disposition data, including the date of\ndisposal and sale price of the property. A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to\nprevent loss, damage, or theft of the property.
