  "chunk_text": "Proposed printing costs for participant materials\nshould also be itemized and brieﬂy described. Speciﬁcally, it is important to articulate why printed materials\nare needed instead of making materials available electronically (at low or no cost) to attendees before or\nafter the event. • Insuﬃcient explanation and justiﬁcation of shipping costs. Provide an itemization of these costs, along with a\nbrief description of why the equipment and other materials being shipped are essential to hosting a\nsuccessful conference. 87 • Insuﬃcient explanation and justiﬁcation of consultant costs. The maximum daily rate for subject matter\nexperts who are being reimbursed for their time is noted here. Describe all consultant costs in detail, and\ninclude a brief yet compelling justiﬁcation for the proposed costs. Daily rates for subject matter experts\nabove the maximum daily rate require prior approval by the COPS Oﬃce and DOJ. In cases where higher rates\nare included in the event submission, written documentation of prior approval is required and should be\nattached. 14. Should I continue to exclude all food and beverage costs in my event submissions? Yes. The inclusion of food and beverage costs will delay the review process, and these costs are not likely to be\napproved. The only exception is when the location of the conference does not allow attendees to obtain food\nor beverages on their own or when this restriction would greatly disrupt the conference schedule. If you\nbelieve your event qualiﬁes for such a rare exception, contact your Program Manager to discuss it before\ncompleting and submitting your form. If meals are included in your event submission, remember that\nattendees must subtract the meal costs from the M&IE reimbursement for the days on which the meals will\noccur. 15. Can you summarize what I can do to prevent follow-up questions about my submitted events that delay the\nreview and approval process? As a general rule, explain how you derived every cost that you include in the conference submission form. For\nlines that do not provide space for you to add descriptive narrative, include your explanations and speciﬁc cost\nbreakdowns in a separate tab or in a separate document that is submitted with the form. In addition, include\nthe cooperative agreement or contract number on the form. 16. What events qualify for the expedited review process? There is no expedited review process. Every eﬀort is made to review all events as quickly as possible. Most delays result from a need for additional information. Event requests are prioritized for review by\nbalancing the following three criteria:\n• The start date of the event;\n• The date the event submission was received by COPS Oﬃce; and\n• The overall cost and complexity of the event. For example, conferences requiring approval by the assistant\nattorney general’s administration and the deputy attorney general (over $100,000–$250,000) typically take\nlonger to process, as they must go through COPS Oﬃce and DOJ reviews, result in more questions, and are\nmore likely to have issues related to cost thresholds.
