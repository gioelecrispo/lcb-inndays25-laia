  "chunk_text": "Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within 30\ndays after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the award\nperiod. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period and the\nremaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw\ndown federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however, you will have a 90-day grace\nperiod after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before\nthe award end date. How do we file a Federal Financial Report (SF-425)? All COPS Office award recipients are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Recipients are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office website at\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov and select the “Account Access” link in the upper right corner to log in; once you are logged\nin, select “Applications” from the agency portal menu, click on the “SF-425” icon, and follow the instructions to\ncomplete and submit your reports. The online SF-425 requires the same reporting information as the paper\nversion. The use of this online application enables authorized users to view past SF-425s and allows them to file or\namend the SF-425 for the current quarter. Please see the Agency Portal User Manual at\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2018AwardDocs/Agency_Portal_GrantsMgt_Manual.pdf for detailed instructions on\nfederal financial reports.
