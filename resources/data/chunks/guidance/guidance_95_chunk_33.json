However, in\nsome instances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: An award recipient must request written approval from the COPS Office for sole source procurement in excess of\n$150,000 prior to purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract; or entering into\na contract with award funds. For the purchase of equipment, technology, or services under a COPS Office award,\nrecipients must use their own documented procurement procedures that reflect applicable state and local laws\nand regulations, as long as those requirements conform to the federal procurement requirements set for in 2\nC.F.R. § 200.320. A sole source justification request should be submitted if a recipient determines that the award\nof a contract through a competitive process is not feasible. The COPS Office may authorize a noncompetitive\nproposal if one or more of the following circumstances apply:\n• The item/service is available only from one source. • The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive\nsolicitation. • The COPS Office authorizes noncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the recipient. • Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. The COPS Office will review your request and the supporting information that you provide and will make a\ndetermination as to whether or not an exception can be granted to the general rule regarding competition. If\nsubmitting a sole source justification request to the COPS Office, please use the format described in the section\n“Procurement Process”. For more information on sole source justification, please review the fact sheet: http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2017AwardDocs/Sole_Source_Justification_FactSheet.pdf.
