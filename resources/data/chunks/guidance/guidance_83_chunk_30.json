TRGP-Hiring awards\nmust be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities. All newly hired, additional, or rehired officers (or\nan equal number of redeployed veteran officers) funded under TRGP-Hiring must engage in community policing\nactivities. While the COPS Office recognizes that your COPS Office-funded officer(s) (or an equal number of\nredeployed veteran officers) will participate in some or all aspects of your identified community policing plan and\nadvance your agency’s community policing activities over the life of the award, we also encourage your agency to\nmove toward an organization-wide philosophy and commitment to community policing. COPS Office awards are designed to increase community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This is\nachieved through problem-solving tactics and community policing partnerships. It enhances police professionalism\nby providing officers with the skills and motivation to act in innovative ways to solve community crime-related\nproblems. Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure that it is initiating or enhancing community\npolicing in accordance with your proposed plan, and that the officers hired (or an equal number of redeployed\nveteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance your agency’s community policing activities over the\nlife of the award. The COPS Office may also use this information to understand the needs of the field and\npotentially provide for training, technical assistance, problem solving, and community policing implementation\ntools. What you should do: The community policing activities designated for implementation or enhancement by your agency were identified\nin your TRGP application. Your community policing needs may change during the life of your award, and minor\nchanges to this plan may be made without prior approval of the COPS Office. If your agency’s community policing\nplan changes significantly you must submit those changes in writing to the COPS Office for approval. Changes are\nsignificant if they deviate from the range of possible community policing activities identified and approved in the\noriginal community policing plan submitted with your application. 27. Retention\nCondition: At the time of award application, your agency committed to retaining all sworn officer positions funded under the\nTRGP-Hiring award with state and/or local funds for a minimum of 12 months following the conclusion of 36\nmonths of federal funding for each position, over and above the number of locally-funded sworn officer positions\nthat would have existed in the absence of the award. Your agency cannot satisfy the retention requirement by using\nTRGP-Hiring-funded positions to fill locally-funded vacancies resulting from attrition. Why this condition: The retention requirement ensures that the increased officer staffing level under the TRGP-Hiring award continues\nwith state or local funds for a minimum of 12 months after federal funding ends."
