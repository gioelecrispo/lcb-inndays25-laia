  "chunk_text": "The award document The award document is the document indicating your official award funding amount, the award number, the\naward conditions, and the award start and end dates. The award document is pre-printed with your agency’s law enforcement and government executives’ names. If this\ninformation is incorrect or has changed, please update your agency contacts online at www.cops.usdoj.gov\nthrough the “Account Access” tab. If the law enforcement or government official has changed since the time of\napplication, please have the current law enforcement executive or government executive for your agency create\nan account through the “Account Access” link, log in, and sign the award document once your agency contacts\nhave been updated online. Once you have reviewed your award document, please electronically sign it and make a\ncopy of all pages of the document for your records, along with all award condition pages, within 90 days of the\ndate shown on the award congratulatory letter. Please see the “Accepting the award” in this manual. The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed for any\nallowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your CAMP award is two years (24 months). Your award number is in the following format: 2017-AMWX-0000 for awards funded in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. The\nCOPS Office tracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency’s\naward number (or your agency’s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI, the COPS Office assigns a\nnonofficial ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two characters will be “ZZ”). If you have\nany questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your agency’s ORI number when you\ncontact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency’s nine- or thirteendigit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP vendor\nnumber differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for administrative\npurposes in connection with this award program, and should not be used for IRS purposes. 2 2017 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual Award terms and conditions The award terms and conditions are listed on your agency’s award document. By accepting this award, you are\nobtaining federal funds from the COPS Office. As part of that agreement, your agency acknowledges that it will\ncomply with the terms and conditions (and, if applicable, additional special or high risk conditions specific to your\nagency). The section that follows describes in detail all of the award conditions, their rationales, and their\nimplications."
