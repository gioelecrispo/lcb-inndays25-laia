An indirect cost rate proposal as defined in 2 C.F.R. § 200.57\nis the documentation prepared by a nonfederal entity to\nsupport its request for the establishment of an indirect cost\nrate, as described in Appendix III to 2 C.F.R. Part 200,\nIndirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate\nDetermination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs)\nthrough Appendix VII to 2 C.F.R. Part 200, States and Local\nGovernment and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals. What are indirect costs? Indirect Facilities & Administrative (F&A) costs are costs\nincurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more\nthan one cost objective. They are not readily attributable\nto the cost objectives that are being benefited. To facilitate\nequitable distribution of indirect expenses to the specific\ncost objectives, it may be necessary to establish a number\nof pools of indirect (F&A) costs. Indirect (F&A) cost pools\nmust be distributed to benefited cost objectives on bases\nthat will produce equitable results in consideration of relative\nbenefits derived. 1 1 See 2 C.F.R. § 200.56 in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit\nRequirements for Federal Awards, as adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. § 2800.101. Indirect (facilities & administrative (F&A)) costs\nare costs incurred for a common or joint purpose\nbenefiting more than one cost objective. They are\nnot readily attributable to the cost objectives that are\nbeing benefited. There are several types of indirect cost rates:\n Final rate is applicable to a specified past period that is\nbased on the actual costs of the period. A final audited\nrate is not subject to adjustment.  Fixed rate has the same characteristics as a predetermined\nrate except that the difference between estimated costs\nand actual allowable costs of the covered period is carried\nforward as an adjustment for a future period.  One-time extension allows your agency to apply for a\none-time extension of a negotiated indirect (F&A) cost\nrate. The negotiated cost rate may be extended for up\nto four years. Once your cognizant federal agency has\napproved an extension for indirect costs, you must abide\nby the rate for the agreed-upon time period. No further\nnegotiations regarding indirect cost rates may occur until\nthe extension has expired. At the end of the extension\nperiod, you must negotiate a new indirect cost rate. Indirect Cost Rate  Predetermined rate is applicable to a specified current\nor future period and is not subject to adjustment. A\npredetermined rate may be used where there is reasonable\nassurance that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based\non the agency’s actual costs. Predetermined rates may not\nbe used by governmental units that have not submitted\nand negotiated the rate with the cognizant federal agency.  Provisional rate is a temporary rate applicable to a\nspecified time period that is used for funding, interim\nreimbursement, and reporting of indirect costs pending\nestablishment of a final rate for that period. "
