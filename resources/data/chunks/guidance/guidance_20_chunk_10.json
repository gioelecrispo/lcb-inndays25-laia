Additionally, by the conditions of this award,\nyou are required to track all overtime funded through the COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program. Training To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n Any training provided by the COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program is in addition to the number of hours of\ntraining already provided by your agency. Funds currently allocated for training may not be reallocated to\nother purposes. Note: This award condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your agency\nunder this award. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any state or locally funded partnership agencies use\nCOPS Office funds only to supplement, not supplant, their state or local funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 24 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 24 months will be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted nocost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays, or other\ncircumstances that interrupt the 24 month award funding period. An extension allows your agency to compensate\nfor such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 24 months of funding. 2 C.F.R. § 200.308(d)(2). Extension requests must be received prior to the end date of the award. 9 2019 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner’s Manual Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the award end date. Requests\nto extend the award period must be submitted online and received by the COPS Office before the official award\nend date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will only be considered when the recipient\nprovides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance where an\nunforeseen natural disaster prevented a recipient from requesting an extension. Failure to submit a request for a\nno-cost time extension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. All extension requests require review and approval by the COPS Office. Individual or cumulative requests greater\nthan one-half of the award’s original term (i.e., 12 months) will require additional justification and must include a\ndetailed timeline."
