  "chunk_text": "• Insuﬃcient explanation and justiﬁcation of transportation costs. Remember to break out and brieﬂy describe\nand justify the transportation costs that are included. Example: If participants are ﬂying to your event and the\ntickets are being paid for with DOJ funding, you should include the anticipated number of people ﬂying\nmultiplied by the estimated cost per ticket. If cars will be rented, you should include a brief justiﬁcation for\nwhy rental cars are being used instead of another form of ground transportation, such as taxis or shuttles. • Insuﬃcient explanation and justiﬁcation of audio-visual costs. All audio-visual costs should be broken out and\nbrieﬂy described. The quantity of equipment to be rented (number of microphones, projectors, etc.) should\nbe included, along with relevant costs and a brief justiﬁcation for why the proposed equipment is required to\nconduct a successful meeting. A discussion of how the audio-visual services provider was selected should be\nincluded (for example, did you obtain three quotes?). • Insuﬃcient explanation and justiﬁcation of printing costs. Proposed printing costs for participant materials\nshould also be itemized and brieﬂy described. Speciﬁcally, it is important to articulate why printed materials\nare needed instead of making materials available electronically (at low or no cost) to attendees before or\nafter the event. • Insuﬃcient explanation and justiﬁcation of shipping costs. Provide an itemization of these costs, along with a\nbrief description of why the equipment and other materials being shipped are essential to hosting a\nsuccessful conference. • Insuﬃcient explanation and justiﬁcation of consultant costs. The maximum daily rate for subject matter\nexperts who are being reimbursed for their time is noted here. Describe all consultant costs in detail, and\ninclude a brief yet compelling justiﬁcation for the proposed costs. Daily rates for subject matter experts 87 above the maximum daily rate require prior approval by the COPS Oﬃce and DOJ. In cases where higher rates\nare included in the event submission, written documentation of prior approval is required and should be\nattached. 14. Should I continue to exclude all food and beverage costs in my event submissions? Yes. The inclusion of food and beverage costs will delay the review process, and these costs are not likely to be\napproved. The only exception is when the location of the conference does not allow attendees to obtain food\nor beverages on their own or when this restriction would greatly disrupt the conference schedule. If you\nbelieve your event qualiﬁes for such a rare exception, contact your Program Manager to discuss it before\ncompleting and submitting your form. If meals are included in your event submission, remember that\nattendees must subtract the meal costs from the M&IE reimbursement for the days on which the meals will\noccur. 15. Can you summarize what I can do to prevent follow-up questions about my submitted events that delay the\nreview and approval process? As a general rule, explain how you derived every cost that you include in the conference submission form."
