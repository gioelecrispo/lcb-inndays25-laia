The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits are\ndesigned to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on an\nannual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the\nOIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the geographical distribution of\nawards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and expired), and type of award (hiring\nand nonhiring). As such, the fact that a recipient has been selected for an OIG audit is not necessarily indicative of\na suspected concern or problem area. 62 2019 COPS Office Preparing for Active Shooter Situations (PASS) Program Award Owner’s Manual What are the steps in an OIG audit? The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division’s Audit Liaison Section serves as the liaison between recipients and the\nOIG’s Audit Division, which conducts the audit. The OIG steps in the audit process will determine the interactions\nbetween the OIG, the recipient, and the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division Audit Liaison Section:\n• Call for award data. The OIG requests award documentation from the COPS Office. • Entrance conference. The OIG schedules to meet with the recipient to gather documentation and conduct\naudit. • Draft audit report. The OIG reviews documentation and presents initial recommendations (findings) to the\nrecipient and copies the COPS Office. The COPS Office interacts with the recipient to coordinate any\nrepayments and/or policy or procedure documents to be submitted to the OIG before release of the Final\nAudit Report. • Final audit report. The OIG has completed its direct interaction with the recipient. The COPS Office directs\nthe recipient to formulate a Corrective Action Plan to address recommendations (findings). As each\nrecommendation is successfully addressed by the recipient, the COPS Office requests closure on the\nrecommendation. • Closing the audit. When all recommendations have been closed, the COPS Office requests closure on the\naudit from the OIG and notifies the recipient that the audit is closed. If you have any questions regarding an OIG audit, please contact the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division’s Audit\nLiaison Section via the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. Questions and comments regarding the\nadministration of your COPS Office PASS award, not specifically related to an audit, should be referred to your\nCOPS Office Program Manager.
