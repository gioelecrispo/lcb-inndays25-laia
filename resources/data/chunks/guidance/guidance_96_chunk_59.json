  "chunk_text": "It encourages the\napplication of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the entire\ndepartment, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem solving\nand partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and communication that\ntake place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing’s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of doing business. 62 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner’s Manual Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part of\nthe process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor groups\nin agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing implementation. Decision-making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision-making. Decentralized\ndecision-making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision-making\ninvolves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving efforts, and\nallowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various\nresources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community\nwill help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan is to\nhave value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their\nefforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization’s mission and values statement should be\nsimple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures,\nwhere appropriate. Organizational evaluations"
