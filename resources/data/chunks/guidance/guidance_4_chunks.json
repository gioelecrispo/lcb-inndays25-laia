      "content": "Guidance on Web Accessibility and the ADA This guidance describes how state and local governments and businesses open to the public can\nmake sure that their websites are accessible to people with disabilities as required by the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA). +Learn more about businesses’ and state and local governments’ ADA responsibilities. Why Website Accessibility Matters\nInaccessible web content means that people with disabilities are denied equal access to\ninformation. An inaccessible website can exclude people just as much as steps at an entrance\nto a physical location. Ensuring web accessibility for people with disabilities is a priority for\nthe Department of Justice. In recent years, a multitude of services have moved online and\npeople rely on websites like never before for all aspects of daily living. For example,\naccessing voting information, finding up-to-date health and safety resources, and looking up\nmass transit schedules and fare information increasingly depend on having access to\nwebsites. People with disabilities navigate the web in a variety of ways. People who are blind may use\nscreen readers, which are devices that speak the text that appears on a screen. People who are\ndeaf or hard of hearing may use captioning. And people whose disabilities affect their ability to\ngrasp and use a mouse may use voice recognition software to control their computers and other\ndevices with verbal commands. The ways that websites are designed and set up can create unnecessary barriers that make it\ndifficult or impossible for people with disabilities to use websites, just as physical barriers like\nsteps can prevent some people with disabilities from entering a building. These barriers on the\nweb keep people with disabilities from accessing information and programs that businesses and\nstate and local governments make available to the public online. But these barriers can be\nprevented or removed so that websites are accessible to people with disabilities. Examples of Website Accessibility Barriers\n• Poor color contrast. People with limited vision or color blindness cannot read text if\nthere is not enough contrast between the text and background (for example, light gray\ntext on a light-colored background). • Use of color alone to give information. People who are color-blind may not have\naccess to information when that information is conveyed using only color cues because\nthey cannot distinguish certain colors from others. Also, screen readers do not tell the\nuser the color of text on a screen, so a person who is blind would not be able to know\nthat color is meant to convey certain information (for example, using red text alone to\nshow which fields are required on a form). • Lack of text alternatives (“alt text”) on images. People who are blind will not be able\nto understand the content and purpose of images, such as pictures, illustrations, and\ncharts, when no text alternative is provided. Text alternatives convey the purpose of an\nimage, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. • No captions on videos. People with hearing disabilities may not be able to understand\ninformation communicated in a video if the video does not have captions. • Inaccessible online forms."

People with hearing disabilities may not be able to understand\ninformation communicated in a video if the video does not have captions. • Inaccessible online forms. People with disabilities may not be able to fill out,\nunderstand, and accurately submit forms without things like:\no Labels that screen readers can convey to their users (such as text that reads\n“credit card number” where that number should be entered);\no Clear instructions; and\no Error indicators (such as alerts telling the user a form field is missing or incorrect). • Mouse-only navigation (lack of keyboard navigation). People with disabilities who\ncannot use a mouse or trackpad will not be able to access web content if they cannot\nnavigate a website using a keyboard. When the ADA Requires Web Content to be Accessible\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act applies to state and local governments (Title II)\nand businesses that are open to the public (Title III). State and local governments (Title II)\nTitle II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in all services,\nprograms, and activities of state and local governments. State and local governments must take\nsteps to ensure that their communications with people with disabilities are as effective as their\ncommunications with others. Many state and local government services, programs, and\nactivities are now being offered on the web. These include, for example, things like:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Applying for an absentee ballot;\nPaying tickets or fees;\nFiling a police report; Attending a virtual town meeting; Filing tax documents; Registering for school or school programs; and\nApplying for state benefits programs. A website with inaccessible features can limit the ability of people with disabilities to access a\npublic entity’s programs, services and activities available through that website—for example,\nonline registration for classes at a community college. For these reasons, the Department has consistently taken the position that the\nADA’s requirements apply to all the services, programs, or activities of state and\nlocal governments, including those offered on the web. Businesses that are open to the public (Title III)\nTitle III prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities by businesses open to the public\n(also referred to as “public accommodations” under the ADA). The ADA requires that businesses\nopen to the public provide full and equal enjoyment of their goods, services, facilities, privileges,\nadvantages, or accommodations to people with disabilities. Businesses open to the public must\ntake steps to provide appropriate communication aids and services (often called “auxiliary aids\nand services”) where necessary to make sure they effectively communicate with individuals with\ndisabilities. For example, communication aids and services can include interpreters, notetakers,\ncaptions, or assistive listening devices. Examples of businesses open to the public:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Retail stores and other sales or retail establishments; Banks; Hotels, inns, and motels;\nHospitals and medical offices;\nFood and drink establishments; and\nAuditoriums, theaters, and sports arenas. A website with inaccessible features can limit the ability of people with disabilities to access a\npublic accommodation’s goods, services, and privileges available through that website—for\nexample, a veterans’ service organization event registration form."

For these reasons, the Department has consistently taken the position that the\nADA’s requirements apply to all the goods, services, privileges, or activities\noffered by public accommodations, including those offered on the web. How to Make Web Content Accessible to People with\nDisabilities\nBusinesses and state and local governments have flexibility in how they comply\nwith the ADA’s general requirements of nondiscrimination and effective\ncommunication. But they must comply with the ADA’s requirements. The Department of Justice does not have a regulation setting out detailed standards , but the\nDepartment’s longstanding interpretation of the general nondiscrimination and effective\ncommunication provisions applies to web accessibility. 1\nBusinesses and state and local governments can currently choose how they will ensure that the\nprograms, services, and goods they provide online are accessible to people with disabilities. Existing technical standards provide helpful guidance concerning how to ensure accessibility of\nwebsite features. These include the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the\nSection 508 Standards, which the federal government uses for its own websites. Check out the\nresources section for more references. Even though businesses and state and local governments have flexibility in how\nthey comply with the ADA’s general requirements of nondiscrimation and\neffective communication, they still must ensure that the programs, services, and\ngoods that they provide to the public—including those provided online—are\naccessible to people with disabilities. 1 See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12132, 12182(a); 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130, 35.160(a), 36.201, 36.303(c). Businesses and state and local governments should consider a variety of website features when\nensuring that their websites are accessible. The resources section has links to organizations that\nexplain how to make websites accessible. Examples of what businesses should do to make\nwebsites accessible include (but are not limited to) the following practices:\n• Color contrast in text. Sufficient color contrast between the text and the background\nallows people with limited vision or color blindness to read text that uses color. • Text cues when using color in text. When using text color to provide information (such as\nred text to indicate required form fields), including text cues is important for people who\ncannot perceive the color. For example, include the word “required” in addition to red text\nfor required form fields. • Text alternatives (“alt text”) in images. Text alternatives convey the purpose of an\nimage, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. Text alternatives are used by people who\ndo not see the image, such as people who are blind and use screen readers to hear the alt\ntext read out loud. To be useful, the text should be short and descriptive. • Video captions. Videos can be made accessible by including synchronized captions that\nare accurate and identify any speakers in the video. • Online forms. Labels, keyboard access, and clear instructions are important for forms to be\naccessible."

Videos can be made accessible by including synchronized captions that\nare accurate and identify any speakers in the video. • Online forms. Labels, keyboard access, and clear instructions are important for forms to be\naccessible. Labels allow people who are blind and using screen readers to understand what\nto do with each form field, such as by explaining what information goes in each box of a job\napplication form. It is also important to make sure that people who are using screen\nreaders are automatically informed when they enter a form field incorrectly. This includes\nclearly identifying what the error is and how to resolve it (such as an automatic alert telling\nthe user that a date was entered in the wrong format). • Text size and zoom capability. People with vision disabilities may need to be able to use\na browser’s zoom capabilities to increase the size of the font so they can see things more\nclearly. • Headings. When sections of a website are separated by visual headings, building those\nheadings into the website’s layout when designing the page allows people who are blind to\nuse them to navigate and understand the layout of the page. • Keyboard and mouse navigation. Keyboard access means users with disabilities can\nnavigate web content using keystrokes, rather than a mouse. • Reporting accessibility issues. Websites that provide a way for the public to report\naccessibility problems allow website owners to fix accessibility issues. This is not a complete list of things to consider. There are many existing resources to help\nbusinesses and state and local governments with making websites accessible to people with\ndisabilities, some of which are included at the end of this document. Web Accessibility for People with Disabilities is a Priority\nfor the Department of Justice\nWhen Congress enacted the ADA in 1990, it intended for the ADA to keep pace with the rapidly\nchanging technology of our times. Since 1996, the Department of Justice has consistently taken\nthe position that the ADA applies to web content. As the sample cases below show, the\nDepartment is committed to using its enforcement authority to ensure website accessibility for\npeople with disabilities and to ensure that the goods, services, programs, and activities that\nbusinesses and state and local governments make available to the public are accessible. Title II Sample Cases\n• Project Civic Access: As part of the Department’s Project Civic Access enforcement\nwork, the Department has reached numerous agreements with cities and counties across\nthe country that include web accessibility requirements. For example, City and County of\nDenver, Colorado, City of Jacksonville, Florida, and City of Durham, North Carolina. • Miami University in Ohio: The Department reached an agreement with Miami\nUniversity in Ohio to resolve the United States’ lawsuit alleging that the university\ndiscriminated against students with disabilities by providing inaccessible web content\nand learning management systems. • Nueces County, Texas:"
