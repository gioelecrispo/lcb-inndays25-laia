    "text": "We therefore only conclude, based on the above analysis, to\na reasonable degree of certainty, that with respect to\ninvestigatory expenses amortization, \u00a7 195 applies only to the\ncreation of a new business or acquisition of a business in a\ndifferent field. (b) How should -- alleged \u201cinvestigatory expenses\u201d be treated? --- treated the $--- paid to ---- as \u201cinvestigatory\nexpenses\u201d and started amortizing it in - under \u00a7 195. Whether\nthese expenses in question qualify as investigatory expenses\nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 195 depends on the relevant facts and\ncircumstances, not on how --- labels them. Of all the listed services for which - paid -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, only the one in (i),\nadvice on value creation of --- acquisition, ostensibly qualifies\nunder \u00a7 195 as \u201ccosts of seeking and reviewing prospective\nbusinesses prior to reaching a decision to acquire\u201d a business. (The dollar amount to be allocated to this advice is a question\nof fact, and --- has to itemize the service fees paid and\nsubstantiate the itemization.) However, as discussed in Part (a)\nin this Analysis, because - and -- were in the same field of\nbusiness, this expense is not eligible for amortization under\n\u00a7 195. In any event, the payment for the remaining services should\nbe capitalized under \u00a7 263. Section 263 provides that no\ndeduction is allowed for any amount paid out for new buildings or\nfor permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the\nvalue of any property or estate. I.R.C. ' 263(a). In applying\n' 263, instead of solely looking at the increased value to\nconcrete assets, Courts have focused on the long-term effect that\nexpenditures generate, and maintained that there does not have to\nexist a physical asset for ' 263 to apply. See INDOPCO Inc. v.\nCommissioner, 503 U.S. 79 (1992); Wells Fargo v. Commissioner,\n224 F.3d 874 (2000). AA taxpayer=s realization of benefits beyond\nthe year in which the expenditure is incurred is undeniably\nimportant in determining whether the appropriate tax treatment is\nimmediate deduction or capitalization.@ 503 U.S. at 87. CC:LM:NR:HOU:2: POSTF 163829-02 page 10 When an expenditure does not create or enhance a separate\nand distinct asset, the determination whether to capitalize or\ndeduct this expenditure depends, to a certain extent, on the\npresence of a long-term benefit associated with that expenditure. See Wells Fargo, 224 F.3d at 884 (emphasis added). Expenses\nAincurred for the purpose of changing the corporate structure for\nthe benefit of future operations are not ordinary and necessary\nbusiness expenses.@ Id. at 89. The INDOPCO Court has also stated:\nDeductions for professional expenses thus have\nbeen disallowed in a wide variety of cases\nconcerning changes in corporate structure. Although support for these decisions can be\nfound in the specific terms of ' 162, which\nrequire that deductible expenses be Aordinary\nand necessary@ and incurred Ain carrying on any\ntrade or business,@ courts more frequently have\ncharacterized an expenditure as capital in\nnature because Athe purpose for which the\nexpenditure is made has to do with the\ncorporation=s operations and betterment,\nsometimes with a continuing capital asset, for\nthe duration of its existence or for the\nindefinite future or for a time somewhat longer\nthan the current taxable year.@ Id. at 89-90, citing General Bancshares Corp. v.\nCommissioner, 326 F.2d 712, 715 (8th Cir. 1964)\n(emphasis added).",

The tax compliance check will be\nlimited to an inquiry regarding whether an applicant\nhas filed all required individual or business tax\nreturns and whether the applicant has failed to pay, or\nmake proper arrangements with the Internal Revenue\nService for payment of, any Federal tax debts. The suitability check will be limited to an inquiry\nregarding whether an applicant has engaged in any\nconduct that would justify suspension or disbarment\nof any practitioner under the provisions of this part\non the date the application is submitted, including\nwhether the applicant has engaged in disreputable\nconduct as defined in \u00a710.51. The application will\nbe denied only if the results of the compliance or\nsuitability check are sufficient to establish that the\npractitioner engaged in conduct subject to sanctions\nunder \u00a7\u00a710.51 and 10.52. (2) If the applicant does not pass the tax\ncompliance or suitability check, the applicant will\nnot be issued an enrollment or registration card or\ncertificate pursuant to \u00a710.6(b) of this part.

    "text": "6\nRev. Rul. 61-113, 1961-1 C.B. 400, dealt with individuals who served as members of a\nhearing board of an air pollution control district, who were appointed by the county\nboard of supervisors, took an oath of office, held public hearings, and submitted their\ndecisions to the county. They were not under the control and direction of the county\nboard of supervisors or any other body. Their compensation was based on the number\nof hearings they attended. The Ruling held that the board members services\nconstituted the performance of the functions of a public office and therefore did not\nconstitute a \u201ctrade or business\u201d for purposes of self-employment taxes under Code\nsection 1402(c)(1). Boards and commissions are created by state statute. Consultation of these statutes is\nlikely to show that these positions are defined as public officers of the states or their\npolitical subdivisions or instrumentalities. 7 In the case of the -------members, the -------statute establishing the position, as well as the detailed training and manual provided by\nthe State ----------------, appear to provide ample evidence that -------members are public\nofficials, and therefore employees for purposes of income tax withholding. For instance,\nthe ------ is created by state legislation and it functions in a quasi-judicial capacity. An --------member is entitled to judicial immunity for their actions concerning formal protest\nhearings. -------------------------------------------------------------------. The broad contours of the\n-------powers and responsibilities are defined by statute and more specifically described\nby the ------------------office, which may use its delegated authority to establish minimum\nstandards and procedures for the office. -------members perform their hearing and\ndecision duties in accordance with the state code and the procedures established by the\n----------------and by the ------ itself, but without direct control by the Board of Directors. The state statute also establishes a formal process for removing ------ members. The -------bears many similarities to the hearing board of the air pollution control district\nconsidered in Rev. Rul. 61-113. Members are appointed by a board of supervisors,\nmust take an official oath, and hold public hearings and submit their decisions to a ----------------official; however, they are not under the direction or control of that board. The --------members are also compensated on a per diem basis in accordance with ----------statutes. These statutory provisions and cases strongly support the view that in -------- an -------member is a public officer whose compensation is subject to income tax withholding\n6 We note that it is possible that some appointed officials may be given sufficient independence\nthat they would not be employees under the common law. 7 The ----------Attorney General has opined that------- members are \u201clocal public officials\u201d for purposes of\nspecial conflict of interest provisions found in C--------------------------------------------------------- Code. Section --------------- of the---------------------------Code defines \u201clocal\npublic official\u201d as \u201ca member of the governing body or another officer, whether elected, appointed, paid, or\nunpaid, of any district ... who exercises responsibilities beyond those that are advisory in nature.\u201d --------------------------------. ------- POSTF-123043-08 8 under section 3401(c). 2.

The recomputation consists of\nreclassifying b purchases from cooperative members into \u201cper-unit retain allocations\npaid in money\u201d [(within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a71382(b)(3)]. This is based on a PLR for\nthe taxpayer\u2019s tax year 20--- (the \u201cPLR\u201d) that concluded, inter alia, that the Coop\u2019s\npurchases fit into the definition of per-unit retains in Subchapter T of the Internal\nRevenue Code. 2 The Coop\u2019s reclassification and resulting recomputation result in a\nsignificantly larger section 199 domestic production activities deduction. Taxpayer received a Private Letter Ruling [PLR 200942022], (the \u201cPLR), using\nfacts from their tax year ended December 31, 20---. The same material facts that were\nfound in the PLR for the 20--- year are believed to exist for the year 20---. Consequently, those facts are set forth immediately below. In addition, the 20--- year\npresents additional material facts that were not present for the year 20---. Facts that\nwere not or may have not been considered in the PLR, which we consider to be material\nto the conclusion reached in this opinion for the tax year 20---, are set forth following\nthose in the PLR. PLR FACTS\nCoop is a farmers\u2019 cooperative organized as a cooperative corporation under State A\nlaw. Coop markets b for its farmer members. Principal commodities marketed are c, d,\nand f. Coop also provides a broad range of the farm supplies to its farmer members,\nincluding petroleum products (such as diesel fuel, propane, heating oil, and gasoline),\nplant food (fertilizers), agricultural chemicals (herbicides and pesticides), feed, and\nseed. 1 Specifically, Coop filed an amended Form 990-C, Farmer\u2019s Cooperative Association Income Tax Return,\nfor the taxable year 20---. It reduced its taxable income from g to h and its tax from i to j, from what the\nCoop reported in its original Form 990-C for said year. The Coop\u2019s amended Form 990-C claimed an\noverpayment of k (to be credited for 20--- estimated tax), which is the subject of this opinion. 2 This is not surprising. Almost any payment made in money to a member or a participating patron for\ncommodities that the Coop obtains from them and markets may be made to fit within the definition of a\nper-unit retain allocation for tax purposes, as allocations, made to patrons, being fixed with reference to\nthe products being marketed for the patron, and without reference to the net earnings of the cooperative. This opinion attempts to clarify that, this does not mean that closed sale proceeds and per-unit retains are\none and the same. POSTF-143023-10 3",
