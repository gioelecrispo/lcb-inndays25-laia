It is well settled that a legislative\nregulation must be upheld unless it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to\n[the] statute.\u201d Krukowski, 279 F.3d at 551 (quoting Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res.\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984)). Thus, \u201c[w]here the Commissioner POSTF-108700-08 10 acts under specific authority, [the Court\u2019s] primary inquiry is whether the interpretation or\nmethod is within the delegation of authority.\u201d Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U.S.\n247, 253 (1981). Under authority expressly delegated to him, the Secretary of the Treasury\nadopted regulations providing that a taxpayer owing interest to a related foreign party is\nentitled to a deduction for that interest only at the time the interest is paid. The effect of\nthe regulation is to place accrual basis taxpayers on the cash basis method of\naccounting with respect to such interest obligations. As stated above, the Tax Court in\nSquare D Co. and Subs v. Com\u2019r,118 T.C. 299 (2002), the Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle,\nInc. v. Com\u2019r, 87 F.3d 99 (1996) and the Seventh Circuit in Square D Co. and Subs v.\nCom\u2019r, 438 F.3d 739 (2006) have all held the regulation valid under the authority\ndelegated to the Secretary by I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3), as a permissible interpretation of the\nstatutory scheme. The Supreme Court in Chevron laid out a two-step analysis to determine the\nvalidity of a regulation. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984). First, does the plain meaning of the relevant Code provision\nsupport the regulation and second, if the plain meaning is either silent or unclear as to\nthe regulations validity, then a court must evaluate the reasonableness of the\nCommissioner\u2019s determination. Square D & Subs. v. Com\u2019r, 438 F.3d 739, 744 (2006). Congress Remained Silent on How to Apply the Matching Principle of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2)\nI.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3) directs the Secretary to adopt regulations applying \u201cthe\nmatching principle\u201d of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) \u201cin cases in which the person to whom the\npayment is to be made is not a United States person.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3). The Tax Court\nin Square D discussed above, like the Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle, 87 F.3d at 104\u201305,\nheld that Congress had not \u201cspoken to the precise question at issue,\u201d but rather had\nremained \u201csilent or ambiguous\u201d as to how the Secretary should apply that matching\nprinciple. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842. Thus, once it has been determined that \u201cthe statute is silent or ambiguous with\nrespect to the specific issue,\u201d how to specifically apply the matching principle of I.R.C. \u00a7\n267(a)(2), the second inquiry under the Supreme Court\u2019s Chevron doctrine is whether\nthe regulation \u201cis based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d Chevron, 467\nU.S. at 843. The Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle held the regulation valid because it \u201cis not\nmanifestly contrary to section 267(a)(3).\u201d 87 F.3d at 105.",

PREF-128548-08 2 2) If a MEGA credit constitutes income under \u00a7 61, does it constitute a contribution to\ncapital by a non-shareholder excludible under \u00a7 118(a)? 3) If a MEGA credit is a contribution to capital under \u00a7 118(a), does the amount reduce\nthe corporation\u2019s basis in the property under \u00a7 362(c)? CONCLUSIONS 1) The refundable MEGA Employment Credit is gross income to the extent Sub1\nreceives a refund of the credit, and it otherwise is a reduction in the amount of state\ntax expense under \u00a7 164. The nonrefundable MEGA Business Activity Credit is\nalways a reduction in the amount of state tax expense under \u00a7 164. 2) A refund of the MEGA Employment Credit does not constitute a contribution to\ncapital by a non-shareholder in any amount. 3) The MEGA credits do not reduce Parent or Sub1\u2019s basis in property under\n\u00a7 362(c)(2). FACTS\nAccording to the MEGA Tax Credit Agreement between Sub1 and MEGA (the\n\u201cAgreement\u201d), MEGA was created by the Michigan Economic Growth Authority Act with\nthe power to provide tax credits to businesses in order to \u201cpromote economic growth\nand to encourage private investment, job creation, and job upgrading\u201d for Michigan\nresidents. The Agreement is effective Date5 and contains two components: a Business\nActivity Credit and an Employment Credit. Sub1 built a new manufacturing plant in City1, Michigan, for the fabrication,\npainting, and assembly of its products. To be eligible for both the Business Activity\nCredit and the Employment Credit, Sub1 was required to create at least 75 \u201cqualified\nnew jobs\u201d by Date1. The Agreement also set out the minimum weekly wage for these\njobs, and affirmed that it would be no less than 150% of the minimum wage. On Date2,\nupon receiving these guaranties, MEGA granted Sub1 the tax credits. The MEGA credits are available to offset the Michigan Single Business Tax\n(\u201cSBT\u201d). The Business Activity Credit is a credit of 100 percent of the portion of Sub1\u2019s\nSBT liability attributable to the building project for which the MEGA credit was granted. The Employment Credit is a credit of 100 percent of the State of Michigan\u2019s personal\nincome tax rate in effect for each tax year, multiplied by the total eligible salaries and\nwages of employees in \u201cqualified new jobs.\u201d Each year, Sub1 must apply for the\ncredits, showing that it meets all of the Agreement\u2019s requirements. MEGA then issues\nSub1 an Annual Tax Certificate showing the approved credit amounts. Sub1 reports the\ncredits on its SBT returns, and the Employment Credit is refundable to the extent it\nexceeds Sub1\u2019s SBT liability for a given year.",

The City of ---------------was effectively holding those funds in trust for ---------------. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3264 provides in relevant part that:\u201c[t]he rights of all persons\nfurnishing labor, services, equipment, or materials for any work of improvement, with\nrespect to any fund for payment of construction costs, are governed exclusively by [Cal\nCiv Code sections 3156 through 3214] . . . and no person may assert any legal or\nequitable right with respect to such fund, . . . .\u201c See Falcon Construction Co. v. United\nStates, 1988 WL 383111 (E.D. Cal. 1988) (holding that the Service could levy withheld\nfunds, in part because no stop notice had been filed); see also Pankow Construction\nCo. v. Advance Mortgage Corp. et al, 618 F.2d 611 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding that \u201cclaims\non construction loan funds by persons furnishing services or material are confined\u201d to\nmechanics liens and stop notices). Further, at least one appellate court in California\nhas interpreted sections 3186 and 3193 as imposing an \u201cabsolute statutory duty\u201d on\nowners \u201cto pay the valid amounts of [stop notice] claims to the stop notice claimants and\nno one else.\u201d Stanislaus Pump v. City of Modesto, 200 Cal. App.3d 1442, 1447, 246\nCal. Rptr. 601, 604 (5th Dist. 1988). However, this case evaluated the ability of the\ncontractor to make an assignment, and not a competing claim of the United States. There are no reported cases in the Ninth Circuit on the effect of a \u201cStop Notice\u201d\nwhen it is competing with a federal tax lien or levy. Some cases indicate that the Circuit\nwould recognize the stop notice as depriving a contractor of property interest in withheld\ncontract proceeds. See, e.g., United States v. J.D. Grainger Co., Inc., 945 F.2d 259,\n262 (9th Cir. 1991) (\u201cA number of courts have held that a taxpayer-contractor has no\nproperty interest . . . in funds held by a surety or withheld by the contracting party for\npayment of subcontractors or other creditors of the taxpayer.\u201d). On the other hand,\nsome cases indicate some hostility toward this theory. See, e.g., American Fidelity Fire\nIns. Co. v. United States, 385 F.Supp. 1075, 1078 (N.D. Cal. 1974) (finding no support\nfor the premise that once a stop notice is issued, \u201cpayments due the contractor become\nnot property of the contractor, but a trust fund for the payment of laborers and\nmaterialmen\u201d). ---------------------, Wrongful Levy Page 6 Because the \u201cStop Notice\u201d is not a mechanic\u2019s lien, but rather an equitable\nremedy under state law, the Service\u2019s position is that the federal tax lien would\nordinarily prime the \u201cStop Notice.\u201d",
