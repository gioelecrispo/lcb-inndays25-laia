The ---------- -------- letter also argued the -------members themselves controlled the\nmaterial details of how they perform their duties. A large portion of the argument\nfocuses on the statutorily required independence of the ------, as it carries out its quasijudicial functions, from other functions of the ------------ district, such as prohibitions on\nex parte communications. -------- also provided a brief letter from an outside attorney\nstating support for the General Counsel\u2019s opinions and emphasizing the language of ----------------------Code \u00a7 ----------- by arguing, \u201cIt would be improper for the Service to take\na position that is contrary to such a clear expression of legislative intent.\u201d State law does not prevent the -------from being established as a separate entity with its\nown TIN and bank account. The --------------------- manager stated that the State was\nconsidering requiring the -------to \u201cshow\u201d independence from the ------------ district by\nobtaining a separate TIN and bank account and admitted that -------members would\nprobably be treated as employees of such a newly created separate entity.

The agreement states that none of the optional positions\nand services would be excluded. --------- also entered into an agreement, effective on -------------, -------, that eligible employees would be covered by the -------- state\nretirement system. LAW AND DISCUSSION\n1. Public Official Status for Income Tax Withholding Purposes\nI.R.C. \u00a7 3401(c) provides that, for income tax withholding purposes, the term\n\u201cemployee\u201d includes an officer, employee, or elected official of the United States, a\nState, or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or\nmore of the foregoing. Thus, by federal statute, public officers are specifically included\nwithin the term \u201cemployee\u201d for income tax withholding purposes (and conversely are not\n\u201cindependent contractors\u201d for income tax withholding purposes). Section 31.3401(c)1(a) of the Employment Tax Regulations clarifies the officers or employees can either\nbe elected or appointed. POSTF-123043-08 6 Whether a state worker is a public officer under section 3401(c) is determined by\nreference to local law. The Code does not define the term \u201cpublic officer,\u201d but section\n1.1402(c)-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations gives the following examples of persons\nperforming services of a \u201cpublic office\u201d: the president, the vice president, a governor, a\nmayor, the secretary of state, a member of Congress, a state representative, a county\ncommissioner, a judge, a justice of the peace, a county or city attorney, a marshal, a\nsheriff, a constable, a registrar of deeds, or a notary public. 4 There is, however, a body of case law defining the term \u201cpublic official.\u201d In Buckley v.\nValeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1975), the Supreme Court stated that anyone who exercises\nsignificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States is an officer. 5 The term\n\u201cofficers\u201d embraces all appointed officials exercising responsibility under the public laws\nof the nation.

    "text": "POSTF-143023-10 7 In very simple terms, Coop's b marketing business on behalf of its members consists of\nbuying b from members and participating patrons, handling and storing the b at its\nelevators, and then selling the b to customers. The issues in this opinion relate to the characterization for purposes of subchapter T of\nthe Code and section 199 of payments that Coop makes to its members and\nparticipating patrons when it acquires their b for marketing on a patronage basis, which\nwere originally characterized as \u201cpurchases\u201d and not as per-unit retains. The payments\nthat are the subject of this opinion (referred to as \u201cb payments\u201d) are amounts paid in\ncash to members and participating patrons for b delivered to Coop for marketing on a\npatronage basis. As the term is used in this opinion, \u201cb payments\u201d do not include any\namounts that Coop may pay to persons who are not members or participating patrons. Also, as the term is used in this opinion, \u201cb payments\u201d do not include patronage\ndividends paid to members and participating patrons with respect to b marketed for\nthem. Coop does not operate on a pooling basis. Thus, in contrast to cooperatives that use\npooling, the members of Coop do not commit to deliver all of the b they grow from\nspecified acreage to Coop to be pooled with the b of other members. Coop's members\nretain the commodity price risk until they decide to sell their b to Coop for marketing \u2014\nthe price risk does not shift to a pool after harvest as it does for pooling cooperatives. All\nmarketing proceeds are not shared equally on the basis of patronage, in the form of\nharvest advances and progress payments with a final settlement when the pool closes. Rather, Coop pays each member a market price for his or her b determined individually\nas described below. Payments are made in cash and occur throughout the year as\nmembers sell b to Coop for marketing on a cooperative basis. Coop then markets each\nmember's b along with the b of all of its members in the manner it thinks will produce the\nbest return. Finally, after net earnings for the year are determined (subtracting b\npayments in this determination), Coop pays a patronage dividend to its members with\nrespect to their b. This system of operation and marketing means that two members that market the same\nquantity and quality of b through Coop during any year will likely receive different b\npayments, though they will receive the same patronage dividend. Coop offers members several choices when they sell their b to Coop for marketing on a\ncooperative basis. Members can: (i) sell b to Coop in a spot sale at the current elevator\nbid price, (ii) sell b to Coop using a forward contract, (iii) sell b to Coop using a basis\ncontract, and (iv) sell b to Coop using hedge-to-arrive contract. The first and second\nalternatives are the ones most commonly used by members. Basis and hedge-to-arrive\ncontracts are less common. Coop offers different alternatives to accommodate the desire of many members who POSTF-143023-10 8",

    "text": "Treasury Regulation \u00a71.861-9T(h)(1) defines a\nrelated person for the fair market value method by a cross reference to Treas. Reg. \u00a71.8618T(c)(2). Treas. Reg. \u00a71.861-8T(c)(2) defines the term \u2018related person\u2019 as two or more persons\nin a relationship described in \u00a7267(b)(3). Whether a corporation is related to a partnership under\n\u00a7267(b)(10), a person is considered to own the partnership interest directly by such person and\nthe partnership interest owned with the application of \u00a7267(b)(3). Section 267(b)(10) defines a\n\u2018relationship\u2019 as \u201c(A) corporation and a partnership if the same persons own more than 50% in\nvalue of the outstanding stock of the corporation, and (B) more than 50% of the capital interest,\nor profits interest, in such partnership.\u201d Since TAXPAYER did not own an interest of more than 50% in the partnership in question, B\nshould not be considered a related person for purposes of applying the FMV election rules. 2. The Fungibility Concept (and Other Support for General\n\u201cEntity\u201d Approach)\nIn accordance with section 864(e) and Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(a), the interest expense of a\nconsolidated group generally must be apportioned based on all of the assets held by the group, CC:LM:HMT:CIN:1:POSTF-168001-03 Page 11 using average tax book values of fair market values. 3 The statute proceeds from the assumption\nthat money is fungible, and therefore borrowings effectively fund all the of the taxpayer\u2019s\nassets. 4 As the regulations explain: The method of allocation and apportionment for interest . . . is based on the\napproach that, in general, money is fungible and that interest expense is\nattributable to all activities and property regardless of any specific purpose for\nincurring an obligation on which interest is paid. . . . The fungibility approach\nrecognizes that all activities and property require funds and that management has a\ngreat deal of flexibility as to the source and use of funds. When borrowing will\ngenerally free other funds for other purposes, and [sic] it is reasonable under this\napproach to attribute part of the cost of borrowing to such other purposes. Consistent with the principles of fungibility, except as otherwise provided, the\naggregate of deductions for interest in all cases shall be considered related to all\nincome producing activities and assets of the taxpayer and, thus, allocable to all\nthe gross income which the assets of the taxpayer generate, have generated, or\ncould reasonably have been expected to generate. 5 The preamble to the regulations reiterates that under the fungibility approach interest is to be\nallocated based on the \u201cassets of the taxpayer.\u201d6 Under the interest apportionment rules, a \u201ctaxpayer\u201d is defined to include an affiliated group of\ncorporations, which, in general, has the same meaning as that term is given in section 1504\nexcept that section 936 corporations and certain directly or indirectly 80 percent controlled (as\nmeasured by vote or value) domestic corporations are also included within the definition. 7 Thus,\nin accordance with the regulations under section 864(e), the fungibility concept does not go\nbeyond the \u201cborder\u201d of a single taxpayer to, for example, less than 80 percent controlled\ndomestic corporations.",
