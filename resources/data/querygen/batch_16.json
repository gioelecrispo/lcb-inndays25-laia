(Emphasis added)\n2. If a retailer using the retail inventory method selects a price index from\nthe Producer Prices and Price Indexes, the selected index must be\nconverted into a retail price index. Retail price indexes may be derived\nfrom indexes selected from the Producer Price and Price Indexes by\nreference to the changes in the cost complements of the gross margins of\nan individual index category in the same manner as cost price indexes are\nderived in section 3.03 1. POSTF-134426-04 5 ANALYSIS The regulations in effect during the years at issue required manufacturers and certain\nretailers using the dollar-value LIFO method and the IPIC computation method\ndescribed in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.472-8(e)(3) to convert selected BLS indexes into cost price\nindexes before determining the LIFO value of their dollar-value pools. This conversion\nis necessary because indexes for LIFO purposes are based on the increases in cost,\nwhereas BLS indexes are based on the prices at which items are sold. Specifically, the\nCPI Detailed Report is based on retail sales prices and the PPI Detailed Report is\nbased on manufacturers\u2019 sales prices. Former Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.472-8(e)(3)(iii)(C) requires manufacturers and certain retailers\nto convert selected BLS indexes to cost price indexes before the indexes are used to\ndetermine the LIFO value of the inventory. In Rev. Proc. 84-57, the Service\ndemonstrated how IPIC method taxpayers must convert their BLS indexes to cost price\nindexes. Specifically, section 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 84-57, requires taxpayers to convert\nthe BLS indexes to cost price indexes using the gross profit percentage \u201cdetermined by\nthe taxpayer for each index category on the basis of its own average for the tax year.\u201d The taxpayer contends it is not required to determine the gross margin based on the\nentire year\u2019s data because Rev. Proc. 84-57 illustrates this requirement by use of a\nretailer, not a manufacturer. The taxpayer misinterprets Rev. Proc. 84-57. Although\nRev. Proc. 84-57 illustrates the requirement that an entire year\u2019s data be used to\nconvert from BLS indexes to cost price indexes using a retailer, its requirements are\nequally applicable to manufacturers. Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 84-57 states that the purpose of the revenue procedure was to\n\u201cprovide guidance to taxpayers that elect to use the dollar-value last-in, first-out (LIFO)\ninventory method and the inventory price index computation method described in\nsection 1.472-8(e)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations.\u201d Consequently, the principles\noutlined in Rev. Proc. 84-57 apply to retailers and manufacturers alike. The example involves a retailer that does not use the retail method but that selects\nindexes from the CPI Detailed Report. If this hypothetical retailer used the retail\ninventory method, it would not be required to adjust the CPI indexes because those\nindexes measure inflation in retail selling prices and the retail inventory method is a\nretail selling price-based inventory valuation method.",

The Taxpayer Relief\nAct of 199725 revised the rules with respect to when a foreign tax redetermination is\nconsidered to have occurred and what translation rate applies to foreign income taxes\npaid in foreign currencies. In lieu of the prior translation convention, whereby foreign taxes were translated\nat the time they were paid to the foreign country,26\nCongress believed that taxpayers that are on the accrual basis of\naccounting for purposes of determining creditable foreign taxes should be\npermitted to translate those taxes into U.S. dollar amounts in the year to\nwhich those taxes relate, and should not be required to make adjustments\nor redetermination [sic] to those translated amounts, if actual tax\npayments are made within a reasonably short period of time after the\nclose of such year. 27\nConsistent with that legislative history, section 986(a)(1)(A) states that, in the\ncase of any taxpayer who takes foreign income taxes in account when accrued, the\namount of any foreign income taxes is translated into dollars by using the average\nexchange rate for the taxable year to which such taxes relate. If taxes are paid after the\ndate that is two years after the close of the taxable year to which they relate, they are\ntranslated at the spot rate on the date of payment. 28 21 Id.\nId.\n23\nId.\n24\nId.\n25\nPub.L.

    "text": "Digital, electronic, or typed-font signatures\nare not valid signatures for Forms 1040\nor 1040-SR filed on paper. Requirements for an\nElectronic Return To file your return electronically, you\nmust sign the return electronically using\na personal identification number (PIN)\nand provide the information described\nbelow. If you are filing online using\nsoftware, you must use a Self-Select\nPIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a\nSelf-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. For 2022, if we issued you an identity\nprotection personal identification number (IP PIN) (as described in more detail\nbelow), all six digits of your IP PIN\nmust appear in the IP PIN spaces provi- ded next to the space for your occupation for your electronic signature to be\ncomplete. Failure to include an issued IP\nPIN on the electronic return will result\nin an invalid signature and a rejected return. If you are filing a joint return and\nboth taxpayers were issued an IP PIN,\nenter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN\nmethod allows you to create your own\nPIN. If you are married filing jointly,\nyou and your spouse will each need to\ncreate a PIN and enter these PINs as\nyour electronic signatures. A PIN is any combination of five digits you choose except five zeros. If you\nuse a PIN, there is nothing to sign and\nnothing to mail\u2014not even your Forms\nW-2. Your electronic return is considered a\nvalidly signed return only when it includes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your adjusted gross income (AGI) from your\noriginally filed 2021 federal income tax\nreturn, if applicable. If you're filing\njointly, your electronic return must also\ninclude your spouse's PIN, last name,\ndate of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and\nAGI, if applicable, in order to be considered validly signed. Don\u2019t use your AGI\nfrom an amended return (Form 1040-X)\nor a math error correction made by the\nIRS. AGI is the amount shown on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. If\nyou don\u2019t have your 2021 income tax return, call the IRS at 800-908-9946 to get\na free transcript of your return or visit\nIRS.gov/Transcript. (If you filed electronically last year, you, and your\nspouse if filing jointly, may use your\nprior year PIN to verify your identity instead of your prior year AGI. The prior\nyear PIN is the five-digit PIN you used\nto electronically sign your 2021 return.) You can't use the Self-Select\nPIN method if you are a\nCAUTION first-time filer under age 16 at\nthe end of 2022. ! Practitioner PIN. The Practitioner PIN\nmethod allows you to authorize your tax\npractitioner to enter or generate your\nPIN. Your electronic return is considered a validly signed return only when it\nincludes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, and IP PIN, if applicable. If you're -61- filing jointly, your electronic return must\nalso include your spouse's PIN, last\nname, date of birth, and IP PIN, if applicable in order to be considered validly\nsigned. The practitioner can provide you\nwith details. Form 8453. You must send in a paper\nForm 8453 if you have to attach certain\nforms or other documents that can't be\nelectronically filed.

In\nsuch cases, \u201cthe agreement may relate to one or more separate items affecting the tax\nliability of the taxpayer.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7121-1(b)(3). Therefore, the Closing Agreement is binding if it was properly executed in accordance\nwith section 7121 and the regulations thereunder, and, if binding, would bar the\nCommissioner from changing the taxpayer\u2019s item definitions if the parties so agreed in\nthe Closing Agreement. Interpretation of the Closing Agreement\nClosing agreements are created by statute and \"are authorized, and limited by, the\nlanguage of the statute.\u201d Marathon Oil Co. v. United States, 42 Fed.Cl. 267, 274\n(1998), aff\u2019d, 215 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 1999). When not otherwise limited by the\nstatute, courts apply principles of contract law when analyzing closing agreements. See\nMarathon Oil Co., 42 Fed. Cl. at 274; Smith v. United States, 850 F.2d 242, 245 (5th Cir.\n1988); Rink v. Commissioner, 47 F.3d 168, 171 (6th Cir. 1995); United States v. National\nSteel Corp., 75 F.3d 1146, 1150 (7th Cir. 1996). \u201cIt is a fundamental precept of the\ncommon law that the intention of the parties to a contract controls its interpretation.\u201d Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wis., 71 Fed. Cl. 641, 648 (2006); see Sid\nRichmond Carbon & Gasoline Co. v. Interenergy Resources, Ltd., 99 F.3d 746, 754 (5th\nCir. 1996); JAK Prods., Inc. v.

If the terms of a\ncontract are clear and unambiguous, courts do not consider extrinsic evidence in\ninterpreting the contract; extrinsic evidence is only allowed if the contract is ambiguous. See Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wis., 71 Fed. Cl. at 648; Rink, 47 F.3d at 172;\nS & O Liquidating Partnership v. Commissioner, 291 F.3d 454, 459 (7th Cir. 2002); cf.\nHall v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 937 F.2d 210, 214 (5th Cir. 1991). Under contract\nlaw, an interpretation that gives reasonable meaning to all parts of the contract is\npreferable to one that leaves portions of the contract meaningless. See Temple v.\nUnited States, 11 Ct. Cl. 302, 305 (1986); Rink, 47 F.3d at 171; Springer v.\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 2003-221.

For more information, see Pub. 596. Example. Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the\nfive tax benefits listed here based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s AGI is higher than yours and you don\u2019t claim J as a qualifying child, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 596. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. Social security number (SSN). For the EIC, a valid SSN is a\nnumber issued by the Social Security Administration unless\n\u201cNot Valid for Employment\u201d is printed on the social security\ncard and the number was issued solely to allow the recipient of\nthe SSN to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit. However, if \u201cValid for Work Only With DHS Authorization\u201d is printed on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC purposes only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid. To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number\n(SSN) near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't\nhave an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You\nCan't File on Time? If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of\nyour 2022 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC\non your original or an amended 2022 return. If a child didn't\nhave an SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (including extensions), you can't count that child as a qualifying\nchild in figuring the amount of the EIC on your original or an\namended 2022 return.

    "text": "--------------------------------. ------- POSTF-123043-08 8 under section 3401(c). 2. Employee Status for FICA Purposes\nA. 218 Agreement The question of whether the ------ members are covered by---------\u2019s Medicare-Only 218\nAgreement is relevant to your inquiry. Therefore, it must be determined whether an\nindividual worker is covered under a section 218 agreement. 8 The specific provisions\nof the agreements were negotiated by SSA and the State, and the State Social Security\nAdministrator traditionally has had jurisdiction over determining the scope and\napplication of the agreements. The terms used in the agreements are defined in the\nSocial Security Act and that statute contains the relevant statutory authority. Prior\ninterpretations of the agreements have been made by the State Social Security\nAdministrator and the State Administrator should have familiarity with (or have\nbackground files indicating) the intent of the agreements, and the amendments to the\nagreements. For these reasons, we believe the State Social Security Administrator has\njurisdiction over interpretations of section 218 agreements. Thus, in audits where interpretations of section 218 agreements are at issue, the\nService should contact the State Social Security Administrator to determine the State's\nand SSA's interpretation of whether an individual is covered under the agreement. The\nSocial Security Administrator determines whether the workers are employees within the\nmeaning of section 210(j) of the Social Security Act, which applies the common law\nrules. If the State Social Security Administrator determines that an individual worker is\ncovered under the section 218 agreement, the Service then has jurisdiction over the\ndetermination of the wages for FICA tax purposes and the liability for FICA taxes with\nrespect to remuneration paid to such individual. See I.R.C. section 3121(d)(4). If the\nState Social Security Administrator determines that an individual worker is not covered\nunder the section 218 agreement, the Service then determines whether the worker is an\nemployee under the common law rules. See I.R.C. section 3121(d)(2). If the worker is\nan employee under the common law rules, but not covered under the section 218\nagreement, then a determination needs to be made whether the individual is a \u201cmember\nof a retirement system.\u201d See section 3121(b)(7)(F) and section 31.3121(b)(7)-2 of the\nEmployment Tax Regulations. If the employee is not covered under the section 218\nagreement and is not a member of a retirement system, then remuneration for the\nservices of the employee is generally subject to the social security tax (i.e., the taxes\nimposed by sections 3101(a) and section 3111(a)) and the Medicare tax (i.e., the taxes\nimposed by section 3101(b) and section 3111(b)). Although it is our view that the determination of who is covered under the terms of a\nsection 218 agreement is under the jurisdiction of the State Social Security\nAdministrator and the Social Security Administration, the final determination of federal\n8 Section 218 refers to the Social Security Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 418. See I.R.C. sections\n3121(b)(7)(E) and 3121(d)(4) for treatment of individuals performing services covered by a section 218\nagreement as employees for FICA tax purposes. POSTF-123043-08 9 tax liability is under the jurisdiction of the Service. The enforcement mechanism with\nrespect to section 218 agreements is also with the Service because the payments under\nthe agreements are treated as FICA taxes.",
