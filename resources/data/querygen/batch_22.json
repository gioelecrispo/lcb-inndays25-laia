Page 25 of 37 POSTF-134629-07 Similar to taxpayer in Estate of Franklin, Corp F failed to provide any support for\nits conclusion that the $ DD purchase price was at least approximately equivalent to the\nfair market value of the assets sold. As stated by the Ninth Circuit, \u201c[i]n our view this\ndefect in the taxpayer\u2019s proof is fatal.\u201d 544 F.2d at 1048. See Wrenn v. Commissioner\n67 T.C. 576 (taxpayers not entitled to deferral benefits of \u00a7 453 because they did not\nestablish the transfer was a bona fide sale for tax purposes in substance as well as\nform). Thus, there is no sale for tax purposes; rather, Corp F continues, in substance, to\nown all the assets with all income of the business income of Corp F. Corp F used a\nmethod of accounting (installment method) that failed to clearly reflect its income from\nits business that it continued to run. While only the Year 13 is under audit, all deferred\nincome from Year 10-Year 12 can be included in Year 13 as set forth in Section 5,\nApplicability of \u00a7 481, below. The economic substance doctrine, applied above, disregards the transaction, i.e.,\nthere is no sale. The doctrine of substance over form recasts the transaction. As a first\nalternative, you should recast the transaction. Assuming arguendo the Z could be a\nsignificant expense reduction necessary to generate profits, the transaction would be\nrecast as Corp F and Entity M having entered into a partnership that failed to file any tax\nreturns, with Corp F the ** percent income partner and Entity M the ** percent income\npartner pursuant to the allocation of the \u201cProfit,\u201d and taxed accordingly. As a second\nalternative, you should assert Corp F and Entity M formed a C corporation, with the\nmirror stock plan and holder certificates representing the corporate shares. For that\nalternative, the corporation failed to file corporate tax returns, failed to pay the corporate\nlevel tax and failed to pay the shareholder level tax. 25 All ------------------------------------------------- would be dividends subject to a second level of tax, and should be taxed\naccordingly. As support for both the position that Corp F, in substance, retained ownership of\nthe assets and the positions that it formed new entities with Entity M, it is noted that\nCorp F provides the working capital to run the business. Entity M has no right to run the\nbusiness; rather, one of the owners of Corp F must be the CEO and Entity M must hire\nthe Corp F employees or Entity M is in default under the terms of the Note Agreement. Entity M cannot sell the assets it purportedly purchased and would, presumably, forfeit\nall assets back to Corp F in the event of a default. The default provisions are strict \u2013 in\nessence giving Corp F complete control.

No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number. You must enter each dependent's social security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered\nagree with the dependent's social security card.",

A copy of the October 20----memorandum is attached hereto as Exhibit A. POSTF-143023-10 12 ISSUES\n1) Whether the Coop\u2019s b payments to members and participating patrons for the\ntaxable year 20----constitute \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money\u201d within the\nmeaning of section 1382(b)(3) of the Code. Answer: The answer is no. This is\nbecause the b transactions are mutually agreed completed sale transactions\nbetween the Coop and its members or participating patrons. Neither the form or\nthe substance of the transaction nor any other collateral agreements provide\nevidence that the parties intended to treat the completed sales as PURPIMS, or\nas anything else other than completed sales. 2) Whether for the purpose of computing its section 199 domestic production\nactivities deduction, for the taxable year 20---, Coop\u2019s qualified production\nactivities income and taxable income should, pursuant to section 199 (d)(3)(C) of\nthe Code, be computed without regard to any deduction for b payments to\nmembers and participating patrons. In other words, whether all of Coop\u2019s b\npayments in cash to members and participating patrons for 20--- could be\nclassified as \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money\u201d and that they should be\nadded back in its section 199 computation. Answer: The answer is no. This is\nbecause based on the form and substance of the b transaction, the Coop\noriginally treated the b transactions as purchases (a part of their cost of goods\navailable for sale, and when sold to third party, deducted as cost of goods sold),\nand not as PURPIMS. Having failed to obtain a timely mutual agreement to\nreclassify the b purchases into PURPIMS, to allow an untimely reclassification\nwould be prejudicial to the members, patrons, and to tax administration. The\nharm to the members, participating patrons, and to tax administration supports\nholding the Coop to its original reported position under the doctrines of election,\nconsistency, and equitable principles, for the tax year 20---..\nDISCUSSION AND LEGAL ANALYSIS Summary of what this opinion holds. The Coop filed a claim for refund of overpaid taxes for their tax year ended\nDecember 31, 20---. The claimed overpayment is due to a recomputation of the Coop\u2019s\nI.R.C. \u00a7199 domestic production activities deduction. The recomputation consists of\nreclassifying b purchases from cooperative members and participating patrons into \u201cperunit retain allocations paid in money\u201d [(within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a71382(b)(3)]. This is\na unilateral and not a mutually agreed to reclassification. There is no evidence that the\nmembers and participating patrons in the b transactions agreed to this reclassification. 3\n3 Exhibit A, the October 20----memorandum from the Coop to its patrons, is simply a post claim for refund,\none-sided notification from the Coop to its patrons that they are receiving amended Forms 1099PATR. It\nneither expresses nor implies a mutual agreement by the Coop, its members, and participating patrons to\nreclassify b purchases into PURPIMS. The October 20--- memorandum is an untimely, self-serving\nunilateral action by the Coop. POSTF-143023-10 13",

Line 18\nPenalty on Early Withdrawal of\nSavings\nThe Form 1099-INT or Form 1099-OID\nyou received will show the amount of\nany penalty you were charged. -89- Line 19 a Line 19c On line 19c, enter the month and year of\nyour original divorce or separation\nagreement that relates to this deduction\nfor alimony paid. Line 20\nIRA Deduction If you made any nondeductible TIP contributions to a traditional\nindividual retirement arrangement (IRA) for 2022, you must report\nthem on Form 8606. You no longer need to be TIP younger than age 701/2 to take\na deduction for your contributions to an IRA. If you made contributions to a traditional IRA for 2022, you may be able to\ntake an IRA deduction. But you, or your\nspouse if filing a joint return, must have\nhad earned income to do so. For IRA\npurposes, earned income includes alimony and separate maintenance payments\nreported on Schedule 1, line 2a. If you\nwere a member of the U.S. Armed\nForces, earned income includes any nontaxable combat pay you received. If you\nwere self-employed, earned income is\ngenerally your net earnings from\nself-employment if your personal services were a material income-producing\nfactor. For more details, see Pub. 590-A. A statement should be sent to you by\nMay 31, 2023, that shows all contributions to your traditional IRA for 2022. Use the IRA Deduction Worksheet to\nfigure the amount, if any, of your IRA\ndeduction. But read the following list\nbefore you fill in the worksheet. 1. You can't deduct contributions to\na Roth IRA. But you may be able to take\nthe retirement savings contributions\ncredit (saver's credit). See the instructions for Schedule 3, line 4. 2. If you are filing a joint return and\nyou or your spouse made contributions\nto both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA\nfor 2022, don\u2019t use the IRA Deduction\nWorksheet in these instructions. Instead,\nsee Pub. 590-A to figure the amount, if\nany, of your IRA deduction. 3. You can\u2019t deduct elective deferrals to a 401(k) plan, 403(b) plan, section 457 plan, SIMPLE plan, or the federal Thrift Savings Plan. These amounts\naren't included as income in box 1 of\nyour Form W-2. 4. If you made contributions to your\nIRA in 2022 that you deducted for 2021,\ndon\u2019t include them in the worksheet. 5. If you received income from a\nnonqualified deferred compensation\nplan or nongovernmental section 457\nplan that is included in box 1 of your\nForm W-2, or in box 1 of Form\n1099-NEC, don\u2019t include that income on\nline 8 of the worksheet. The income\nshould be shown in (a) box 11 of your\nForm W-2, (b) box 12 of your Form\nW-2 with code Z, or (c) box 15 of Form 1099-MISC. If it isn't, contact your employer or the payer for the amount of the\nincome. 6. You must file a joint return to deduct contributions to your spouse's IRA. Enter the total IRA deduction for you\nand your spouse on line 20. 7. Don\u2019t include rollover contributions in figuring your deduction. Instead,\nsee the instructions for Form 1040 or\n1040-SR, lines 4a and 4b. 8. Don't include trustees' fees that\nwere billed separately and paid by you\nfor your IRA.",

All of the patrons' net margins shall, as received by the\nCooperative, belong to and be held for the patrons and shall be apportioned among\nthem on a patronage basis at the close of each fiscal year. Section 5 provides that allocation units may be used in determining how to apportion net\nsavings on a patronage basis. Coop uses a single allocation unit for b marketing\nbusiness, allocating patronage dividends on the basis of bushels of b marketed through\nCoop. Coop accounts for its b storage business in a separate allocation unit, allocating\npatronage dividends on the basis of storage fees paid to Coop. Coop currently uses\nthree allocation units for its supplies business \u2014 (i) merchandise and feed, (ii) fertilizer,\nchemical and seed, and (iii) petroleum. Each of the supplies allocation units allocates\npatronage dividends based upon dollars of purchases from Coop of products sold by\nthe unit. Section 6 requires the allocated amount be paid to patrons, but permits the Board to\npay a portion of the patronage dividend in written notices of allocation (referred to by\nCoop as \u201cMembers' Equity Credits\u201d). Article IX of Coop's By-laws provides that upon dissolution assets will first be used to\npay all debts and liabilities. Remaining assets will then be distributed to the holders of\nMembers' Equity Credits in an amount equal to the stated dollar amount of the Credits. The holders of capital stock and Certificates of Participation will then be entitled to\nreceive what they paid for them. Any residual assets then remaining will be shared on a\npatronage basis \u201camong the equity holders on the basis of their respective deferred\npatronage accounts as shown on the records of the cooperative insofar as possible.\u201d In the event that Coop incurs a loss, Section 7 of Article VIII authorizes Coop (among\nother things) to \u201ccharge such loss against the Members' Equity Credits and other equity\nheld by those stockholders and participating patrons whose patronage gave rise to such\nloss.\u201d This letter relates to Coop's b marketing activities. Coop operates *** b elevators located\nthroughout the territory it serves. Collectively, the elevators have the capacity to store\napproximately ----------------bushels of b. Coop's elevators located along rail lines tend to\nbe larger and to have more storage capacity than Coop's truck facilities. Most are\ncapable of loading 100-car trains used to ship b long distances to market. From the\nelevators, Coop is able to reach multiple domestic markets for b. From Coop's elevators\nserved by truck, b can be sold to local users. b from the truck elevators can also be\ntransferred to Coop's rail facilities for shipment by rail when the market dictates. POSTF-143023-10 7 In very simple terms, Coop's b marketing business on behalf of its members consists of\nbuying b from members and participating patrons, handling and storing the b at its\nelevators, and then selling the b to customers.",
