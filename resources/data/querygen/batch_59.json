See the instructions for Schedule 2, line 2, and the Instructions for\nForm 8962. You or whoever enrolled\nyou should have received Form 1095-A\nfrom the Marketplace with information\nabout who was covered and any advance\npayments of the premium tax credit. Innocent Spouse Relief\nGenerally, both you and your spouse are\neach responsible for paying the full\namount of tax, interest, and penalties on\nyour joint return. However, you may\nqualify for relief from liability for tax on\na joint return if (a) there is an understatement of tax because your spouse\nomitted income or claimed false deductions or credits; (b) you are divorced,\nseparated, or no longer living with your\nspouse; or (c) given all the facts and circumstances, it wouldn't be fair to hold\nyou liable for the tax. You may also\nqualify for relief if you were a married\nresident of a community property state\nbut didn't file a joint return and are now\nliable for an unpaid or understated tax. File Form 8857 to request relief. In\nsome cases, Form 8857 may need to be\nfiled within 2 years of the date on which\nthe IRS first attempted to collect the tax\nfrom you. Don\u2019t file Form 8857 with\nyour Form 1040 or 1040-SR. For more\ninformation, see Pub. 971 and Form\n8857, or you can call the Innocent\nSpouse office toll free at 855-851-2009. Income Tax Withholding\nand Estimated Tax\nPayments for 2023 If your SSN has been lost or stolen or\nyou suspect you are a victim of tax-related identity theft, visit IRS.gov/\nIdentityTheft to learn what steps you\nshould take. You can use the Tax\nTIP Withholding Estimator instead\nof Pub. 505 or the worksheets\nincluded with Form W-4 or W-4P to determine whether you need to have your\nwithholding increased or decreased. Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a systemic\nproblem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that haven't been resolved through normal channels, may be\neligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service\n(TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS\nby calling the National Taxpayer Advocate helpline at 877-777-4778. People\nwho are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a\nspeech disability and who have access to\nTTY/TDD\nequipment\ncan\ncall\n800-829-4059. Deaf or hard-of-hearing\nindividuals can also contact the IRS\nthrough Telecommunications Relay\nServices at FCC.gov/TRS. Protect yourself from suspicious\nemails or phishing schemes. Phishing\nis the creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business emails and websites. The most\ncommon form is sending an email to a\nuser falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to\nscam the user into surrendering private\ninformation that will be used for identity\ntheft. In general, you don\u2019t have to make\nestimated tax payments if you expect\nthat your 2023 Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nwill show a tax refund or a tax balance\ndue of less than $1,000.

(On a\njoint return, your spouse can also have a\nQCD of up to $100,000.) The amount of\nthe QCD is limited to the amount that would otherwise be included in your income. If your IRA includes nondeductible contributions, the distribution is first\nconsidered to be paid out of otherwise\ntaxable income. See Pub. 590-B for details. You can't claim a charitable\ncontribution deduction for any\nCAUTION QCD not included in your income. ! Exception 4. If all or part of the distribution is a health savings account (HSA)\nfunding distribution (HFD), enter the total distribution on line 4a. If the total\namount distributed is an HFD and you\nelect to exclude it from income, enter -0on line 4b. If only part of the distribution is an HFD and you elect to exclude\nthat part from income, enter the part that\nisn't an HFD on line 4b unless Exception\n2 applies to that part. Enter \u201cHFD\u201d next\nto line 4b. An HFD is a distribution made directly by the trustee of your IRA (other\nthan an ongoing SEP or SIMPLE IRA)\nto your HSA. If eligible, you can generally elect to exclude an HFD from your\nincome once in your lifetime. You can't\nexclude more than the limit on HSA\ncontributions or more than the amount\nthat would otherwise be included in your\nincome. If your IRA includes nondeductible contributions, the HFD is first considered to be paid out of otherwise taxable income. See Pub. 969 for details. The amount of an HFD reduces\nthe amount you can contribute\nCAUTION to your HSA for the year. If you\nfail to maintain eligibility for an HSA\nfor the 12 months following the month of\nthe HFD, you may have to report the\nHFD as income and pay an additional\ntax. See Form 8889, Part III. ! More than one exception applies. If\nmore than one exception applies, include\na statement showing the amount of each\nexception, instead of making an entry\nnext to line 4b. For example: \u201cLine 4b \u2013\n$1,000 Rollover and $500 HFD.\u201d But\nyou do not need to attach a statement if\nonly Exception 2 and one other exception apply. More than one distribution. If you (or\nyour spouse if filing jointly) received\nmore than one distribution, figure the\ntaxable amount of each distribution and -27- enter the total of the taxable amounts on\nline 4b. Enter the total amount of those\ndistributions on line 4a. You may have to pay an additional tax if you received an\nCAUTION early distribution from your\nIRA and the total wasn't rolled over. See\nthe instructions for Schedule 2, line 8,\nfor details. ! More information. For more information about IRAs, see Pub. 590-A and\nPub. 590-B.

The second distortion occurred at the other end of the patent term. In 1984, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided that\nthe manufacture, use, or sale of a patented invention during the\nterm of the patent constituted an act of infringement, see 35 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 271(a), even if it was for the sole purpose of conducting tests and\ndeveloping information necessary to apply for regulatory approval. Since that activity could not be commenced by those who planned\nto compete with the patentee until expiration of the entire patent\nterm, the patentee's de facto monopoly would continue for an often\nsubstantial period until regulatory approval was obtained. In other\nwords, the combined effect of the patent law and the premarket\nregulatory approval requirement was to create an effective\nextension of the patent term. The 1984 Act sought to eliminate this distortion from both ends of\nthe patent period. Section 201 of the Act established a patent-term\nextension for patents relating to certain products that were subject 54 More specifically, \u201c[t]o obtain FDA approval, a generic manufacturer must ordinarily show, among other\nthings, that its product has the same active ingredients as an approved brand-name drug; that \u2018the route\nof administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the new drug are the same\u2019 as the brand-name\ndrug; and that its product is \u2018bioequivalent\u2019 to the brand-name drug.

By eliminating the need for generic manufacturers to prove their drugs\u2019 safety and efficacy independently,\nthe Hatch-Waxman Amendments allow generic manufacturers to bring drugs to market much less\nexpensively.\u201d Pliva v.

[a section] establishing that \u201cit shall not be an act\nof infringement to make, use, or sell a patented invention ... solely\nfor uses reasonably related to the development and submission of\ninformation under a Federal law which regulates the manufacture,\nuse, or sale of drugs.\u201d This allows competitors, prior to the\nexpiration of a patent, to engage in otherwise infringing activities\nnecessary to obtain regulatory approval. 469 U.S. at 669-71 (citations and footnotes omitted). Thus, while prior to the Hatch-Waxman Act non-authorized generic equivalents of\npatented drugs could not be developed without infringing the patents that covered the\ndrug,55 under the 1984 revisions the unauthorized use of a patented drug for the\npurposes of developing a generic drug no longer constitutes an act of infringement. 56\n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2010).

    "text": "\"Cost-plus\" -- TAM 9803003. As noted above, the original version of section\n833 only referred to \"claims incurred\" and did not include the language \"liabilities\nincurred . . . under cost-plus contracts.\" The Protest notes that \"examining agents\ninterpreted the term 'claims incurred' to include only claims incurred under insurance\npolicies,\" referring to a case pending \"shortly before the 1997 Relief Act.\" Protest, page\n15. It is probably more accurate to say that agents interpreted the term \"claims\nincurred\" to refer to claims under insured arrangements, since the phrase \"claims\nincurred\" in the health insurance industry is the equivalent of \"losses incurred\" for\nproperty and casualty insurers. In general, the NAIC is only concerned with insurance\nactivities. Insurers are only required to maintain loss reserves with respect to insurance\ntransactions. Accordingly, the statute's use of the phrase \"claims incurred\" implies\ninsured transactions, since that is the phrase used in the insurance industry for\ntransactions that are treated as insured transactions on the NAIC Annual Statement. The phrase \"claims incurred\" is not a broad generic term that includes claims of any\nkind. It should be noted that during this same time period -- shortly before the 1997\nRelief Act -- the NAIC was considering \"guidance on the recording and reporting of\ntransactions related to uninsured plans.\" (SIP 47.) To the extent the NAIC was\nconsidering excluding such transactions from Annual Statement reserves, it would be POSTU-144536-09 22 reasonable to conclude that such items should not be included in the section 833(b)\nspecial deduction. If an item was not considered a \"claim incurred\" for Annual\nStatement purposes, it should not be considered a \"claim incurred\" for purposes of\nsection 833(b). As the Protest points out, section 833 was amended in 1997, retroactively, to\ninclude the phrase \"liabilities incurred . . . under cost-plus contracts.\" See Taxpayer\nRelief Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105-334, section 1604 (August 5, 1997). Shortly thereafter,\nas the Protest points out, the IRS issued a Technical Advice Memorandum concluding\nthat \"cost-plus\" contracts are included in claims incurred under section 833(b)(1)(A)(i). TAM 9803003 (September 26, 1997). Technical Advice Memoranda are not precedent, I.R.C. \u00a7 6110(k)(3), although\ncourts have noted that they \"do reveal the interpretation put upon the statute by the\nagency charged with the responsibility of administering the revenue laws.\u201d Hanover\nBank v. Commissioner , 369 U.S. 672, 686 (1962). See Rowan Cos. v. United States,\n452 U.S. 247, 261 n.17 (1981); Estate of Cristofani v. Commissioner, 97 T.C. 74, 84 n.5\n(1991). A request for technical advice involves both the IRS and the taxpayer and the\ntaxpayer has input into the facts presented in the request. See Rev. Proc. 97-2, 1997-1\nC.B. 486, Section 8. Accordingly, while the TAM cited by the Taxpayer in the present\ncase may not be cited as legal precedent, the facts recited in the TAM are an indication\nof the type of transactions that were considered \"cost-plus\" by BCBS organizations at\nthe time of the amendment of section 833. The Protest does not quote the TAM.",

Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule\n3, line 2). 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part\nIII). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number. You must enter each dependent's social security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered\nagree with the dependent's social security card.",

How Long Should\nRecords Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items\nappearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and\n1099) until the statute of limitations runs\nout for that return. Usually, this is 3\nyears from the date the return was due or\nfiled or 2 years from the date the tax was\npaid, whichever is later. You should\nkeep some records longer. For example,\nkeep property records (including those\non your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or\nreplacement property. For more details,\nsee chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return\nFile Form 1040-X to change a return\nyou already filed. Generally, Form\n1040-X must be filed within 3 years af- ter the date the original return was filed\nor within 2 years after the date the tax\nwas paid, whichever is later. But you\nmay have more time to file Form\n1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically\nor mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. Use the Where's My Amended Return\napplication on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return. It can take\nup to 3 weeks from the date you mailed\nit to show up in our system. Need a Copy of Your\nTax Return Information?

A personal representative can be an executor, administrator, or anyone who is in charge\nof the deceased taxpayer's property. If\nthe deceased taxpayer didn't have to file\na return but had tax withheld, a return\nmust be filed to get a refund. The person\nwho files the return must enter \u201cDeceased,\u201d the deceased taxpayer's name,\nand the date of death across the top of\nthe return.

    "text": "The Arrowsmith doctrine ultimately is premised\non the idea that, if the transactions are sufficiently related, the tax consequences should\nbe the same as if the prior and the subsequent transactions had occurred at the same\ntime. Seagate Technology, Inc. v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 2000-361, 80 T.C.M.\n(CCH) 759, 763 (2000). The question of what is related to a tax-free spinoff is not addressed by the\nCode, apart from the specific rules in sections 351, 355, and 368, which state, in\nessence, that the actual distribution of stock to shareholders in this type of spinoff is taxfree. \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D). The Service routinely addresses ancillary issues in private letter\nrulings, none of which can be cited as precedent, because the facts differ from taxpayer\nto taxpayer. We are not aware of any cases, rulings, or other published advice in which\na court or the Service has ruled that these types of post-spinoff payments relate back to\nthe tax-free transaction. The reimbursements X received from Z are not sufficiently related to the tax-free\nspinoff so as to be excluded from X\u2019s income. The mere contemporaneous execution of\nthe spinoff transaction and employee assignment agreement is not enough to make the\ntwo integrally related for tax purposes. The purpose of the employee assignment\nagreement appears to be more closely tied to obtaining the union\u2019s approval for the\nspinoff, rather than integrally related to the spinoff transaction itself. In Arrowsmith, the\nliability was not fixed and ascertainable until after the corporate liquidation, but the\nliability for the judgment had arisen, or was directly related to, an event that occurred POSTF-100602-09 11 before the liquidation. Arrowsmith, 344 U.S. at 7-8. In cases in which the courts have\nrefused to apply the Arrowsmith doctrine, the two transactions were, in all economic\nreality, two separate, independent events. See, e.g., Seagate Technology, T.C. Memo\n2000-361, at *23. Here, X and Z were not required, by sections 351, 355, or 368, to\nenter into the employee assignment agreement in order to effectuate the spinoff, and, in\nany event, none of those provisions (or related provisions) would grant non-recognition\ntreatment to payments received by X under the agreement. X and Z entered into the\nemployee assignment agreement in large part because the CBA required it. The\nemployee assignment agreement was merely an executory agreement about the\nparties\u2019 future dealings regarding employees. Therefore, because X has failed to show\nthat the reimbursements are part and parcel of the tax-free spinoff of Z, X must include\nthe reimbursements in income when received. The Tax Sharing Agreement and the Danielson Rule In their tax sharing agreement, X and Z expressly agreed that X would recognize\nthe reimbursements as income and simultaneously deduct as compensation expenses\nthe amounts it was paying its employees assigned to Z; Z was to treat the\nreimbursements consistent with X\u2019s treatment. X now seeks to effectively repudiate this\nportion of the tax sharing agreement, without any apparent regard to the effects such a\nretroactive act would have on Z. Z has not had any opportunity to present its views\nregarding the correctness of the applicable section of the tax sharing agreement.",

    "text": "I.R.C. \u00a7199. These members and\nparticipating patrons would have reported their b sales, per-unit retains paid in money,\nin different lines of Schedule F (Form 1040) and computed their own Domestic\nProduction Activities Deduction (DPAD) in their own Form 8903, based on what to them\nwere completed sales of b. To re-characterize the b purchases into per-unit retains\nwould place them in the position of having erroneously reported their income tax for the\n20--- tax year and destroy their contractual agreements and expectations, without their\nassent to this modification; and, all of this would be simply be done to allow the Coop to\nobtain a higher domestic production deduction;\nFifth, (unlike the situation of the Coop, assuming that its 20--- year has been kept open\nby a timely claim for refund), for almost all the members (or participating patrons), the\ntaxable year 20--- is now be a closed year (assuming no extensions of the statute); Consequently, a reclassification of the members and participating patrons\u2019 b sales to\nper-unit retains would require them to recalculate their individual section 199 domestic\nproduction deduction; Sixth, the recalculation of the members and participating patrons own section 199\ndomestic production deduction, [by forcing them to exclude b sales from their individual\nQPAI computations, which they had every right to believe belonged to them], would\nreduce their individual section 199 domestic production deductions; Seventh, whether this section 199 reduction would be counterbalanced by a passthrough of the Coop\u2019s own section 199 is doubtful and speculative for two reasons: One,\na cooperative must designate the patron\u2019s portion of the income allocable to QPAI in a\nwritten notice mailed by the cooperative to the patron no later than the fifteenth day of\nthe ninth month following the close of the tax year. I.R.C. \u00a7199(d)(3)(A)(ii); and, Two,\nThe Coop can elect or not elect to pass through to its members or participating patrons\n(as the Coop is not required to pass thru) the section 199 domestic production\ndeduction;\nEighth, to allow the b payment re-characterization is prejudicial, detrimental, and\nconfusing, and inequitable, without prior member or participating patron agreement. It\ndenies the members and patrons the benefit of their contractual right and expectation to\nconsider the b payments as their own sale proceeds; Ninth, tax administration is also negatively impacted as the Service has relied on the\nform, substance, continuing course of conduct, and intention of the Coop, its members\nand participating patrons, with respect the b sale/purchase agreements. The statute of\nlimitations for making assessments against these member and participating patrons, for\nthe taxable year 20--- has, in most cases, expired; POSTF-143023-10 27 Tenth, even at the present time, there is no evidence that the Coop, its members and\nparticipating patrons have mutually rescinded the closed b purchased contracts (oral or\nwritten) and substituted a per-unit retain understanding between the parties, with\nrespect to the b transactions; The only evidence of the intention to reclassify is ex post\nfacto and one-sided, namely, the Coop\u2019s claim for refund and the Coop\u2019s unilateral\nOctober 20--- memorandum announcing to its patrons that it is amending its 20----Forms 1099-PATR (among others); Eleventh, the doctrine of election precludes the retroactive re-characterization of the b\npayments.",
