(UIL 861.09-00)\nConclusion In apportioning a partner\u2019s non-partnership-incurred\ninterest expense under the FMV method, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.8619T(e)(2), in tandem with Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii),\nrequires a greater-than-10-percent corporate partner to look\nthrough and take into account its proportionate share of the\ngross assets of the partnership. Facts\nTAXPAYER is F, operating over G in the United States and\nserving H American customers in parts of I states. Its service\nterritory covers J square miles in K. TAXPAYER=s U.S. customers\nare served by one of the world=s largest L systems, consisting of\nM and N. TAXPAYER's asset base also includes O, and more. In Year 1, A, one of TAXPAYER\u2019s wholly owned domestic\nsubsidiaries, acquired a P interest in B (\"B\"), an R corporation. The other P interest in B was owned by E, an entity unrelated to\nTAXPAYER. B, in turn, owned two R holding companies that\nultimately owned the stock of several R operating companies that\nproduce and sell Q in R. As is relevant here, during Year 1,\nTAXPAYER elected to have B treated as a partnership pursuant to\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7701-3. We are unaware of any reason why the\nelection to be treated as a partnership was not effective for CC:LM:HMT:CIN:1:POSTF-168001-03 Page 3 purposes of TAXPAYER\u2019s Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 consolidated\nfederal income tax returns. TAXPAYER\u2019s Year 1 through Year 3 tax years are currently\nunder audit by LMSB Examination. For those years, TAXPAYER\nclaimed foreign tax credits (FTC) in the amounts of Amount $A,\nAmount $B and Amount $C, respectively. For each year, the\nTAXPAYER attached a Form 1118, computing its allowable FTC, to\nits consolidated federal income tax return. Schedule H, Part II\nof the Form 1118 allows the computation of the interest expense\napportionment and contains the election to use either the fair\nmarket value or tax book value method of apportionment. TAXPAYER\nelected the fair market value (the \u201cFMV\u201d) method for each of the\nyears Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3.1 For purposes of the required allocation and apportionment of\ninterest expense under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T, TAXPAYER recorded\nthe amounts of Amount $D, Amount $E, and Amount $F as the fair\nmarket value of its interest in B for the tax years Year 1, Year\n2, and Year 3, respectively.",

    "text": "Foreign financial assets. If you had\nforeign financial assets in 2022, you\nmay have to file Form 8938. See Form\n8938 and its instructions. Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nCases If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case, income taxable to the bankruptcy estate and reported on the estate's\nincome tax return includes:\n\u2022 Earnings from services you performed after the beginning of the case\n(both wages and self-employment income); and\n\u2022 Income from property described in\nsection 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code\nthat you either owned when the case began or that you acquired after the case\nbegan and before the case was closed,\ndismissed, or converted to a case under a\ndifferent chapter. Because this income is taxable to the\nestate, don\u2019t include this income on your\n-23- own individual income tax return. The\nonly exception is for purposes of figuring your self-employment tax. For that\npurpose, you must take into account all\nyour self-employment income for the\nyear from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is appointed) must allocate between you and\nthe bankruptcy estate the wages, salary,\nor other compensation and withheld income tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for income and withheld income tax reported\nto you on Forms 1099. You must also\ninclude a statement that indicates you\nfiled a chapter 11 case and that explains\nhow income and withheld income tax reported to you on Forms W-2 and 1099\nare allocated between you and the estate. For more details, including acceptable\nallocation methods, see Notice 2006-83,\n2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at\nIRS.gov/irb/\n2006-40_IRB#NOT-2006-83. Community Property States\nCommunity property states include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington,\nand Wisconsin. If you and your spouse\nlived in a community property state, you\nmust usually follow state law to determine what is community income and\nwhat is separate income. For details, see\nForm 8958 and Pub. 555. Nevada, Washington, and California\ndomestic partners. A registered domestic partner in Nevada, Washington,\nor California must generally report half\nthe combined community income of the\nindividual and their domestic partner. See Form 8958 and Pub. 555. Rounding Off to Whole\nDollars You can round off cents to whole dollars\non your return and schedules. If you do\nround to whole dollars, you must round\nall amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from\n50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more\namounts to figure the amount to enter on\na line, include cents when adding the\namounts and round off only the total. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. If you are entering amounts that include cents, make sure to include the\ndecimal point. There is no cents column\non the form. The lines on Forms 1040 and\n1040-SR are the same. ReferenCAUTION ces to lines in the following instructions refer to the line on either\nform. ! Line 1a\nTotal Amount From Form(s)\nW-2, Box 1\nEnter the total amount from Form(s)\nW-2, box 1. If a joint return, also include your spouse's income from\nForm(s) W-2, box 1.",

    "text": "Id. We disagree that Arrowsmith applies here. In general, Arrowsmith governs\ncases where a subsequent, unknown or unexpected event occurs, and the proper tax\ntreatment of that event can be determined only after reference to an earlier transaction. In contrast, in this case there is no subsequent event whose tax treatment is related to\nthe integrated steps of the spin-off transaction. Although X and Z entered into the\nemployee assignment agreement in connection with the spin-off, the terms of that\nexecutory agreement fully determine the proper tax treatment of payments under the POSTF-100602-09 9 agreement. However, to the extent Arrowsmith governs X\u2019s refund claim, we disagree\nthat X is entitled to the outcome it seeks. The Court\u2019s analysis in Arrowsmith is not a simple \u201cbut . . . for\u201d test; X must show\nan integral relationship between the tax-free spinoff and the employee assignment\nreimbursements. Arrowsmith does not only stand for the proposition that a prior year\n(or event) may be relevant in determining the character of a gain or loss in a\nsubsequent year; it also supports the rationale that, \u201cif money was taxed at a special\nlower rate when received, the taxpayer would be accorded an unfair tax windfall if\nrepayments were generally deductible from receipts taxable at the higher rate\napplicable to ordinary income.\u201d United States v. Skelly Oil Co., 394 U.S. 678, 684-85\n(1969). In Mitchell v. Commissioner, for example, the court held that the character of a\ntaxpayer\u2019s repayment was governed by an earlier transaction because of the \u201cintegral\nrelationship\u201d between the two. 428 F.2d 259, 263 (6th Cir. 1970). Courts have not provided a bright line test in these types of cases; rather, the\n\u201cintegral relationship\u201d is determined on a case-by-case basis. In Arrowsmith, the loss\nattributable to the judgment was closely related to the capital corporate liquidation\u2014the\njudgment, although it occurred after liquidation, was considered pre-liquidation because\nit was against the corporation, not its individual shareholders. 344 U.S. at 8. In Skelly\nOil, the amount of the deduction in the later year was determined with reference to the\nearlier depletion allowance because the taxpayer otherwise would have made a profit\nequivalent to the taxes on the allowance. 394 U.S. at 686. Finally, in Mitchell, as well\nas a line of similar cases, the character of the taxpayer\u2019s repayment of short-swing profit\non a stock sale was capital because the repayment grew out of the original stock sale. POSTF-100602-09 10 428 F.2d at 264. These cases illustrate that a careful, in-depth knowledge of the facts\nand circumstances of both the original and subsequent transactions is required to\ndetermine if they are integrally related. The Arrowsmith doctrine ultimately is premised\non the idea that, if the transactions are sufficiently related, the tax consequences should\nbe the same as if the prior and the subsequent transactions had occurred at the same\ntime.

    "text": "In the Holsey case, the redemption was for less than book\nvalue of the stock redeemed. By such discount, the continuing shareholders benefitted\nbecause their stock value consequently increased. Nevertheless, the court determined\nthat the purchase of a stock-holder's shares by the corporation at an option price below\nbook value did not effect a dividend distribution to the remaining shareholder. Holsey at\n868. With respect to the differential resulting in increased value to the remaining\nshareholder, the Court cited the analogy initially proposed by the Schmitt court where a\nparcel of land appreciates in value over time, but no taxable event occurs. Similarly as\nto stock, although the value increases, this accre-tion does not give rise to taxable\nincome within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment until the corporation makes a POSTF-106186-02 11 distribu-tion to the stockholder or his stock is sold. Holsey at 868. The Tax Court in the\nWilliams case specifically pointed-out as significant that the Holsey court determined no\nconstructive dividend arose despite that the option price for the redemption was less\nthan the market value of the redeemed shares. Williams at 1677 n.3. While in Rev. Rul. 58-614, the IRS announced that it would follow the decision of\nHolsey, the Service went on, however, to caution that regardless of the form of the\ntransaction, if the stock was in reality purchased by the remaining shareholders and\npaid for by the corporation, the payment would be considered a dividend to the\nremaining shareholders. If, as the Stock Sale Agreement seems to permit, one or more of the continuing\nshareholders acquired the shares of the dece-dent using the life insurance proceeds,\nconstructive dividends would arise. We discern this ability since the Stock Sale Agreement fails to specifically prohibit such action. The agreement states, \"Any excess of\ninsurance proceeds over the purchase price shall be retained by the purchaser of the\ncommon shares, free and clear of any obligations under this Agreement.\" \"Purchaser\"\nis undefined in the agreement, although the only parties authorized to purchase are the\ncontinuing shareholders, who possess an election to purchase, and the trustee who has\nan obligation to purchase any shares not earlier purchased. It is unlikely that the continuing shareholders would pur-chase the shares since\nthe continuing shareholders can achieve the same ownership increase by merely\nhaving the corporation redeem the decedent's shares. Similarly, the competing\ninterests of the continuing shareholders would seem to preclude less than all of the\ncontinuing shareholders from attempting to purchase the shares using the insurance\nproceeds. In this case, the potential corporate redemption causes no constructive dividend\nto occur to the continuing shareholders since they are not relieved of any obligation to\npurchase the decedent's shares. Unless the shareholders personally avail themselves\nof the life insurance proceeds, the authorities reflect that no constructive dividend would\noccur at the redemp-tion. That being the case, we do not foresee the Service pre-vailing on an argument\nthat a portion of each life insurance premium payment on any one shareholder's life\nconstitutes a constructive dividend to the other shareholders. Finally, we reiterate another caution contained in Rev. Rul. 58-164.",
