In the\ncase of the September 11 attacks, injuries eligible for coverage by the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund are\ntreated as incurred as a direct result of\nthe attack. If these payments are incorrectly reported as taxable on Form\nSSA-1099, don't include the nontaxable\nportion of income on your tax return. You may receive a notice from the IRS\nregarding the omitted payments. Follow\nthe instructions in the notice to explain\nthat the excluded payments aren't taxable. For more information about these\npayments, see Pub. 3920. Example. Taxpayer X, a firefighter,\nwas disabled as a direct result of the\nSeptember 11 terrorist attack on the\nWorld Trade Center.

In the year X turned 66, X received\n$1,500 per month in benefits from the\nSocial Security Administration (for a total of $18,000). Because X became eligible for a full retirement benefit in May,\nthe month after X turned 66, X can exclude only four months (January through\nApril) of their annual benefit from their\nincome ($6,000).",

    "text": "Taxpayer also argues that LLC\u2019s productive capacity would have been relevant for\npurposes of applying the productive capacity limitation to Taxpayer only if LLC had been\nan eligible small ethanol producer and had made an allocation of the small ethanol\nproducer credit to Taxpayer. It is true that if LLC was an eligible small ethanol producer\nand had made an allocation of the small ethanol producer credit to Taxpayer, it would\nhave been necessary for Taxpayer to apply the productive capacity limitation at the LLC\nmember level under the pass-through entity rule in \u00a7 40(g)(3) in order to determine\nwhether Taxpayer qualified for the credit. However, contrary to Taxpayer\u2019s position, the\napplication of the productive capacity limitation under \u00a7 40(g)(1) and the aggregation\nrule in \u00a7 40(g)(2) is not limited to persons that satisfy the productive capacity limitation\nwhen considered in isolation of other related entities. POSTU-121455-09 8 Taxpayer\u2019s alternative argument is that, if it is necessary to consider LLC\u2019s productive\ncapacity for purposes of applying the productive capacity limitation to Taxpayer, the\npass-through entity rule in \u00a7 40(g)(3) requires applying the productive capacity limitation\nat the partner or similar level, in which case LLC\u2019s productive capacity would be\nallocated through Taxpayer to Taxpayer\u2019s patrons and the productive capacity limitation\nwould be tested at the patron level. Given that Taxpayer had a large number of patrons\nbetween Date 1 and Date 9, Taxpayer argues that the productive capacity limitation\nwould not have been exceeded based on each patron\u2019s pro rata share of Taxpayer\u2019s\npro rata share of LLC\u2019s productive capacity. Taxpayer argues that because the\nproductive capacity limitation was satisfied at the patron level, Taxpayer was an eligible\nsmall ethanol producer. Under Taxpayer\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 40(g)(3), the productive capacity limitation applies\nat the partner or similar level to determine whether a pass-through entity satisfies the\nproductive capacity limitation. Contrary to Taxpayer\u2019s position, the productive capacity\nlimitation is applied at the partner or similar level to determine whether an owner of a\npass-through entity qualifies for the small ethanol producer credit if the owner receives\nan allocation of the credit from one or more pass-through entities. The application of the partner or similar level rule in \u00a7 40(g)(3) does not apply in this\ncase because Taxpayer was not an eligible small ethanol producer under the productive\ncapacity limitation under \u00a7 40(g)(1) and the aggregation rule under \u00a7 40(g)(2) during the\nentire taxable year ending Date 9. Once Taxpayer exceeds the production capacity\nlimitations, no further inquiry is required regarding the production capacity of Taxpayer\u2019s\npatrons since the credit is not available at this point. SUMMARY\nTaxpayer and LLC were considered to be one person during the period Date 3 through\nDate 7 pursuant to the aggregation rule in \u00a7 40(g)(2) because of Taxpayer\u2019s ownership\nof more than 50% of the LLC capital interest and profit interest during such period. During the period commencing on Date 6, Taxpayer and LLC were considered to have\ncombined productive capacity of J gallons, which exceeded the 60 million gallon\nlimitation in \u00a7 40(g)(1).",

    "text": "Low Income Taxpayer Clinics Help Taxpayers\nLow Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Taxpayer Advocate\nService (TAS). LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with\nthe IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition,\nLITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak\nEnglish as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, see\nthe LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate. IRS.gov/LITCMap or IRS Publication 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic List. This\npublication is available online at IRS. gov/Forms-Pubs or by calling the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). Suggestions for Improving the IRS\nTaxpayer Advocacy Panel\nTaxpayers have an opportunity to provide direct feedback to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) through the Taxpayer Advocacy\nPanel (TAP). The TAP is a Federal Advisory Committee comprised of an independent panel of citizen volunteers who listen to\ntaxpayers, identify taxpayers' systemic issues, and make suggestions for improving IRS customer service. Contact TAP at\nImproveIRS.org. -4- Affordable Care Act \u2014 What You Need To Know\nRequirement To Reconcile Advance Payments of the Premium Tax Credit The premium tax credit helps pay premiums for health insurance purchased from the Marketplace. Eligible\nindividuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance\ncompany. If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the\npremium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach\nForm 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year. The Marketplace is required to send Form 1095-A by January 31, 2023, listing the advance payments and other\ninformation you need to complete Form 8962. 1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace. 2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments. 3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR. (Don\u2019t include Form 1095-A.) Health Coverage Reporting If you or someone in your family was an employee in 2022, the employer may be required to send you Form\n1095-C. Part II of Form 1095-C shows whether your employer offered you health insurance coverage and, if\nso, information about the offer. You should receive Form 1095-C by early March 2023. This information may be\nrelevant if you purchased health insurance coverage for 2022 through the Health Insurance Marketplace and\nwish to claim the premium tax credit on Schedule 3, line 9. However, you don\u2019t need to wait to receive this form\nto file your return. You may rely on other information received from your employer. If you don\u2019t wish to claim the\npremium tax credit for 2022, you don\u2019t need the information in Part II of Form 1095-C.",

    "text": "Low Income Taxpayer Clinics Help Taxpayers\nLow Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Taxpayer Advocate\nService (TAS). LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with\nthe IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition,\nLITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak\nEnglish as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, see\nthe LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate. IRS.gov/LITCMap or IRS Publication 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic List. This\npublication is available online at IRS. gov/Forms-Pubs or by calling the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). Suggestions for Improving the IRS\nTaxpayer Advocacy Panel\nTaxpayers have an opportunity to provide direct feedback to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) through the Taxpayer Advocacy\nPanel (TAP). The TAP is a Federal Advisory Committee comprised of an independent panel of citizen volunteers who listen to\ntaxpayers, identify taxpayers' systemic issues, and make suggestions for improving IRS customer service. Contact TAP at\nImproveIRS.org. -4- Affordable Care Act \u2014 What You Need To Know\nRequirement To Reconcile Advance Payments of the Premium Tax Credit The premium tax credit helps pay premiums for health insurance purchased from the Marketplace. Eligible\nindividuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance\ncompany. If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the\npremium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach\nForm 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year. The Marketplace is required to send Form 1095-A by January 31, 2023, listing the advance payments and other\ninformation you need to complete Form 8962. 1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace. 2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments. 3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR. (Don\u2019t include Form 1095-A.) Health Coverage Reporting If you or someone in your family was an employee in 2022, the employer may be required to send you Form\n1095-C. Part II of Form 1095-C shows whether your employer offered you health insurance coverage and, if\nso, information about the offer. You should receive Form 1095-C by early March 2023. This information may be\nrelevant if you purchased health insurance coverage for 2022 through the Health Insurance Marketplace and\nwish to claim the premium tax credit on Schedule 3, line 9. However, you don\u2019t need to wait to receive this form\nto file your return. You may rely on other information received from your employer. If you don\u2019t wish to claim the\npremium tax credit for 2022, you don\u2019t need the information in Part II of Form 1095-C.",
