See the instructions for Schedule 2, line 2, and the Instructions for\nForm 8962. You or whoever enrolled\nyou should have received Form 1095-A\nfrom the Marketplace with information\nabout who was covered and any advance\npayments of the premium tax credit. Innocent Spouse Relief\nGenerally, both you and your spouse are\neach responsible for paying the full\namount of tax, interest, and penalties on\nyour joint return. However, you may\nqualify for relief from liability for tax on\na joint return if (a) there is an understatement of tax because your spouse\nomitted income or claimed false deductions or credits; (b) you are divorced,\nseparated, or no longer living with your\nspouse; or (c) given all the facts and circumstances, it wouldn't be fair to hold\nyou liable for the tax. You may also\nqualify for relief if you were a married\nresident of a community property state\nbut didn't file a joint return and are now\nliable for an unpaid or understated tax. File Form 8857 to request relief. In\nsome cases, Form 8857 may need to be\nfiled within 2 years of the date on which\nthe IRS first attempted to collect the tax\nfrom you. Don\u2019t file Form 8857 with\nyour Form 1040 or 1040-SR. For more\ninformation, see Pub. 971 and Form\n8857, or you can call the Innocent\nSpouse office toll free at 855-851-2009.

You can reach TAS\nby calling the National Taxpayer Advocate helpline at 877-777-4778.

Phishing\nis the creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business emails and websites. The most\ncommon form is sending an email to a\nuser falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to\nscam the user into surrendering private\ninformation that will be used for identity\ntheft.

The regulations did not reverse the norm of capitalization; the subset of\nexpenditures that are not within the regulations is limited given the breadth and depth of the regulations. Moreover, the preamble to the 2004 capitalization of intangible regulations clearly states that \u201c[t]he IRS\nand Treasury Department intend to construe broadly the categories of intangibles identified in the\nregulations in response to any narrow technical arguments that an intangible created by the taxpayer is\nnot literally described in the categories.\u201c T.D. 9107, 2004-1 C.B. 447 \u00a7 II. D. Created Intangibles. POSTU-139175-10 32 defending a divorce suit was a nondeductible personal expense,\neven though the outcome of the divorce case would affect the\ntaxpayer's property holdings, and might affect his business\nreputation. The Court rejected a test that looked to the\nconsequences of the litigation, and did not even consider the\ntaxpayer's motives or purposes in undertaking defense of the\nlitigation, but rather examined the origin and character of the claim\nagainst the taxpayer, and found that the claim arose out of the\npersonal relationship of marriage. 397 U.S. at 578 (1970) (emphasis added). In accord, United States v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 397 U.S. 580, 583 (1970) (\u201cAs we held\nin Woodward, supra, the expenses of litigation that arise out of the acquisition of a\ncapital asset are capital expenses, quite apart from whether the taxpayer\u2019s purpose in\nincurring them is the defense or perfection of title to property.\u201d); McKeague v. United\nStates, 12 Cl. Ct. 671, 675 (1987) aff\u2019d without published opinion, 852 F.2d 1294 (Fed.\nCir. 1988) (the objective in the origin of the claim test is \u201cto find the transaction or\nactivity from which the taxable event approximately resulted\u201d); American Stores v.\nCommissioner, 114 T.C. 458, 470 (2000)(reiterates that the primary purpose test has\nbeen rejected, and states the \u201cnature of the transaction out of which the expenditure in\ncontroversy arose governs \u2026 regardless of the motives\u201d); Anchor Coupling v. United\nStates, 427 F.2d 429, 434 (7th Cir. 1970)(rejected primary purpose test in favor of the\norigin of the claim test for settlements); Keller Street Development Company v.\nCommissioner, 688 F. 2d 675, 678, 680 (9th Cir. 1982)(the origin of the claim is not\n\u201cbased on the consequences to the taxpayer\u201d and does not look to the primary\npurpose). In general, the above cases establish that, in applying the origin of the claim test, the\npurpose, consequence, or result is irrelevant. The origin of the claim test is an objective\ninquiry to determine the origin and character of the claim from which the litigation\nproximately resulted, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances; it is not a\ntest dependent on the formal titles to pleadings or subjective motives. The intangible\nregulations, Treas. Reg. \u00a71.263(a)-4, also provide that determinations of whether to\ncapitalize should be made taking into account all of the facts and circumstances,\ndisregarding distinctions between labels.

Memo. 1976-140, 35 T.C.M. 627, 635. Authorities have been uncovered whereby the Service has successfully\nchallenged purported redemption payments and found them to be taxable to the\nredeeming shareholder as dividends. See, Hays v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 197195 (Although distri-bution was not prorated between shareholders, other determinates\nof dividend equivalence indicated the distribution to be divi-dends). In the case of Lisle,\nthe Service unsuccessfully chal-lenged the payments made to a corporation's two\nprincipal share-holders. Therein, the disputed redemption was structured using initial\ndown payments followed by a 20-year installment payout. The length of payout,\ncoupled with certain retained rights by the shareholders, lead the Service to argue the\npayments were divi-dends rather than redemption amounts. In the present case, with A's surrender of voting power and agreement to $A as\nthe final payment for A's common shares, persuasive evidence of a disguised\nredemption has been shown. 15 POSTF-106186-02 This writing may contain privileged information.

Because this income is taxable to the\nestate, don\u2019t include this income on your\n-23- own individual income tax return. The\nonly exception is for purposes of figuring your self-employment tax. For that\npurpose, you must take into account all\nyour self-employment income for the\nyear from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is appointed) must allocate between you and\nthe bankruptcy estate the wages, salary,\nor other compensation and withheld income tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for income and withheld income tax reported\nto you on Forms 1099. You must also\ninclude a statement that indicates you\nfiled a chapter 11 case and that explains\nhow income and withheld income tax reported to you on Forms W-2 and 1099\nare allocated between you and the estate.
