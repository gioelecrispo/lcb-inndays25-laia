    "text": "13 noted in Gilmore, can lead to capricious results and a concomitant\nlack of uniformity in the application of our tax laws. Finally, as the\nCourt noted in Woodward, a test based upon taxpayer's purpose in\ndefending or settling litigation would encourage resort to\n\u2018formalisms and artificial distinctions.\u2019 427 F.2d at 433 (emphasis added). For Corporation X, the origin of the claim litigated, which gave rise to the attorney fees\nat issue, was to acquire a capital asset for all the reasons stated in the September 14,\n2011 Memorandum. Also, as stated by the Anchor Coupling Court at the close of its\nopinion: The Government offers another argument which we think should be\nmentioned briefly to further buttress the result we have reached. It\nargues that the settlement and release received by Anchor in return\nfor its settlement payment created enforceable rights in Anchor\nwhich constituted the acquisition of a capital asset. We agree that\nthe transaction can also be viewed in this manner. Thus, if Anchor\nhad completed the proposed sale of its assets by accepting\n$4,025,000 and then repurchased its assets for $4,625,000, it can\nhardly be doubted that the $600,000 premium would be included in\nthe new book value of Anchor's assets. The settlement in this case\naccomplished an identical purpose and should be accompanied by\nidentical tax treatment. 427 F.2d at 434 (citation omitted, emphasis added). The litigation that gave rise to Corporation X\u2019s liability to pay the attorney fees at issue\nherein originated in the process of acquiring the right to market and sell generic drugs in\nthe United States, with that fact not changed by the settlement. However, Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.197-2(b)(8) providing that government-granted licenses are \u00a7 197 intangibles does\nnot apply to the settlement licenses because they are not government granted; the\nsettlement licenses are between Corporation X and the plaintiffs in the infringement\nactions. While the licenses may grant Corporation X the right to use patented\nintangibles, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(c)(7) provides that \u201c[s]ection 197 intangibles do not\ninclude any interest (including an interest as a licensee) in a patent \u2026 that is not\nacquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business.\u201d Corporation X did not acquire\nthe settlement licenses as part of the acquisition of a trade or business. However, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(d)(2)(ii)(B) provides (emphasis added):\nContracts for the use of intangibles. A section 197 intangible is not\na self-created intangible to the extent that it results from the entry\ninto (or renewal of) a contract for the use of an existing section 197 POSTU-139175-10 14 intangible. Thus, for example, the exception for self-created\nintangibles does not apply to capitalized costs, such as legal and\nother professional fees, incurred by a licensee in connection with\nthe entry into (or renewal of) a contract for the use of know-how or\nsimilar property. So, to the extent the licenses received in the settlement of the ANDA infringement\nlitigation relative to ANDA Two and in the settlement of the ANDA infringement litigation\nrelative to ANDA Three were for the use of \u00a7 197 intangibles as described in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(11), the fees are still amortizable pursuant to \u00a7 197.",

Villageliu, Senior Counsel &\nIndustry Counsel (Food & Beverages) (RFP&H) (Large & Mid-Size Business) Use of Gift Card Disregarded Entity This memorandum responds to your request for assistance. This advice may not be\nused or cited as precedent. LEGEND\nCompany A = ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------= -------------------------Parent\nEntity B\n= -----------------------------------Year 1\n= ------Company C = ---------------------------------------------------------ISSUE Whether payments received by Entity B, a single-member limited liability company\n(LLC) that is wholly owned by Company A, are received for the sale of \u201cgoods held by\nthe taxpayer\u201d for purposes of the definition of an advance payment in Treas. Reg.\n\u00a71.451-5(a) (1)(i), if the gift cards may be redeemed only for goods held for sale by\nCompany A. POSTF-142534-092\nCONCLUSION Yes. Because Entity B is a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, Entity B\nis treated as an unincorporated division of Company A, and therefore as the same\ntaxpayer as Company A, for purposes of the definition of an advance payment in Treas. Reg. \u00a71.451-5(a)(1)(i). FACTS\nCompany A is Parent\u2019s primary or only operating merchandise retailer subsidiary. Company A owns the retail merchandise inventory that it sells. Company A is the sole\nmember of Entity B, a single-member LLC that is disregarded for federal income tax\npurposes. Entity B was formed in Year 1 to sell gift cards and otherwise administer\nCompany A\u2019s gift card program. 1 Company A\u2019s inventory is used to redeem the gift\ncards sold by Entity B. Entity B has no title to merchandise inventory, nor its own\nfacilities or stores, and it performs no other activities except for the administration of the\ngift card program. Parent, Company A and Entity B use the accrual method of\naccounting for tax purposes. Assuming the gift card payments received by Entity B are received for the sale of goods\n\u201cheld by the taxpayer,\u201d Entity B otherwise is properly using the deferral method of Treas. Reg. \u00a71.451-5(b)(1)(ii) for the income from the sale of gift cards. The taxpayer has\nattached the required information schedule to its federal income tax returns. See Treas.\nReg. \u00a71.451-5(d). LAW AND ANALYSIS For taxpayers using the accrual method of accounting, Treas. Reg. \u00a71.451-1(a)\nprovides that income generally is includible in gross income when all the events have\noccurred that fix the right to receive the income and the amount can be determined with\nreasonable accuracy. Generally, all events that fix the right to receive income occur\nupon the earliest of when (1) required performance takes place, (2) payment is due, or\n(3) payment is made. See Schlude v. Commissioner, 372 U.S. 128 (1963). Thus, when\na taxpayer receives a payment for goods or services that is includible in the taxpayer\u2019s\ngross income, the taxpayer generally is required to include the payment in income upon\nreceipt, even where the goods or services are to be provided in a future taxable year.

One such circumstance\nwould be where two or more people acting without authorization of the taxpayer filed a\nreturn in the name of the taxpayer. In the rare event that more than one person is\nresponsible for the filing of a frivolous return or submission, then the Service might\nmake more than one assessment, but we recommend that you consult with SBSE\ncounsel in those rare instances where you think this might apply. Issue 1(d). Would the answer to question 1(c) vary if the taxpayer had multiple\nofficers or members? Our answer to question 1(c) would not vary if the taxpayer had multiple officers or\nmembers. Issue 1(e). Would the answer to question 1(c) vary if the business return was\nsigned or if no one signed the return? The application of the penalty under section 6702(a) does not depend on\nwhether the return is signed or unsigned. It does not depend on whether the return is\nvalid or invalid. The statute only requires the filing of what \u201cpurports to be a return.\u201d As\nlong as the party acting for the entity was authorized to file the purported return, the\nService should treat the filing as the filing of the entity and assess the penalty on that\nbasis. If the Service obtains evidence that the person submitting the return acted\nwithout authorization, then the person filing the purported return could have the penalty\nassessed against them. While it is possible that several unauthorized persons could\nparticipate in the filing of a purported return, we think that you would seldom encounter\nsuch a situation. If you do, as discussed above, we recommend that you contact SBSE\ncounsel for further advice before asserting a penalty against multiple persons. 4\nIssue 1(f). Would the Service need to apply different rules when dealing with a\nsole proprietorship as compared with a partnership or a limited liability\ncompany? If so, what would those rules or considerations be? If a sole proprietorship files a business return, then the Service can easily focus\non whether the sole proprietor signed the return. If someone else signed the return,\nthen the Service would need to focus on what role the signing party held in signing the\nreturn. If the signing party was authorized to do so, then the same conclusions would\nfollow as when the sole proprietor signs, i.e. the taxpayer is responsible for the frivolous\n4 If the document prepared by the return preparer is so deficient as to not meet the requirements for a\nvalid return, it could affect the determination of a penalty against the return preparer. Section 6694\nimposes a penalty on a person who prepares a return or claim for refund. If the document did not qualify\nas a valid return, the person could argue that section 6694 did not apply. In contrast, section 6701\nimposes liability on a person who aids or assist in, procures or advises with respect to the preparation of\nany return, affidavit, claim or other document.",

The Act further provides that the FCC may make\nsuch regulations not inconsistent with law as it may deem necessary to prevent\ninterference between stations and to carry out the provisions of this Act. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\n303(f). If the reallocated spectrum and the equipment are conceived as one economic\nunit, then it is evident that the reallocation of spectrum under these facts is tantamount\nto the taking of the equipment. The \u201ceconomic unit\" approach was applied in Masser v.\nCommissioner, 30 T.C. 741 (1958), where the taxpayer sold property physically\nadjacent to, and used in connection with, certain converted property. In that case, the\nTax Court determined that the subsequent sale was encompassed within the\ninvoluntary conversion. Under the economic unit analysis, the Court recognized that\ncertain business assets are so necessarily intertwined that the condemnation of a\nportion of such assets is in effect a conversion of all of the assets of the economic unit. The Service likewise has formally recognized this same \u201ceconomic unit\u201d approach for\ndetermining the scope of involuntary conversions under I.R.C. \u00a7 1033. See Rev. Rul.\n59-361, 1959-2 C.B. 183. In the present case, the BAS spectrum and the equipment permitted by the FCC\nfor use on such band form an economic unit. The reallocation and relicensing of the\nspectrum (which in itself does not constitute a taking of any property right of the\nbroadcast station) necessitates the removal and replacement of the existing BAS\nequipment. This circumstance constitutes a \u201ctaking\u201d of the broadcast station's\nequipment. When, as here, the FCC requires a broadcaster to discontinue use of its\nown equipment, rendering such equipment useless for any purpose, the previouslyused equipment has been \u201ctaken\u201d by a governmental authority for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7\n1033. B. Public Use Requirement A \"public use\" includes the advancement of a \u201cpublic purpose\u201d by a transfer of CC:LM:CTM:LA:2:POSTF-108806-08 page 6 ownership of privately-held property to (i) a governmental entity, or (ii) a private\nenterprise, provided that in each case there is an advancement of \"the broader and\nmore natural interpretation of public use as public purpose.\" Kelo v. City of New\nLondon, 545 U.S. 469, 480 (2005). Moreover, the Supreme Court in Kelo stated, \u201cThe\npublic end may be as well or better served through an agency of private enterprise than\nthrough a department of government.\u201d Id., at 486 fn.16, citing Berman v. Parker, 348\nU.S. 26, 33-4 (1954). Accordingly, for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 1033, it makes no difference\nif the property taken for public use is being transferred to a third party as opposed to a\ngovernmental entity.
