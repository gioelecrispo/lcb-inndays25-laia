    "text": ". .\n(3) The amount of the special refund allowed as a credit shall be considered as\nan amount deducted and withheld as income tax at the source under Chapter 24\nof the Internal Revenue Code. . . If the amount of such special refund when\nadded to amounts deducted and withheld as income tax exceeds the taxes\nimposed by subtitle A . . . , the amount of the excess constitutes an overpayment\nof income tax under subtitle A, and interest on such overpayment is allowed to\nthe extent provided under section 6611 upon an overpayment of income tax\nresulting from a credit for income tax withheld at source. See section 6401(b). When the Service has made an erroneous refund as a result of a claim by a\ntaxpayer for an overstated income tax withholding credit, the Service recovers that\nerroneous refund by making an assessment pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6201(a)(3). See, e.g.,\nFeldman v. CIR, T.C. Memo. 1967-91, 1967 WL 1115, at page 2 (Tax Court upheld an\nI.R.C. \u00a7 6201(a)(3) math error adjustment for overstated income tax withholding\nresulting from an unallowable claim of excess Social Security tax withholding). Section\n6201(a)(3) provides:\n(3) Erroneous income tax prepayment credits. If on any return or claim for\nrefund of income taxes under subtitle A there is an overstatement of the credit for\nincome tax withheld at the source, or of the amount paid as estimated income SCAF-109502-06 4 tax, the amount so overstated which is allowed against the tax shown on the\nreturn or which is allowed as a credit or refund may be assessed by the\nSecretary in the same manner as in the case of a mathematical or clerical error\nappearing upon the return, except that the provisions of section 6213(b)(2)\n(relating to abatement of mathematical or clerical error assessments) shall not\napply with regard to any assessment under this paragraph. Amounts claimed by the taxpayer and refunded under I.R.C. \u00a7 31(b) are treated\nas income tax withheld at source under I.R.C. \u00a7 3402 for purposes of subtitle A. Also,\namounts within section 31 are specifically excluded from the definition of a deficiency by\nI.R.C. \u00a7 6211(b)(1), and are not specified in I.R.C. \u00a7 6211(b)(4). This comports with the\ndefinition of what can be assessed under section 6201(a)(3), which is overstated\nincome tax withholding and overstated estimated income tax payments, both of which\nare excluded from the definition of a deficiency by I.R.C. \u00a7 6211(b)(1) and Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 301.6211-1(b).1 Therefore, we believe the amount claimed and erroneously refunded\nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 31(b) can be recovered in the same manner as an overstated claim for\nincome tax withholding. Accordingly, where amounts are claimed by the taxpayer and\nrefunded under the provisions of I.R.C. \u00a7 31(b), the Service can make a summary\nassessment of the overstated amount claimed using the procedures provided in I.R.C.\n\u00a7 6201(a)(3).

Specifically, it has challenged taxpayer\u2019s characterization of\nthe advances to ----and -----as debt. If a sufficient portion of\nthe loans to -----and ---are reclassified as equity, -----and ------- would have been solvent at the time of the deemed liquidations, triggering the application of section 332. The taxpayer disagrees with the audit team\u2019s\nreclassification of the loans as equity. In the alternative, the\ntaxpayer argues that even if the loans to --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------and -- were characterized as\nequity, the advances should be treated as a preferred class of\nequity since the notes issued by -----and ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------provided for a stated rate of\nreturn on the investment. Taxpayer argues that since the\nreclassified debt is treated as preferred stock, section 332 does\nnot apply with respect to the common stock pursuant to\nCommissioner v.

As discussed above, in a liquidation assets are deemed\ndistributed first with respect to debt, then with respect to\npreferred stock and finally with respect to common stock. Therefore, in our case, if the intercompany debt is treated as\npreferred stock (in total or part), then the assets of ------------ and ---are treated as distributed first with respect to the\npreferred stock and then with respect to the common stock. Pursuant to Spaulding Bakeries and H.K. Porter Company, if there\nis no property remaining for distribution on the common stock\nafter the preferred, then section 332 does not apply with respect\nto the common shares. Where the investment in the preferred\nstock is only partially satisfied, section 331 would apply\nresulting in a capital loss for the portion of the investment not\nrecaptured. 5 On the other hand, if the intercompany loans are treated as\ncommon stock and there are no other loans outstanding, then the\nassets of -----and ----would be deemed distributed with respect\nto the common stock on the liquidation. Since property would be\nreceived with respect to the common shares, section 332 would\napply in denying the recognition of any loss realized in the\n5 If the intercompany debt is not reclassified as equity, then\nsection 166 would permit an ordinary loss for the portion of the\nintercompany loans not satisfied in the liquidation. Therefore,\nreclassifying intercompany debt as preferred stock has the\nresult of converting an ordinary loss into a capital loss with\nrespect to the investment in the preferred stock (reclassified\ndebt) not recouped in the liquidation. liquidation. In determining the true substance of an intercompany advance,\nthe legal rights and obligations of the parties must be\nconsidered. See Fin Hay Realty Co. v.

Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nCases If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case, income taxable to the bankruptcy estate and reported on the estate's\nincome tax return includes:\n\u2022 Earnings from services you performed after the beginning of the case\n(both wages and self-employment income); and\n\u2022 Income from property described in\nsection 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code\nthat you either owned when the case began or that you acquired after the case\nbegan and before the case was closed,\ndismissed, or converted to a case under a\ndifferent chapter. Because this income is taxable to the\nestate, don\u2019t include this income on your\n-23- own individual income tax return. The\nonly exception is for purposes of figuring your self-employment tax. For that\npurpose, you must take into account all\nyour self-employment income for the\nyear from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is appointed) must allocate between you and\nthe bankruptcy estate the wages, salary,\nor other compensation and withheld income tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for income and withheld income tax reported\nto you on Forms 1099. You must also\ninclude a statement that indicates you\nfiled a chapter 11 case and that explains\nhow income and withheld income tax reported to you on Forms W-2 and 1099\nare allocated between you and the estate. For more details, including acceptable\nallocation methods, see Notice 2006-83,\n2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at\nIRS.gov/irb/\n2006-40_IRB#NOT-2006-83. Community Property States\nCommunity property states include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington,\nand Wisconsin. If you and your spouse\nlived in a community property state, you\nmust usually follow state law to determine what is community income and\nwhat is separate income. For details, see\nForm 8958 and Pub. 555. Nevada, Washington, and California\ndomestic partners. A registered domestic partner in Nevada, Washington,\nor California must generally report half\nthe combined community income of the\nindividual and their domestic partner. See Form 8958 and Pub. 555. Rounding Off to Whole\nDollars You can round off cents to whole dollars\non your return and schedules. If you do\nround to whole dollars, you must round\nall amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from\n50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more\namounts to figure the amount to enter on\na line, include cents when adding the\namounts and round off only the total. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. If you are entering amounts that include cents, make sure to include the\ndecimal point. There is no cents column\non the form. The lines on Forms 1040 and\n1040-SR are the same.

    "text": "Upon\nthe applicant\u2019s written request, the Internal Revenue\nService will afford the applicant the opportunity to\nbe heard with respect to the application. (d) Compliance and suitability checks. (1) As a condition to consideration of an\napplication, the Internal Revenue Service may\nconduct a Federal tax compliance check and\nsuitability check. The tax compliance check will be\nlimited to an inquiry regarding whether an applicant\nhas filed all required individual or business tax\nreturns and whether the applicant has failed to pay, or\nmake proper arrangements with the Internal Revenue\nService for payment of, any Federal tax debts. The suitability check will be limited to an inquiry\nregarding whether an applicant has engaged in any\nconduct that would justify suspension or disbarment\nof any practitioner under the provisions of this part\non the date the application is submitted, including\nwhether the applicant has engaged in disreputable\nconduct as defined in \u00a710.51. The application will\nbe denied only if the results of the compliance or\nsuitability check are sufficient to establish that the\npractitioner engaged in conduct subject to sanctions\nunder \u00a7\u00a710.51 and 10.52. (2) If the applicant does not pass the tax\ncompliance or suitability check, the applicant will\nnot be issued an enrollment or registration card or\ncertificate pursuant to \u00a710.6(b) of this part. An\napplicant who is initially denied enrollment or\nregistration for failure to pass a tax compliance\ncheck may reapply after the initial denial if the\napplicant becomes current with respect to the\napplicant\u2019s tax liabilities. (e) Temporary recognition. On receipt of a properly\nexecuted application, the Commissioner, or delegate,\nmay grant the applicant temporary recognition to\npractice pending a determination as to whether status\nas an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent,\nor registered tax return preparer should be granted. Temporary recognition will be granted only in\nunusual circumstances and it will not be granted, in\nany circumstance, if the application is not regular on\nits face, if the information stated in the application,\nPage 10 \u2014 \u00a7 10.5 if true, is not sufficient to warrant granting the\napplication to practice, or the Commissioner,\nor delegate, has information indicating that the\nstatements in the application are untrue or that the\napplicant would not otherwise qualify to become\nan enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or\nregistered tax return preparer. Issuance of temporary\nrecognition does not constitute either a designation\nor a finding of eligibility as an enrolled agent,\nenrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax\nreturn preparer, and the temporary recognition may\nbe withdrawn at any time. (f) Protest of application denial. The applicant\nwill be informed in writing as to the reason(s) for\nany denial of an application. The applicant may,\nwithin 30 days after receipt of the notice of denial of\nthe application, file a written protest of the denial as\nprescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms,\nguidance, or other appropriate guidance.

    "text": "Although we assume for purposes of this\nmemorandum that tax has been paid to\n, we have no\nknowledge of any such payment. Accordingly, TP-FSC is entitled\nto a FTC only to the extent it paid taxes to\n. In\ncontrast, no FTC would be available to TP-FSC if the income\nretained its character as rental income because rental income\nwould qualify as FTI. Further, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.921-3T(d)(2)(ii)\nprovides that the FTC for domestic corporate shareholders in\nforeign corporations provided under \u00a7 901(a) as determined under\nInternal Revenue Code \u00a7 902 is allowed for income taxes deemed\npaid or accrued by a FSC only to the extent those taxes are\ndeemed paid or accrued with respect to the FSC\u2019s \u00a7 923(a)(2) nonexempt income and its non-foreign income (here, TP-FSC\u2019s interest\nincome). Issue 3: Is parent/taxpayer entitled to a deemed paid FTC with\nrespect to such recharacterized interest income? CC:LM:FS:LI:POSTF-129710-02 page 6 We assume that parent/taxpayer is not subject to foreign\nincome tax with respect to TP-FSC\u2019s interest income and,\ntherefore, would not be entitled to a direct FTC under\n\u00a7 901(b)(1). The question remains whether parent/taxpayer may be\nentitled to a deemed paid FTC under \u00a7 902. Section 902(a)\nprovides that a domestic corporation owning 10 percent or more of\nthe voting stock of a foreign corporation from which it receives\ndividends in any taxable year shall be deemed to have paid a\nportion of such foreign corporation\u2019s income taxes. Since\nparent/taxpayer owns 100 percent of TP-FSC, this provision\napplies here. However, \u00a7 906(b)(6) provides that, for purposes of \u00a7 902,\nany income taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid or accrued, to\nany foreign country with respect to ECI shall not be taken into\naccount. Since we concluded above that the recharacterized\ninterest income here would be ECI, under \u00a7 906(b)(6) the\nparent/taxpayer would not be entitled to a deemed paid FTC under\n\u00a7 902. Issue 4: Will parent/taxpayer\u2019s FTC limitation increase as a\nresult of the above recharacterization of income? Under \u00a7 904(a), the total amount of the credit taken under\n\u00a7 901(a) shall not exceed the same proportion of the tax against\nwhich such credit is taken which the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income\nfrom sources without the United States (but not in excess of the\ntaxpayer\u2018s entire taxable income) bears to his entire taxable\nincome for the same taxable year. Based on Internal Revenue Code\n\u00a7\u00a7 861(a)(1) and 862(a)(1) 4 and the regulations thereunder, the\ninterest received from the foreign Tax Exempt Entity in this OFSC transaction would not be U.S. source income because: (1) it\nwas not interest paid by the United States or any\nagency/instrumentality thereof; (2) it was not interest paid by a\nresident of the United States since this Tax Exempt Entity, to\nour knowledge, did not qualify as a foreign corporation or\npartnership engaged in a trade or business within the United 4 Section 861(a)(1) states that interest income shall be\ntreated as income from sources within the United States when it\nis interest income from the United States or the District of\nColumbia, or interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing\nobligations of domestic corporations or certain non-corporate\nresidents.",

Requirements for an\nElectronic Return To file your return electronically, you\nmust sign the return electronically using\na personal identification number (PIN)\nand provide the information described\nbelow. If you are filing online using\nsoftware, you must use a Self-Select\nPIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a\nSelf-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. For 2022, if we issued you an identity\nprotection personal identification number (IP PIN) (as described in more detail\nbelow), all six digits of your IP PIN\nmust appear in the IP PIN spaces provi- ded next to the space for your occupation for your electronic signature to be\ncomplete. Failure to include an issued IP\nPIN on the electronic return will result\nin an invalid signature and a rejected return. If you are filing a joint return and\nboth taxpayers were issued an IP PIN,\nenter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN\nmethod allows you to create your own\nPIN. If you are married filing jointly,\nyou and your spouse will each need to\ncreate a PIN and enter these PINs as\nyour electronic signatures. A PIN is any combination of five digits you choose except five zeros. If you\nuse a PIN, there is nothing to sign and\nnothing to mail\u2014not even your Forms\nW-2. Your electronic return is considered a\nvalidly signed return only when it includes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your adjusted gross income (AGI) from your\noriginally filed 2021 federal income tax\nreturn, if applicable. If you're filing\njointly, your electronic return must also\ninclude your spouse's PIN, last name,\ndate of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and\nAGI, if applicable, in order to be considered validly signed. Don\u2019t use your AGI\nfrom an amended return (Form 1040-X)\nor a math error correction made by the\nIRS. AGI is the amount shown on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11.

(If you filed electronically last year, you, and your\nspouse if filing jointly, may use your\nprior year PIN to verify your identity instead of your prior year AGI. The prior\nyear PIN is the five-digit PIN you used\nto electronically sign your 2021 return.) You can't use the Self-Select\nPIN method if you are a\nCAUTION first-time filer under age 16 at\nthe end of 2022. ! Practitioner PIN.
