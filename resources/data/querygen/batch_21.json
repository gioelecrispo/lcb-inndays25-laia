LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition,\nLITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak\nEnglish as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, see\nthe LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate.

Eligible\nindividuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance\ncompany. If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the\npremium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach\nForm 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year. The Marketplace is required to send Form 1095-A by January 31, 2023, listing the advance payments and other\ninformation you need to complete Form 8962. 1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace. 2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments. 3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR. (Don\u2019t include Form 1095-A.) Health Coverage Reporting If you or someone in your family was an employee in 2022, the employer may be required to send you Form\n1095-C. Part II of Form 1095-C shows whether your employer offered you health insurance coverage and, if\nso, information about the offer. You should receive Form 1095-C by early March 2023. This information may be\nrelevant if you purchased health insurance coverage for 2022 through the Health Insurance Marketplace and\nwish to claim the premium tax credit on Schedule 3, line 9. However, you don\u2019t need to wait to receive this form\nto file your return. You may rely on other information received from your employer. If you don\u2019t wish to claim the\npremium tax credit for 2022, you don\u2019t need the information in Part II of Form 1095-C.",

    "text": "However, because Corporation X created,\nrather than acquired, its franchise, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(e)(2) does not impact the\ntreatment of Corporation X\u2019s ANDA One as an amortizable \u00a7 197 intangible. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(d)(2) reiterates the statute and clarifies the status of created\nintangibles, stating:\nExcept as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section,\namortizable section 197 intangibles do not include any\nsection 197 intangible created by the taxpayer (a selfcreated intangible). Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197(d)(2)(iii) confirms franchises are not excluded from amortizable\n\u00a7 197 intangibles, citing I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(F). As discussed above, an approved ANDA is a government granted franchise within both\nI.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(F) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(10). The self-created exception only\napplies to any \u00a7 197 intangible NOT described in I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(D), (E), and (F). Therefore, the exception provided in I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(2) is inapplicable to FDA approved\nANDAs. Accordingly, FDA-approved ANDA One is an amortizable \u00a7 197 intangible. 3. As Franchises, FDA-Approved ANDAs\nMust Be Amortized Over a 15-Year Period The Internal Revenue Code (Code) provides a taxpayer shall be entitled to an\namortization deduction with respect to any amortizable \u00a7 197 intangible. \u00a7 197(a). The\nCode also provides that the amount of such deduction shall be determined by\namortizing the adjusted basis of such intangible ratably over the \u201c15-year period\nbeginning with the month in which such intangible was acquired.\u201d Id. See Frontier POSTU-139175-10 11 Chevrolet Company v. Commissioner, 329 F.3d 1131, 1135 (9th Cir. 2003) (an\namortizable \u00a7 197 intangible must use the 15-year period for amortization, not some\nother life that the taxpayer asserts). The Treasury Regulations further elaborate on the computation of the amortization\ndeduction by providing:\n[T]he amortization deduction allowable under section 197(a) is computed\nas follows:\n(i)\nThe basis of an amortizable section 197 intangible is\namortized ratably over the 15-year period beginning on the\nlater of\u2014\n(A)\nThe first day of the month in which the property is\nacquired; or\n(B)\nIn the case of property held in connection with the\nconduct of a trade or business or in an activity\ndescribed in section 212, the first day of the month\nin which the conduct of the trade or business or\nthe activity begins. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(f)(1)(i) (emphasis added). See Broz II, above (the \u00a7 197\nregulations support the determination that a \u00a7 197 intangible cannot be amortized if the\ntrade or business or activity to which it relates has yet to commence). An FDA-approved ANDA is acquired for purposes of \u00a7 197 on the effective date of the\nfinal FDA approval, provided all applicable exclusionary periods have expired, e.g, the\neffective date is not subject to a condition precedent such as the expiration of period of\nexclusivity barring the ANDA holder from immediately commencing the marketing and\nselling of the drugs that are the subject of the ANDA in the United States. 7 ANDAs are\ntreated as acquired on said date because that is the date the holder of an ANDA can\nbegin to market and sell the generic drugs that are the subject of the ANDA in the\nUnited States. Applying the rule of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(f)(1) to Corporation X, Corporation X\u2019s 15year amortization period for amortizing the attorney fees associated with its FDAapproved ANDA",

The total of lines 25d, 26, and\nSchedule 3, line 11, on your 2022 return\nis at least 100% of the tax shown on\nyour 2021 return (110% of that amount\nif you aren't a farmer or fisherman, and your adjusted gross income (AGI)\nshown on your 2021 return was more\nthan $150,000 (more than $75,000 if\nmarried filing separately for 2022)). Your estimated tax payments for 2022\nmust have been made on time and for\nthe required amount.

Figuring the Penalty If you choose to figure the penalty yourself, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farmers and fishermen). Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the\npenalty to any tax due and enter the total\non line 37. However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37. Don\u2019t file Form 2210 with your return unless Form 2210 indicates that you\nmust do so. Instead, keep it for your records. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. -60- Because Form 2210 is compli- TIP cated, you can leave line 38\nblank and the IRS will figure\nthe penalty and send you a bill.

    "text": "Exception. You won't owe the penalty\nif your 2021 tax return was for a tax\nyear of 12 full months and either of the\nfollowing applies. 1. You had no tax shown on your\n2021 return and you were a U.S. citizen\nor resident for all of 2021. 2. The total of lines 25d, 26, and\nSchedule 3, line 11, on your 2022 return\nis at least 100% of the tax shown on\nyour 2021 return (110% of that amount\nif you aren't a farmer or fisherman, and your adjusted gross income (AGI)\nshown on your 2021 return was more\nthan $150,000 (more than $75,000 if\nmarried filing separately for 2022)). Your estimated tax payments for 2022\nmust have been made on time and for\nthe required amount. For most people, the \u201ctax shown on\nyour 2021 return\u201d is the amount on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24,\nminus the total of any amounts shown\non lines 27a, 28, 29, and 30; Schedule 3,\nlines 9, 12, 13b, 13g, and 13h; and\nForms 8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III\nthrough IX only), 8885, and 8919. Also\nsubtract from line 24 any:\n\u2022 Tax on an excess parachute payment,\n\u2022 Excise tax on insider stock compensation of an expatriated corporation,\n\u2022 Uncollected social security and\nMedicare or RRTA tax on tips or\ngroup-term life insurance, and\n\u2022 Look-back interest due under section 167(g) or 460(b). When figuring the amount on line 24,\ninclude household employment taxes\nonly if line 25d is more than zero or you\nwould have owed the estimated tax penalty for 2021 even if you didn't include\nthose taxes. If the Exception just described\ndoesn't apply, see the Instructions for\nForm 2210 for other situations in which\nyou may be able to lower your penalty\nby filing Form 2210. Figuring the Penalty If you choose to figure the penalty yourself, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farmers and fishermen). Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the\npenalty to any tax due and enter the total\non line 37. However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37. Don\u2019t file Form 2210 with your return unless Form 2210 indicates that you\nmust do so. Instead, keep it for your records. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. -60- Because Form 2210 is compli- TIP cated, you can leave line 38\nblank and the IRS will figure\nthe penalty and send you a bill. We\nwon't charge you interest on the penalty\nif you pay by the date specified on the\nbill. If your income varied during the\nyear, the annualized income installment\nmethod may reduce the amount of your\npenalty. But you must file Form 2210\nbecause the IRS can't figure your penalty under this method. Third Party Designee",
