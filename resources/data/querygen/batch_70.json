    "text": "See Form 4972. Lines 6a, 6b, and 6c\nLines 6a and 6b\nSocial Security Benefits You should receive a Form SSA-1099\nshowing in box 3 the total social security benefits paid to you. Box 4 will show\nthe amount of any benefits you repaid in\n2022. If you received railroad retirement\nbenefits treated as social security, you\nshould receive a Form RRB-1099. Use the Social Security Benefits\nWorksheet in these instructions to see if\nany of your benefits are taxable. Exception. Do not use the Social Security Benefits Worksheet in these instructions if any of the following applies. \u2022 You made contributions to a traditional IRA for 2022 and you or your\nspouse were covered by a retirement\nplan at work or through self-employment. Instead, use the worksheets in\nPub. 590-A to see if any of your social\nsecurity benefits are taxable and to figure your IRA deduction. \u2022 You repaid any benefits in 2022\nand your total repayments (box 4) were\nmore than your total benefits for 2022\n(box 3). None of your benefits are taxable for 2022. Also, if your total repayments in 2022 exceed your total benefits\nreceived in 2022 by more than $3,000,\nyou may be able to take an itemized deduction or a credit for part of the excess\nrepayments if they were for benefits you\nincluded in income in an earlier year. For more details, see Pub. 915.\n\u2022 You file Form 2555, 4563, or\n8815, or you exclude employer-provided\nadoption benefits or income from sources within Puerto Rico. Instead, use the\nworksheet in Pub. 915. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. -30- Social security information. TIP Social security beneficiaries\ncan now get a variety of information from the SSA website with a my\nSocial Security account, including getting a replacement Form SSA\u20101099 if\nneeded. For more information and to set\nup an account, go to SSA.gov/\nmyaccount. Disability payments. Don\u2019t include in\nyour income any disability payments\n(including Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments) you receive\nfor injuries incurred as a direct result of\na terrorist attack directed against the\nUnited States (or its allies), whether outside or within the United States. In the\ncase of the September 11 attacks, injuries eligible for coverage by the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund are\ntreated as incurred as a direct result of\nthe attack. If these payments are incorrectly reported as taxable on Form\nSSA-1099, don't include the nontaxable\nportion of income on your tax return. You may receive a notice from the IRS\nregarding the omitted payments. Follow\nthe instructions in the notice to explain\nthat the excluded payments aren't taxable. For more information about these\npayments, see Pub. 3920. Example. Taxpayer X, a firefighter,\nwas disabled as a direct result of the\nSeptember 11 terrorist attack on the\nWorld Trade Center. X began receiving\nSocial Security Disability Insurance\n(SSDI) benefits at age 54. X's full retirement age for social security retirement\nbenefits is age 66. X's birthday is April\n25. In the year X turned 66, X received\n$1,500 per month in benefits from the\nSocial Security Administration (for a total of $18,000). Because X became eligible for a full retirement benefit in May,\nthe month after X turned 66, X can exclude only four months (January through\nApril) of their annual benefit from their\nincome ($6,000).",

    "text": "Because X's transaction costs do not\nexceed $5,000, X's transaction costs are de minimis within the\nmeaning of paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, X is\nnot required to capitalize the $4,000 payment to its outside counsel\nunder this section. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(l)(1)(emphasis added). In the example quoted above, the $4,000 paid to outside counsel was below the de\nminimus safe harbor so was not capitalizable. In this case, the attorney fees for each\nANDA far exceed $5,000, and must be aggregated by ANDA because the investigations\nand litigation fees for each ANDA were part of a series of steps in a plan to obtain an\nFDA-approved ANDA. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)(3). Just as the license addressed in\nthe example, Corporation X\u2019s ANDAs are effective indefinitely provided Corporation X\ncomplies with all applicable laws and regulations, and the drugs do not have adverse\nside effects that cause the FDA to withdraw its approval. Accordingly, the attorney fees\nCorporation X incurred that are the subject of this advice must be capitalized because\nthey were incurred to facilitate, directly or indirectly, obtaining the FDA-approved\nANDAs that granted Corporation X the right to market and sell its ANDA products in the\nUnited States. See also Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)(5), Example 3. B. Amounts Paid to Create or Enhance a Separate and Distinct Intangible The capitalization of intangible regulations provide that amounts paid to create or\nenhance a separate and distinct intangible must be capitalized. Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.263(a)-4(b)(1)(iii). Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(b)(3)(i) defines separate and\ndistinct asset, as follows: The term separate and distinct intangible asset means a property\ninterest of ascertainable and measurable value in money's worth\nthat is subject to protection under applicable State, Federal or POSTU-139175-10 45 foreign law and the possession and control of which is intrinsically\ncapable of being sold, transferred or pledged (ignoring any\nrestrictions imposed on assignability) separate and apart from a\ntrade or business. . . . The determination of whether a payment\ncreates a separate and distinct intangible asset is made based on\nall of the facts and circumstances existing during the taxable year\nin which the payment is made. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(b)(3)(i)(emphasis added). ANDAs are within the definition of separate and distinct intangible assets. ANDAs can\nbe transferred from the sponsor (original applicant) to another, separate and apart from\na trade or business. 21 C.F.R . \u00a7 314.72(a). ANDAs are subject to protection under\nFederal law. For example, when an ANDA holder has 180 days of exclusivity, federal\nlaw precludes any other generic for the referenced NDA from being approved during the\nperiod of exclusivity. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)(IV)(2010). An entire profitable\nindustry, the generic pharmaceutical industry, has evolved around the value of the\nANDAs.43 While it would take an expert, the expected stream of income from each\nANDA could be projected and then valued at its net present value. Accordingly, each\nANDA is a separate and distinct asset with the professional fees paid to enhance or\nfacilitate the creation of these separate and distinct assets capitalized. Treas.

No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number.

    "text": "The\nexample follows the rules set forth in the above revenue rulings and cases, which\nprovide that a NOL is personal in nature to the taxpayer sustaining the loss and only\navailable in other years to offset the income of the same taxpayer. Thus, when the NOL\nis incurred by a single taxpayer but is carried to a joint year, a separate taxable income\nmust be computed for each spouse in the carryback year to ensure that the NOL is\nused to offset only the income of the spouse who incurred the loss. The example is\nintended to demonstrate the principles of \u00a7 172 only and, therefore, the phase-outs for\nitemized deductions and personal exemptions are ignored. Further, a married filing\njointly (MFJ) tax rate of 20% and married filing separately (MFS) rate of 25% are used\nfor purposes of simplicity. Illustration and analysis of an allocation of a NOL from a single filing tax year to a\njoint tax year\nYear 1 Tax return information (Phaseouts are ignored for purposes of this\nillustration): Spouse 1 (S1) and Spouse 2 (S2) filed income tax return under a\nmarried filing jointly status and reported the following items:\nS1 S2 Joint Gross income $100,000 $150,000 $250,000 Adjusted gross\nIncome 100,000 150,000 250,000 Personal exemption (10,000) (10,000) (20,000) Mortgage interest (15,000) (15,000) (30,000) Real estate taxes (10,000) (10,000) (20,000) (40,000) (21,250)* Medical expenses\nTaxable income 158,750 12\nTax liability (20%) 31,750 * The $21,250 medical expense deduction is the extent to which the expense\n($40,000) exceeds 7.5% of AGI ($18,750). S1 and S2 each paid \u00bd of the joint ax liability, or $15,875. Year 2: S1 and S2 divorce. Both file a separate return reporting positive taxable\nincome and a tax liability. Year 3: S2 incurs a NOL of $210,000. S2 does not elect to forego the carryback of the\nNOL and thus must carry the NOL to Year 1. The NOL carryback may only offset S2's\nincome in the carryback year. Thus, unlike other NOL situations, the carryback amount\nis not the entire NOL but only the amount of S2's income computed as if S2 filed a\nseparate return. The amount of the carryback and, thus, S2's NOL deduction in Year 1\nis computed as follows:\nStep 1: Determine the amount of S2's NOL that may be carried back\nS2\nGross income $150,000 AGI 150,000 Personal exemption (10,000) Mortgage interest\ndeduction (15,000) Real estate taxes\ndeduction (10,000) Medical expense\ndeduction (100%) (28,750)* Taxable income $ 86,250 NOL carryback\nallowable/NOL\ndeduction $ 86,250 * The $28,750 medical expense deduction is the extent to which the expense\n($40,000) exceeds 7.5% of AGI ($11,250).

Neither the Code nor the applicable regulations define \u201citem,\u201d but the Tax Court in Amity\nLeather Products Co. opined that a narrower definition will provide a more accurate\nmeasure of inflation, although the Court acknowledged that the definition of \u201citem\u201d must POSTF-140663-09 5 be administratively feasible and not unduly burdensome. 82 T.C. at 734. A narrower\ndefinition of item more clearly reflects income because it prevents factors other than\ninflation from entering inventory. See id. at 733-34. The Tax Court gave the following\nexample in Amnity Leather Products Co. to illustrate this point:\n[I]f a taxpayer\u2019s inventory experiences mix changes that result in the\nsubstitution of less expensive goods for more expensive goods, the\ntreatment of those goods as a single item increases taxable income. This\noccurs because any inflation in the cost of an item is offset by the\nreduction in cost resulting from the shift to less expensive goods. Conversely, if changes in mix of the inventory result in the substitution of\nmore expensive goods for less expensive goods, the treatment of those\ngoods as a single item decreases taxable income because the increase in\ninventory costs is eliminated from the LIFO costs of the goods as if such\ncost increase represented inflation. Id. at 733. Therefore, a LIFO calculation is affected by the pools and items used by a taxpayer, as\nwell as the costs of the items in a pool. In light of this, the statement in the Closing\nAgreement that --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------is meant to lock-in\nthe taxpayer\u2019s pre-Year 2 LIFO calculations and the data affecting such calculations, not\nto establish the suitability of item definitions going forward. In fact, nothing in the\nagreement references the taxpayer\u2019s item definitions in the context of the\nappropriateness of such definitions or otherwise indicates that this was an issue the\nClosing Agreement was meant to resolve. As will be discussed below, the language of\nthe agreement does not support the taxpayer\u2019s interpretation. Closing Agreements\nInternal Revenue Code section 7121(a) authorizes the Secretary to enter into closing\nagreements \u201cwith any person relating to the liability of such person . . . in respect of any\ninternal revenue tax for any taxable period.\u201d Section 7121(b) provides that\nIf such agreement is approved by the Secretary (within such time as may\nbe stated in such agreement, or later agreed to) such agreement shall be\nfinal and conclusive, and, except upon a showing of fraud or malfeasance,\nor misrepresentation of a material fact \u2013\n(1) the case shall not be reopened as to the matters agreed upon or the\nagreement modified by any officer, employee, or agent of the United\nStates, and POSTF-140663-09 6 (2) in any suit, action, or proceeding, such agreement, or any\ndetermination, assessment, collection, payment, abatement, refund, or\ncredit made in accordance therewith, shall not be annulled, modified, set\naside, or disregarded. Treasury Regulation section 301.7121-1(b)(3) provides that closing agreements may be\nwith respect to taxable periods ending subsequent to the date of the agreement.",

However, a rollover to a\nRoth IRA or a designated Roth account\nis generally not a tax-free distribution.

From that result, subtract\nthe amount of the rollover. Enter the remaining amount on line 5b. If the remaining amount is zero and you have no\nother distribution to report on line 5b,\nenter -0- on line 5b. Also enter \"Rollover\" next to line 5b.

    "text": "Applying the rule of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(f)(1) to Corporation X, Corporation X\u2019s 15year amortization period for amortizing the attorney fees associated with its FDAapproved ANDA One would begin the first day of the month in which the FDA finally\napproved the ANDA as effective with no exclusionary periods barring the immediate\nmarketing and selling of a drug that is the subject of the ANDA, since that is the later\ndate of when the Corporation X entered into a trade or business or when the\namortizable \u00a7 197 intangible was acquired. 7 See, September 14, 2011 Memorandum, Addendum A (explanations of exclusionary periods and final\napproval as opposed to tentative FDA approval). POSTU-139175-10 B. 12 ANDAs as Other Government-Granted Rights that are Not Franchises The September 14, 2011 Memorandum opined:\nPayments to the FDA (a government agency) to obtain the right to\nmarket and sell a new drug in the United States (obtained via FDA\napproval of a NDA or an ANDA, as addressed in Addendum A) would\nbe within Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i). Specifically, an ANDA fits\none [or] more of the non-exclusive list of types of government-granted\nrights that are treated as created intangibles, e.g., \u201clicense, permit,\nfranchise or other similar right granted by that governmental agency.\u201d September 14, 2011 Memorandum, page 41 (footnote omitted). Thus, ANDAs constitute licenses and other similar government granted rights, with\nfranchises just one of the government granted rights that an ANDA falls within for\npurposes of capitalization pursuant to \u00a7 263. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(d)(2)(iii) and \u00a7 197(c)(2) do not exclude licenses, permits or other\nrights granted by a governmental unit from amortizable \u00a7 197 intangibles. Thus, as\ngovernment granted rights other than franchises, ANDAs are still amortizable \u00a7 197\nintangibles. Accordingly, ANDAs as other government granted rights would be\namortized just as would franchises. However, the government\u2019s primary position for\ncost recovery purposes is that ANDAs are franchises, with treatment as other\ngovernment-granted rights an alternative position for purposes of determining cost\nrecovery issues. SECTION II. ANDA TWO AND ANDA THREE As stated in the facts, Corporation X commenced marketing and selling Drug #3 and\nDrug #4 pursuant to a License Y and a License Z, respectively, not pursuant to FDAapproved ANDAs.- While the infringement litigation was settled, the origin of the claim\ntest applies to settlements. See Anchor Coupling v. United States, 427 F.2d 429, 434\n(7th Cir. 1970) (rejected primary purpose test in favor of the origin of the claim test for\nsettlements). See also Commissioner v. Arrowsmith, 193 F.2d 734 (2nd Cir., aff\u2019d, 344\nU.S. 6 (1952), petition for rehearing denied 344 U.S. 900 (1952) (doctrine of relation\nback). The Anchor Coupling Court stated, in rejecting Anchor Coupling\u2019s arguments similar to\nCorporation X\u2019s primary purpose arguments, as follows:\nFurther, for deductibility to depend upon subjective considerations\nencourages schemes of tax avoidance and, as the Supreme Court POSTU-139175-10 13 noted in Gilmore, can lead to capricious results and a concomitant\nlack of uniformity in the application of our tax laws. Finally, as the\nCourt noted in Woodward, a test based upon taxpayer's purpose in\ndefending or settling litigation would encourage resort to\n\u2018formalisms and artificial distinctions.\u2019 427 F.2d at 433 (emphasis added).",
