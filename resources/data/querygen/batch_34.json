Whether the application of Treas.

II. Whether Treas. Reg. \u00a71.267-3(a) is valid as a permissible\nconstruction of the relevant statutory provisions. III. Whether the fact that any interest due under the notes payable was\nnot payable without the approval of the Superintendent of Insurance\nfor the State of --------------, and, as ------------------------ never received\nsuch approval, can the accrued interest even be considered a\ndeductible expense at all because all events have not occurred\nwhich determine the fact of the liability.

Id. at *7. Finally, under the specialized accounting principles applicable to insurance companies,\nthe taxpayer in Southern Family was required to report the \u201ctakeout bonus\u201d payments as\na credit to its capital and surplus account, and not as an item of income or revenue. Id.\nat *6.\nIn AT&T, Inc. v. U.S., No. 09-50651, 2011 WL 9729 (5th Cir. 2011), the court held\nthat the payments were designed to supplement income. Similar to Coastal Utilities, the\nFifth Circuit in AT&T, Inc. examined the policies and mechanisms used to calculate the\ndisbursement amounts. In so doing, the Fifth Circuit determined that the payments\nwere intended to \u201coffset\u201d recipients\u2019 increased cost or lost revenue. Id. at *14. The\ncourt held that under a \u201ctransferor intent\u201d analysis of the factors outlined in Chicago, POSTF-147002-10 8 Burlington & Quincy, supra, the support payments were not intended to be capital\ncontributions. Id. at *20. The taxpayer failed to demonstrate that it \u201cbargained for\u201d the\npayments as the taxpayer merely accepted the unilaterally imposed law and regulations\ndetermining the payments. Id. at *20-21. Further, the taxpayer demonstrated only that\nit participated in the development of the underlying payment program through lobbying\nand advocacy activities. Id. at *21. The Fifth Circuit also found that the payments were\ncompensation for services and that the payment program was the conduit for such\ncompensation. Id. at *21-24. Lastly, the taxpayer failed to demonstrate that the\npayments became a permanent part of its working capital structure as the program did\nnot provide payments exclusively for the specific purpose of making capital\nimprovements. Id. at *24. Analysis of the Intent Underlying the BEA Payments It is our opinion that the BEA payments are not excludable from Taxpayer\u2019s\nincome as nonshareholder capital contributions under section 118. The criteria for\nreceipt of an award, the mechanisms used to calculate the amount of the BEA payment\nat issue, and the unrestricted use of the funds suggest that the BEA payments are not\nproperly viewed as nonshareholder capital contributions under section 118. It is also our opinion that the BEA payments are not intended exclusively for the\nspecific purpose of making capital improvements. The BEA program placed no\nrestrictions or limitations on the recipient\u2019s use of the BEA payments received. In\naddition, the issuance of a Form 1099-G to Taxpayer by the Fund reflects the intent to\ntreat the BEA payments as income and not contributions to capital. Further, Taxpayer\ndid not use the BEA payments to fund any capital improvements or acquire any capital\nassets. Instead, Taxpayer used the BEA payments for general expenses and to provide\nadditional equity investment, lending and deposit activities in distressed communities. For financial accounting purposes, Taxpayer debited general revenue and credited\nretained earnings in the amount of the BEA payments. We have not identified any evidence to indicate that the BEA payments were\nintended to compensate or reimburse Taxpayer solely for any capital investments or\nimprovements.",

How Long Should\nRecords Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items\nappearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and\n1099) until the statute of limitations runs\nout for that return. Usually, this is 3\nyears from the date the return was due or\nfiled or 2 years from the date the tax was\npaid, whichever is later. You should\nkeep some records longer. For example,\nkeep property records (including those\non your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or\nreplacement property. For more details,\nsee chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return\nFile Form 1040-X to change a return\nyou already filed. Generally, Form\n1040-X must be filed within 3 years af- ter the date the original return was filed\nor within 2 years after the date the tax\nwas paid, whichever is later. But you\nmay have more time to file Form\n1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically\nor mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. Use the Where's My Amended Return\napplication on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return. It can take\nup to 3 weeks from the date you mailed\nit to show up in our system. Need a Copy of Your\nTax Return Information? Tax return transcripts are free and are\ngenerally used to validate income and\ntax filing status for mortgage applications, student and small business loan\napplications, and during tax return preparation. To get a free transcript:\n\u2022 Visit IRS.gov/Transcript,\n\u2022 Use Form 4506-T or 4506T-EZ, or\n\u2022 Call us at 800-908-9946. If you need a copy of your actual tax\nreturn, use Form 4506. There is a fee for\neach return requested. See Form 4506\nfor the current fee. If your main home,\nprincipal place of business, or tax records are located in a federally declared\ndisaster area, this fee will be waived. Death of a Taxpayer If a taxpayer died before filing a return\nfor 2022, the taxpayer's spouse or personal representative may have to file and\nsign a return for that taxpayer. A personal representative can be an executor, administrator, or anyone who is in charge\nof the deceased taxpayer's property. If\nthe deceased taxpayer didn't have to file\na return but had tax withheld, a return\nmust be filed to get a refund. The person\nwho files the return must enter \u201cDeceased,\u201d the deceased taxpayer's name,\nand the date of death across the top of\nthe return. If this information isn't provided, it may delay the processing of the\nreturn. If your spouse died in 2022 and you\ndidn't remarry in 2022, or if your spouse\ndied in 2023 before filing a return for\n2022, you can file a joint return. A joint\nreturn should show your spouse's 2022\nincome before death and your income for all of 2022. Enter \u201cFiling as surviving spouse\u201d in the area where you sign\nthe return.",
