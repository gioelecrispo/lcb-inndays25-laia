It costs the\ngovernment less to refund by direct deposit.\n\u2022 It's proven itself. Nearly 98% of\nsocial security and veterans' benefits are\nsent electronically using direct deposit.

You can have your refund (or part\nof it) directly deposited to a traditional\nIRA, Roth IRA, or SEP-IRA, but not a\nSIMPLE IRA. You must establish the\nIRA at a bank or other financial institution before you request direct deposit. Make sure your direct deposit will be\naccepted. You must also notify the trustee or custodian of your account of the\nyear to which the deposit is to be applied\n(unless the trustee or custodian won't accept a deposit for 2022). If you don\u2019t,\nthe trustee or custodian can assume the\ndeposit is for the year during which you\nare filing the return. For example, if you\nfile your 2022 return during 2023 and\ndon\u2019t notify the trustee or custodian in\nadvance, the trustee or custodian can assume the deposit to your IRA is for -57- 2023. If you designate your deposit to be\nfor 2022, you must verify that the deposit was actually made to the account by\nthe due date of the return (not counting\nextensions). If the deposit isn't made by\nthat date, the deposit isn't an IRA contribution for 2022. In that case, you must\nfile an amended 2022 return and reduce\nany IRA deduction and any retirement\nsavings contributions credit you claimed. You and your spouse, if filing\njointly, each may be able to\nCAUTION contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000\nif age 50 or older at the end of 2022) to\na traditional IRA or Roth IRA for 2022. You may owe a penalty if your contributions exceed these limits, and the limits\nmay be lower depending on your compensation and income. For more information on IRA contributions, see Pub. 590-A. !

You can request a\ndeposit of your refund (or part of it) to a\nTreasuryDirect\u00ae online account to buy\nU.S. Treasury marketable securities, if\navailable, and savings bonds. For more\ninformation, go to treasurydirect.gov. Form 8888. You can have your refund\ndirectly deposited into more than one account or use it to buy up to $5,000 in paper series I savings bonds. You don\u2019t\nneed a TreasuryDirect\u00ae account to do\nthis. For more information, see the Form\n8888 instructions.

No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number.

Except\nas otherwise provided in this section, a taxpayer must capitalize-(i) An amount paid to acquire an intangible (see\nparagraph (c) of this section)[39]; 37 The change in litigation position announced in 2002 that cited Lychuk, Chief Counsel Notice CC-2002021, 2002 WL 32813480, addressed employee compensation, fixed overhead and de mimis transaction\ncosts, expenditures not addressed in this advice. The current position of the Commissioner on\ncapitalization is set for the capitalization of intangible regulations as in effect for the years at issue,\nregulations that were originally promulgated in 2004, T.D. 9107, 2004-1 C.B. 447.\n38 Urquhart v. Commissioner, 215 F.2d 17 (3rd Cir. 1954) and Corporation X\u2019s arguments relative Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(9) are addressed in footnote 60, below. 39 Amounts paid to acquire intangibles are not addressed herein since the regulations set forth that to be\nan acquired intangible the taxpayer must have acquired the intangible in a \u201cpurchase or similar\ntransaction.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(c)(1). While \u201cpurchase or similar transaction\u201d is not defined in the\nregulations, reading the -4 regulations as a whole, the regulatory scheme would treat the ANDAs at issue\nas created, not acquired, because the ANDAs were, for example, not acquired from another POSTU-139175-10 39 (ii) An amount paid to create an intangible described in\nparagraph (d) of this section; (iii) An amount paid to create or enhance a separate\nand distinct intangible asset within the meaning of\nparagraph (b)(3) of this section; (iv) An amount paid to create or enhance a future\nbenefit identified in published guidance in the\nFederal Register or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin\n(see \u00a7 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter) as an\nintangible for which capitalization is required under\nthis section; [40] and (v) An amount paid to facilitate (within the meaning of\nparagraph (e)(1) of this section) an acquisition or\ncreation of an intangible described in paragraph\n(b)(1)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(b)(1)(emphasis added). Thus, rather than providing an overall definition of intangibles, the regulations require\ncapitalization of expenditures that are within the categories identified in Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.263(a)-4(b)(1)(i.e., amounts paid to acquire or create an intangible, amounts paid to\ncreate or enhance a separate and distinct intangible and amounts paid to facilitate an\nacquisition or creation of an intangible, if within the subsections cross-referenced by\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(b)(1)) and not specifically exempted from capitalization (e.g.,\nthe 12-month rule).
