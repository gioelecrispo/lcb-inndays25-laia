    "text": "Thus, the CSED has\nexpired for the partnership taxes and the Service cannot collect\nthe liability from either the partnership or the general partners\n(due to their derivative liability for the employment taxes). Pursuant to Galletti, with regard to the civil penalty, because\nthe CSED has not yet expired, the civil penalty is able to be\ncollected from the general partners since they are derivatively\nliable for the assessments against the partnership. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, it is Counsel\u2019s opinion that an OIC\nfiled by general partners for their derivative liability for a\npartnership tax liability does not suspend the CSED as to the\npartnership tax liability. Additionally, when the CSED expired\nas to the partnership, it also expired as to the general\npartners, even though the general partners filed an OIC. Regarding the civil penalty for which the CSED has not expired in\nthis case, the general partners are derivatively liable for the\nassessment. page 6 CC:SB:8:LA:3:POSTF-162737-03 At this time, we are closing our file in this matter.

Requirements for an\nElectronic Return To file your return electronically, you\nmust sign the return electronically using\na personal identification number (PIN)\nand provide the information described\nbelow. If you are filing online using\nsoftware, you must use a Self-Select\nPIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a\nSelf-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. For 2022, if we issued you an identity\nprotection personal identification number (IP PIN) (as described in more detail\nbelow), all six digits of your IP PIN\nmust appear in the IP PIN spaces provi- ded next to the space for your occupation for your electronic signature to be\ncomplete. Failure to include an issued IP\nPIN on the electronic return will result\nin an invalid signature and a rejected return. If you are filing a joint return and\nboth taxpayers were issued an IP PIN,\nenter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN\nmethod allows you to create your own\nPIN. If you are married filing jointly,\nyou and your spouse will each need to\ncreate a PIN and enter these PINs as\nyour electronic signatures. A PIN is any combination of five digits you choose except five zeros. If you\nuse a PIN, there is nothing to sign and\nnothing to mail\u2014not even your Forms\nW-2. Your electronic return is considered a\nvalidly signed return only when it includes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your adjusted gross income (AGI) from your\noriginally filed 2021 federal income tax\nreturn, if applicable. If you're filing\njointly, your electronic return must also\ninclude your spouse's PIN, last name,\ndate of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and\nAGI, if applicable, in order to be considered validly signed. Don\u2019t use your AGI\nfrom an amended return (Form 1040-X)\nor a math error correction made by the\nIRS. AGI is the amount shown on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. If\nyou don\u2019t have your 2021 income tax return, call the IRS at 800-908-9946 to get\na free transcript of your return or visit\nIRS.gov/Transcript. (If you filed electronically last year, you, and your\nspouse if filing jointly, may use your\nprior year PIN to verify your identity instead of your prior year AGI. The prior\nyear PIN is the five-digit PIN you used\nto electronically sign your 2021 return.) You can't use the Self-Select\nPIN method if you are a\nCAUTION first-time filer under age 16 at\nthe end of 2022. ! Practitioner PIN. The Practitioner PIN\nmethod allows you to authorize your tax\npractitioner to enter or generate your\nPIN. Your electronic return is considered a validly signed return only when it\nincludes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, and IP PIN, if applicable. If you're -61- filing jointly, your electronic return must\nalso include your spouse's PIN, last\nname, date of birth, and IP PIN, if applicable in order to be considered validly\nsigned. The practitioner can provide you\nwith details. Form 8453. You must send in a paper\nForm 8453 if you have to attach certain\nforms or other documents that can't be\nelectronically filed.
