    "text": "U.S. v.\nChicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R., 412 U.S. 401, 411 (1973). The Supreme Court\nreasoned that \u201cthe decisional distinction between Detroit Edison and Brown Shoe Co.\nrested upon the nature of the benefit to the transferor, rather than the transferee\u201d. Id. The Supreme Court also identified five characteristics of a nonshareholder contribution\nto capital: (1) the contribution must become a permanent part of the transferee's\nworking capital structure; (2) the contribution must not be compensation for specific,\nquantifiable service provided; (3) the contribution must be bargained for; (4) the\ncontributed asset must foreseeably result in benefit to the transferee in an amount\ncommensurate with its value; and (5) the contributed asset will be ordinarily employed in\nor contribute to the production of additional income and value assured in that respect. Id. at 413. POSTF-147002-10 7 More Recent Decisions Addressing Transferor Intent or Motive\nIn U.S. v. Coastal Utilities, Inc., 483 F. Supp. 2d 1232 (S.D. Ga. 2007), aff'd, 514\nF.3d 1184 (11th Cir. 2008), the court held that government payments to a\ntelecommunications provider for services provided in high cost areas were not capital\ncontributions under section 118. Based upon its analysis of the mechanisms used to\ncalculate the amount of the payments at issue, the court determined that the purpose of\nthe payments was to supplement income. Id. The court reasoned that although the\namount of the payments were largely based on investment expenditures, the\ncalculations also took into consideration revenue requirements and expenses unrelated\nto investment expenditures. Id. at 1241-42. The court rejected the taxpayer\u2019s argument\nthat the government received a direct benefit in return for the payment as \u201cit does not\nfollow that a government payment is a contribution to capital every time a public\npurpose is in some way implicated\u2026all government spending should, theoretically, and\nat least indirectly, be for the purpose of benefiting the community.\u201d Id. at 1245. Lastly,\nthe court reasoned that the payments were intended to provide an enhanced return on\ninvestments previously made, as opposed to payments to make capital investments. Id.\nat 1246-48. A Florida district court recently held that \u201ctakeout bonus\u201d payments made by the\nState of Florida to insurers for assuming property insurance risks were non-shareholder\ncontributions to capital and excluded from gross income. Southern Family Insurance\nCompany v. U.S., No. 8:05-cv-2158-T-30MAP, 2010 WL 4974612 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 1,\n2010). The court in Southern Family found as fact that the \u201ctakeout bonus\u201d payments to\nthe insurers for assuming property insurance risks were not based on any consideration\nof, or desire to provide, increased revenue or return on the insurers\u2019 investments. Id. at\n*1. The court observed that the amount of the \u201ctakeout bonus\u201d payments did not\ndepend on the value of the insured property, the insurance premium, or the insurer\u2019s\nexpected profit from the policy. Id. The court looked to the applicable Florida statute\nauthorizing the \u201ctakeout bonus\u201d payments in finding that the payments were intended by\nthe legislature to be contributions to the insurer\u2019s capital, not income. Id. at *6. Moreover, the evidence established that the insurers and the State of Florida engaged\nin negotiations concerning the \u201ctakeout bonus\u201d payment arrangements. Id. at *7.",

    "text": "Although the mere presence of an incidental future\nbenefit - \u201csome future aspect\u201d - may not warrant capitalization, a\ntaxpayer's realization of benefits beyond the year in which the\nexpenditure is incurred is undeniably important in determining\nwhether the appropriate tax treatment is immediate deduction or\ncapitalization. Indopco, 503 U.S. at 87 (citations and footnote omitted)(emphasis added). Accordingly, based on general capitalization principles articulated in Lincoln Savings\nand Indopco, an expenditure that creates or enhances a separate and distinct asset is\ncapitalizable, but the expenditure may still be capitalizable even if it does not create or\nenhance a separate and distinct asset. Determining whether the expenditures at issue must be capitalized as within I.R.C.\n\u00a7 263 (rather than deducted under \u00a7 16218 or excluded from capitalization under I.R.C.\n\u00a7 17419) requires a two step analysis. In the first step, addressed in Section I, below,\n18 I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a) allows a deduction for ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during a\ntaxable year in carrying on a trade or business. \u201cTo qualify as an allowable deduction under \u00a7 162(a), an\nitem must be: (1) \u2018be paid or incurred during the taxable year\u2019; (2) be for \u2018carrying on any trade or\nbusiness\u2019; (3) be an \u2018expense\u2019; (4) be a \u2018necessary\u2019 expense; and (5) be an \u2018ordinary expense\u2019. Commissioner v. Lincoln Savings & Loan Ass\u2019n, 403 U.S. 345, 352 (1971) (citations omitted). However,\nthe Lincoln Savings Court cautioned that \u201c[i]t is not enough, in order that an expenditure qualify as an\nincome tax deduction, that it merely be . . . paid by all similarly [situated taxpayers], or that it serves to\nfortify . . . purpose and operation.\u201d 403 U.S. at 354. The Court then held that the expenditure at issue\nwas not deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense because it created or enhanced an\n\u201cadditional asset and that, as an inevitable consequence, the payment is capital in nature.\u201d 403 U.S. at\n354 (emphasis added). 19 Expenditures within the twelve code sections listed in I.R.C. \u00a7 263(a)(1) are not within the mandate of\ncapitalization in I.R.C. \u00a7 263(a), with one of the listed code sections I.R.C. \u00a7 174. The fees at issue are\nnot within \u00a7 174 because the fees were incurred to acquire the right to market and sell Corporation X\u2019s\ngeneric drugs prior to the expiration of the patents on the branded drugs the generic drugs \u201cmimic.\u201d The\nsubstantial fees incurred to prepare for a paragraph IV certification (paragraph IV certifications are\nexplained in Addendum A) and to defend the paragraph IV certification in infringement litigation in order to\nexpedite commercialization of the already developed generic drugs are not minor costs incurred in\n\u201cconnection with inventions or improvements from research and development in the experimental or\nlaboratory sense undertaken directly by the taxpayer or carried on in his behalf by another person or\norganization,\u201d as required to be within \u00a7 174.
