    "text": "Finally, the use of inconsistent methods for valuing assets producing income\nfrom foreign sources and the use of a different method to value assets producing U.S.\nsource income would result in a skewed apportionment of interest expense. For this\nreason, the regulations require that apportionment of interest expense be made either\non the basis of the tax book value or the fair market value with respect to all assets. As a result of the foregoing, we have no doubt that the facts portray the failure on\nthe part of the taxpayer to establish the fair market value of its assets. Your conclusion\nto the same effect is well justified. Issue 2:\nIn considering whether the facts at hand justify putting the taxpayer on the tax\nbook value method of apportionment, one only needs to look at the flawed methodology POSFTF-123604-02 8 used by the taxpayer to reach a conclusion. Neither the methodology used for\nassigning a fair market value to domestic assets nor the separate methodology used for\nassigning a fair market value to foreign assets is accurate. Both methodologies used\nare flawed. The taxpayer has failed to establish the fair market value of any of its\nassets, domestic or foreign. 4 As a result, the taxpayer has failed to establish the value\nof a \"substantial portion\" of its assets to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, and the\nCommissioner may require the taxpayer to use the tax book value method of\napportionment. Treas. Reg. ' 1.861-9T(g)(1)(iii). Conclusions: The shortcomings discussed above are sufficient in magnitude and importance to\njustify the conclusion that the taxpayer failed to establish the fair market value of its\nassets to the satisfaction of the Commissioner. Moreover, because the taxpayer failed\nto establish the fair market value of any of its assets, it is appropriate to conclude that\nthe taxpayer failed to establish the value of a \"substantial portion\" of its assets to the\nsatisfaction of the Commissioner, justifying the requirement that the taxpayer use the\ntax book value method of apportionment, consistent with Treas. Reg. ' 1.8619T(g)(1)(iii). DISCLOSURE STATEMENT This writing may contain privileged information.

    "text": "In fact, the evidence clearly shows the opposite. The\nevidence, both as to form, substance, and intent of the parties, is of completed contracts\nfor b purchases. The fact that these transactions are completed purchases never\nintended to be per unit retains for the taxable year 20--- is, conclusively, evidenced by\nthe fact that the Coop admits that none of the contracting parties ever considered or\ntreated the transaction as anything but a completed sale. The taxpayer admits that\nthese b purchases have historically been treated as purchases, were treated as\npurchases during the year 20---, and have been treated as purchases up to the time of\nthe claim for refund. The after the fact October 20----memorandum, a unilateral,\nuntimely act by the Coop, does not remediate the missing mutual agreement. POSTF-143023-10 22 We do not interpret the 20--- PLR to hold that b purchases can be treated as\npurchases and then modified to per unit retains, to the detriment of the members and\nparticipating patrons. We further do not interpret the 20--- PLR to hold that the b\npurchases can be treated as purchases and then modified to per unit retains at the sole\ndiscretion of the Coop, without a timely agreement from the Coop\u2019s members and\nparticipating patrons. We further do not interpret the 20--- PLR to hold that the b\npurchases can be treated as purchases and then modified to per-unit retains for the\nyear 20---, for which tax returns have already been filed and when the year is closed for\nmost, if not all of the parties to the b purchase (except, for the Coop). To change the\noriginal reported treatment would disregard the undisputed form of the transaction, the\nsubstance of the transaction, and the admitted clear intent and expectations of the\ncontracting parties to the b transaction. We believe that there is no evidence that would contradict that the member or\nparticipating patron had an enforceable, contractual right and expectation that he would\nretain the full proceeds from the b sale. The member or participating patron did not\nreceive a per-unit retain payment for its commodity, that may be or may not be altered,\ndepending on the final Coop\u2019s unilateral decision, or at a later time. They exchanged b\nfor consideration (the b sale proceeds). This consideration was the Coop\u2019s members\nand participating patrons to keep, regardless of the ultimate disposition of the b, i.e., at\na profit or at a loss, by the Coop. We further believe that there is no authority in the Code, or regulations issued\nthere under, that requires the Service to allow a reclassification of a b purchase to a per\nunit retain, when it ignores the contractual understanding of a legal contract between\nthe parties, acts to the detriment of the members or participating patrons who have\nalready reported the transactions as purchases, and whose taxable year are now\nclosed. Further, the fact that the terms of the purchase can be interpreted to fit the\ndefinition of per-unit retains in the Code does not mean that a purchase and a per-unit\nretain are one and the same.",

At that\ntime, the taxpayer\u2019s facility met all of the above requirements to be a qualified small\npower production facility. Between Year 2 and Year 4, the taxpayer replaced all the equipment in the selfcertified facility. Despite the replacement, a change in facts from those presented in a\nnotice of self-certification or an application for Commission certification does not mean\nthat the facility is no longer a qualified facility. Mesquite Lake Associates, Ltd., 63\nFERC \u00b6 61,351 (June 30, 1993). Whether the facility will continue to be certified after a\nchange in facts depends on whether the facility continues to satisfy the ownership and\ntechnical requirements for qualifying status found in the statute and the Commission\u2019s\nregulations. Id. Despite the replacement, the taxpayer\u2019s facility continued to satisfy the\nownership and technical requirements for qualifying status set forth in 18 C.F.R.\n\u00a7\u00a7 292.203; 292.204.2\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A\ncogeneration facility produces electricity and steam or forms of useful energy (such as\nheat) which are used for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes. 16 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 796(18)(A). A qualifying cogeneration facility is a cogeneration facility that the FERC\ndetermines, by rule, meets the requirements the FERC prescribed. 16 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 796(18)(B). The taxpayer agrees that its power operation is a qualified cogeneration\nfacility, however, the taxpayer disagrees that it is not also a qualified small power\nproduction facility. There is no rule in either 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796 or the associated regulations which,\nexpressly or impliedly, states that if a facility is a cogeneration facility it is excluded from\nthe definition of a small power production facility. In fact, in a 1996 Order concerning\ncertification the FERC ruled that, based on the facts presented, a facility could be both a\nqualified small production facility and a qualified cogeneration facility. Burney Forest\nProducts, 76 FERC \u00b6 62,263 (September 30, 1996). The facility at issue in the Order\nconsisted of two wood-fired boilers and an extraction/condensing steam turbine\ngenerator. Id. The thermal output of the facility was used to dry lumber as well as\ncreate electricity. Id. The wood used in the facility was considered biomass and the\nmaximum net electric power production capacity of the facility was 31.5 megawatts. Id. Since the fuel was a biomass and the size of the power production capacity was less\nthan 80 megawatts, the facility met the definition of a small power production facility. Id. Since the thermal output both created electricity and dried the lumber, it was also a\ncogeneration facility. Id.\n2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- POSTF-132138-11 -6- The definitions themselves suggest that the classifications are not mutually\nexclusive. The crux of the definition of a qualified small power production facility is the\nsize of the facility (based on power output) and the type of fuel used. The crux of the\ndefinition of a qualified cogeneration facility is the method in which the electricity is\nproduced and the efficiency standards of that method. Thus, a plain reading of 16\nU.S.C. \u00a7 796(17) and (18) suggests that a facility could be both a qualified small power\nproduction facility and a qualified cogeneration facility. 3",

Analysis\n(a) With respect to amortization of investigatory expenses, does\n' 195 apply only to creating a new business or acquiring a\nbusiness in a field that differs from the acquirer\u2019s existing\nbusiness? Under the Internal Revenue Code, investigatory expenses, as\npart of startup expenditures,2 are amortizable over 60 months,\nwhich, compared with capitalization, is more favorable to\ntaxpayers. See I.R.C. ' 195(b). Under \u00a7 195, investigatory expenses refers to any amount(A) paid or incurred in connection with(i) investigating the creation or acquisition\nof an\nactive trade or business,\n... ...\n(B) which, if paid or incurred in connection with the\noperation of an existing active trade or business (in\nthe same field as the trade or business referred to in\nsubparagraph (A)), would be allowable as a deduction\nfor the taxable year in which paid or incurred. I.R.C. ' 195(c)(1). (I.R.C. ' 195(c)(1)(A) and I.R.C.\n' 195(c)(1)(B) hereinafter are sometimes referred to as\nAsubparagraph (A)@ and Asubparagraph (B)@ respectively.) 2 \u00a7 195 addresses startup expenditures, which includes investigatory expenses\nand startup costs. See discussion infra in this Analysis. CC:LM:NR:HOU:2: POSTF 163829-02 page 4 Whether this statute applies to the acquisition of an\nexisting business in the same field as the acquirer\u2019s depends on\nthe meaning of Aactive trade or business@ in subparagraph (A)(i)3. Neither Subparagraph (A) nor (B) defines Aactive trade or\nbusiness.@ These two subparagraphs, however, shed much light on\nthe term\u2019s meaning when looked at together. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) together, in pertinent parts,\nstate that, in addition to \u201cin connection with\u201d investigating the\ncreation or acquisition of an active trade or business, a startup\nexpenditure is an expense that would be currently deductible, if\nit were paid or incurred in connection with the operation of an\nexisting trade or business which is in the same field as that of\nthe one created or acquired. To illustrate, suppose A creates or acquires B, an active\ntrade or business in field X. A\u2019s startup expenditures,\nincluding the expenses incurred in connection with investigating\nthe creation or acquisition of B, must be such that, if incurred\nin connection with the operation of an existing business in field\nX, are currently deductible. Whether an expense is currently deductible is controlled by\nI.R.C. ' 162, which provides that only ordinary and necessary\nexpenses are currently deductible. What kind of expenses, then,\npaid or incurred in connection with investigating the creation or\nacquisition of B could have been incurred in connection with\noperating an existing business in field X and currently\ndeductible? Such expenses are not identifiable, or even\nconceivable, from the plain language of ' 195(c), although such\nidentification is crucial to the ultimate issue in this case. \u201cIn the absence of a legislative definition, the term must\nbe given a meaning consistent with the overall statutory\ncontext.\u201d Doe v. Rowe, 156 F. Supp. 2d 35, 46-47 (D. Me. 2001). 3 Of subparagraph (A), only (i) is relevant to the present case. CC:LM:NR:HOU:2: POSTF 163829-02 page 5 Section 195 was enacted in 1980.",

Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule\n3, line 2). 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part\nIII). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number. You must enter each dependent's social security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered\nagree with the dependent's social security card.",
