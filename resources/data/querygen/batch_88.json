The practitioner, however, must provide the\nclient with reasonable access to review and copy\nany additional records of the client retained by the\npractitioner under state law that are necessary for the\nclient to comply with his or her Federal tax obligations.

The suitability check will be limited to an inquiry\nregarding whether an applicant has engaged in any\nconduct that would justify suspension or disbarment\nof any practitioner under the provisions of this part\non the date the application is submitted, including\nwhether the applicant has engaged in disreputable\nconduct as defined in \u00a710.51. The application will\nbe denied only if the results of the compliance or\nsuitability check are sufficient to establish that the\npractitioner engaged in conduct subject to sanctions\nunder \u00a7\u00a710.51 and 10.52. (2) If the applicant does not pass the tax\ncompliance or suitability check, the applicant will\nnot be issued an enrollment or registration card or\ncertificate pursuant to \u00a710.6(b) of this part.

Section 530 Relief\nA. General Explanation\nSection 530(a)(1) of the 1978 Act, as amended by the Tax Equity and Fiscal\nResponsibility Act of 1982, provides, in part, that if, for purposes of employment taxes,\nthe taxpayer did not treat an individual as an employee for any period, then for purposes\nof applying such taxes for such period with respect to the taxpayer the individual shall\nbe deemed not to be an employee unless the taxpayer had no reasonable basis for not\ntreating the individual as an employee. For any period after December 31, 1978, this\nrelief applies only if both of the following consistency rules are satisfied: (1) all federal\ntax returns (including information returns) required to be filed by the taxpayer with\nrespect to the individual for the period are filed on a basis consistent with the taxpayer's\ntreatment of the individual as not being an employee (\u201creporting consistency rule\u201d), and\n(2) the taxpayer (and any predecessor) has not treated any individual holding a\nsubstantially similar position as an employee for purposes of the employment taxes for\nperiods beginning after December 31, 1977 (\u201csubstantive consistency rule\u201d). Section\n530(c)(1) of the 1978 Act defines the term \u201cemployment tax\u201d as any tax imposed by\nSubtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code, including FICA, FUTA, and income tax\nwithholding requirements. When section 530 was enacted, state and local employers were not subject to taxation\nunder either the FICA or the FUTA. Section 3121(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code\nexcluded services for such entities from FICA taxes. For FUTA purposes, section\n3306(c)(7) excluded (and continues to exclude) from employment services performed in\nthe employ of a state, or any political subdivision thereof. Although services for state and local governments were excluded from the definition of\n\u201cemployment\u201d in the FICA by section 3121(b)(7) of the Code, social security coverage\nfor such services could be obtained through a section 218 agreement. Social security\ncontributions made with respect to the agreements were not FICA taxes. The\nregulations relating to the payments and reports of such social security contributions\nwere under the jurisdiction of the Social Security Administration (SSA). At the time of\npassage of section 530, 42 U.S.C. section 418(e)(1)(A) provided that section 218\nagreements shall provide:\n[T]hat the State will pay to the Secretary of the Treasury, at such time or times\nas the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare may by regulations prescribe,\namounts equivalent to the sum of the taxes which would be imposed by sections\n1400 and 1410 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 [the predecessors of\nsections 3101 and 3111 of the 1986 Code], if the services of employees covered POSTF-123043-08 14",

You no longer need to be TIP younger than age 701/2 to take\na deduction for your contributions to an IRA. If you made contributions to a traditional IRA for 2022, you may be able to\ntake an IRA deduction. But you, or your\nspouse if filing a joint return, must have\nhad earned income to do so. For IRA\npurposes, earned income includes alimony and separate maintenance payments\nreported on Schedule 1, line 2a. If you\nwere a member of the U.S. Armed\nForces, earned income includes any nontaxable combat pay you received. If you\nwere self-employed, earned income is\ngenerally your net earnings from\nself-employment if your personal services were a material income-producing\nfactor. For more details, see Pub. 590-A. A statement should be sent to you by\nMay 31, 2023, that shows all contributions to your traditional IRA for 2022. Use the IRA Deduction Worksheet to\nfigure the amount, if any, of your IRA\ndeduction. But read the following list\nbefore you fill in the worksheet. 1. You can't deduct contributions to\na Roth IRA.

If you are filing a joint return and\nyou or your spouse made contributions\nto both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA\nfor 2022, don\u2019t use the IRA Deduction\nWorksheet in these instructions. Instead,\nsee Pub. 590-A to figure the amount, if\nany, of your IRA deduction. 3. You can\u2019t deduct elective deferrals to a 401(k) plan, 403(b) plan, section 457 plan, SIMPLE plan, or the federal Thrift Savings Plan. These amounts\naren't included as income in box 1 of\nyour Form W-2. 4. If you made contributions to your\nIRA in 2022 that you deducted for 2021,\ndon\u2019t include them in the worksheet. 5. If you received income from a\nnonqualified deferred compensation\nplan or nongovernmental section 457\nplan that is included in box 1 of your\nForm W-2, or in box 1 of Form\n1099-NEC, don\u2019t include that income on\nline 8 of the worksheet.

In the event that money is contributed by a nonshareholder,\nthen any property acquired with the money during the following 12 months shall have its\nbasis reduced by the amount of the contribution. I.R.C. \u00a7 362(c)(2). Here, Taxpayer did\nnot reduce the basis of any assets under section 362(c) but now argues that it should\nhave reduced the basis of loans it issued during the years at issue. Notwithstanding the\nquestion of whether Taxpayer can reduce the basis of loans, it is clear that the\nTaxpayer did not comply with section 362(c). For the foregoing reasons, it is our opinion that the BEA payments made to\nTaxpayer by the Fund during the taxable years ended *** a and *** b do not satisfy the\nrequirements to be treated as a nonshareholder contribution to capital under section\n118. The criteria for receipt of the BEA payment, the mechanisms used to calculate the\namount of the BEA payment, and the unrestricted use of the BEA funds suggest the\npurpose of the BEA payment is to supplement revenue of the recipient for qualified\nactivities. Further, the BEA payments do not satisfy the characteristics of a\nnonshareholder contribution to capital as established by the Supreme Court. Therefore,\nthe BEA payments are not excluded from Taxpayer\u2019s gross income under section 118. Accordingly, it is our opinion that BEA payments are includible in Taxpayer\u2019s gross\nincome in the amount of the BEA payments received during the taxable years ended ***\na and *** b.
