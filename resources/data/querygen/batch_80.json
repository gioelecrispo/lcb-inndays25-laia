    "text": "Brown v.\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 1970-253. Only the promotion of the company and its products\nqualify for deduction under \u00a7 162(a). The company has attempted to link the two, stating\nthat the company:\nprojects an image of a unique family culture founded on principles and\nvalues . . . [that] the *** aj represents the spirit of family, the spirit of\nadventure, and the spirit of leadership\u2014- all values that are part of who we\nare as a company . . . it highlights *** Taxpayer\u2019s family company\nmessage and celebrates its history . . . *** Taxpayer has qualified research\nshowing that consumers would rather buy from a family-owned business. .\n.. Creating an environment where emotional connections with the *** ah\nfamily and a sense of pride among employees are also very helpful in\ncreating a stronger, more vibrant company. We believe that any promotion of the good reputation of the *** ah family that may have\nresulted from the *** al -------------- is too remote from the promotion of the company and its\nproducts to qualify as a corporate advertising deduction. The taxpayer has referred to Poletti v. Commissioner, 330 F.2d 818 (8th Cir. 1964), in\nsupport of its deduction. In that case, the taxpayer ran an employment agency and gave\nfree gifts, both to individuals who sought placement through the agency and to companies\nwhere it placed employees. The court held such expenditures deductible, noting that a\ntaxpayer \u201cshould not be penalized taxwise for business ingenuity in utilizing advertising\ntechniques which do not conform to the practices of one whom he is naturally trying to\nsurpass in profits.\u201d Though this precedent no doubt endorses creativity in advertising, we do not believe it\nsupports the deduction at issue. Unlike Poletti, where it was obvious that the expenditure,\nthough unconventional, benefitted the company, the taxpayer here has not proven that the\nexpenditure resulted in any useful promotional communication to potential customers, or\nwas intended to do so, at least not on a scale commensurate to the size of the expenditure. Furthermore, the elements of personal pleasure cannot be ignored. Although we do not\ndoubt that the *** al -------------- had some historic element, the photographs and\ndescriptions of the --------------, as provided to the Service by the taxpayer, indicate that the CC:LM:RFPH:CHI:2:M:POSTF-130690-11 Page 9 president of the company, his mother, and other relatives enjoyed many recreational\namenities on this --------------, including diving, sailing, swimming, and other diversions. As\nnumerous judicial opinions indicate, these factors weigh in favor of a finding that the\nexpenses are non-deductible as \u201cpersonal, living, or family expenses\u201d under \u00a7 262 and\nagainst a finding of a business purpose under \u00a7 162(a). The fact that the expenses of five1\nfamily members who travelled on the expedition were not deducted on the corporate return\nsuggests that the expedition was primarily a family recreational event and not primarily\nbusiness-related.",

    "text": "Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(f). However, limited partners and corporate general partners\nwith a less-than-ten-percent partnership interest are excepted\nfrom aggregate treatment. In cases involving less-than-10percent limited or general partners, subsection (e)(4) treats the\npartnership as an entity for interest apportionment purposes. Moreover, subsection (e)(4)(i) provides that a limited partner or\n2 Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-8T(c)(2) defines the term \u201crelated\npersons\u201c to mean two or more persons in a relationship described\nin section 267(b). CC:LM:HMT:CIN:1:POSTF-168001-03 Page 6 corporate general partner whose interest in the partnership is\nless than 10 percent shall directly allocate its distributive\nshare of partnership interest expense to its distributive share\nof partnership gross income. Subject to certain exceptions, such\na partner\u2019s distributive share of foreign source income from the\npartnership is generally treated as passive income. A partner\u2019s\nshare of partnership interest expense, other than certain\ninterest expense directly allocated to specific partnership\nproperty, is allocated among the relevant groupings of\npartnership gross income solely on the basis of the partnership\u2019s\nrelative gross income in each grouping. Finally, for purposes of\nallocating other interest expense incurred directly by the\npartner, subsection (e)(4)(ii) explicitly provides that the\nrelevant asset is the partner\u2019s interest in the partnership,\nrather than the partner\u2019s share of the partnership assets. It is important to recognize that the rules of Treas. Reg. \u00a7\n1.861-9T(e)(4), requiring partnership-level allocations of\npartnership interest expense for partners with small percentage\ninterests, is a rule of administrative convenience. That is,\nless than-ten-percent interests are generally considered passive\nportfolio investments. Generally, such partners have little or\nno say-so in management or financing decisions of the\npartnership. It will frequently be simpler and cheaper for these\npartners to have the partnership compute a single allocation\nbased solely on partnership items. CC:LM:HMT:CIN:1:POSTF-168001-03 Page 7 Application Here, the D report calculated the fair market value of the\nassets of B. Nevertheless, the TAXPAYER, by proffering the C\nmemorandum, is suggesting that the asset which it was required to\nvalue was the P interest in the B partnership, not the fair\nmarket value of the partnership assets. In that regard, on February 11, 2004, TAXPAYER provided its\nposition on this issue (see copy attached). According to\nTAXPAYER:\nIn filing its US Federal income tax return, TAXPAYER took\nthe position that Treas. Reg. 1.861-9T(h) provides\nauthoritative guidance as to the procedures to apportion\ninterest expense under the fair market value method. It was\nTAXPAYER\u2019s position that, to the extent that 1.861-9T(h)\nprovides guidance for computational matters, this\nregulation should control over other provisions (such as\nTreas. Reg. 1.861-9T(e)). Treasury Regulation 1.861-9T(h)\naffirmatively states that the apportionment should be based\non the aggregate fair market value of the assets of the\nTAXPAYER and its pro rata share of assets held by related\npersons. Because TAXPAYER does not own more than 50% in the\nB partnership, B should not be treated as a related person\nfor purposes of these regulations (see below). Applying\nthe \u201c10% rule\u201d of Temp. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(e)(2) to the B fact\npattern would result in a different computation than the\none that is seemingly prescribed by the authority of Treas. Reg. 1.861-10T(h), which establishes a 50% and not a 10%\nownership threshold for determining whether the TAXPAYER\nshould use the FMV of its investment vs. the FMV of the\nTAXPAYER\u2019s distributive share of another entity\u2019s assets\nfor interest apportionment.",

If they don\u2019t, certain deductions\nand credits on Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nmay be reduced or disallowed and you\nmay not receive credit for your social\nsecurity earnings. If your Form W-2\nshows an incorrect SSN or name, notify\nyour employer or the form-issuing agent\nas soon as possible to make sure your\nearnings are credited to your social security record. If the name or SSN on\nyour social security card is incorrect,\ncall the SSA. Once you are issued an SSN, use it to\nfile your tax return. Use your SSN to file -14- your tax return even if your SSN does\nnot authorize employment or if you have\nbeen issued an SSN that authorizes employment and you lose your employment authorization.

IRS Individual Taxpayer\nIdentification Numbers\n(ITINs) for Aliens If you are a nonresident or resident alien\nand you don\u2019t have and aren\u2019t eligible to\nget an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN.

If you\nhaven't used your ITIN on a federal tax\nreturn at least once for tax years 2019,\n2020, or 2021, it expired at the end of\n2022 and must be renewed if you need\nto file a federal tax return in 2023.

    "text": "Corp F continues to\nrun its Industry N business using its retained rights in the assets. Thus, in substance,\nthere was no asset sale for tax purposes. As stated in Estate of Franklin v.\nCommissioner, 64 T.C. 752 (1975), aff\u2019g Estate of Franklin v. Commissioner, 544 F.2d\n1045, 1047 n.1 (1976):\n\u201c[W]hile characteristics of a transaction are questions of fact,\nwhether those characteristics constitute a sale for tax\npurposes is a question of law\u201d (emphasis in original, citations\nomitted) To paraphrase the reasoning in Estate of Franklin, the lack of a price that\napproximately equals the fair market value leaves the transaction lacking the substance\nto justify treating the transaction as a sale ab initio. 544 F.2d at 1048. Whether or not\nCorp F (through Owners 1, 2 and 3) believed that the businesses formerly acquired by\nEntity G could be worth $ DD after the bankruptcy, there is no evidence the few assets\nfrom the business that Corp F allegedly sold could be worth $ DD at the time of the\npurported sale. The fact the \u201csold\u201d assets were purchased for approximately $ R ($ T\nless retained W) 23 in an arms length, open bid, hotly contested auction ** months\nearlier is compelling evidence that the assets were only worth $ R. If Corp F could not\nmake a go of the business without the Z that a non-profit organization could command,\nthat is additional evidence the value did not increase over $ EE24 in the intervening **\nmonths that Corp F held the assets. Moreover, while Corp F asserts that the increased value ($ EE) is either going\nconcern or goodwill, the evidence is to the contrary. As noted above, Corp F allegedly\ncould not make a \u201cgo\u201d of the business without Entity M. From a review of the list of\nshort-term AA contracts, it appears that the AA contracts are old or relatively few. Most\nof the BB agreements and ZZ contracts pre-date the purchase of the assets in the\nbankruptcy auction. All ZZ were released from their non-compete clauses prior to the\nbankruptcy auction. It will take future development to turn these assets into a $ DD\nbusiness, if such a success is possible. To the extent Corp F is anticipating creating\ngoodwill by running the business through Entity M for P years that does not bring Year\n10 value to the purported sale of miscellaneous older assets. 23 The $ R is, in exact amounts, $ R. This amount is based on Corp F\u2019s representation it paid $ T for all of\nthe assets acquired in the bankruptcy auction with $ GG of said $ T paid for the W. The W were retained\nby Corp F. If the amount allocated to the W was not a negotiated arms length amount, said amount may\nbe too low of an allocation because W are probably the most valuable asset acquired. 24 $ DD less $ R. Page 25 of 37 POSTF-134629-07 Similar to taxpayer in Estate of Franklin, Corp F failed to provide any support for\nits conclusion that the $ DD purchase price was at least approximately equivalent to the\nfair market value of the assets sold.",

    "text": "3. Application to TAXPAYER Group Interest Expense / No Guidance to Dictate Deviating\nfrom the General Rule The regulations contain an example showing how interest expense incurred outside the\npartnership by a less than 10 percent corporate partner is to be apportioned. No guidance is\nprovided, however, for the apportionment of interest expense incurred outside of the partnership\nthe case of a greater than 10 percent corporate partner (as noted further below, guidance is\nprovided, however, for apportioning interest expense incurred inside the partnership in the case\nof a more than 10 percent corporate partner). See Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(e)(6), Example\n(iii) and (iv). Therefore, in accordance with the plain language of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(a) and (g), the assets\nto be taken into account for apportionment purposes with respect to interest expense incurred\ndirectly by the TAXPAYER Group should be those assets held directly by a taxpayer. Based on\nthe general rules described above, again for purposes of apportioning interest expense incurred\ndirectly by the TAXPAYER Group, the \u201cassets of the taxpayer\u201d should include the FMV of\nTAXPAYER\u2019s partnership interest in B partnership. 4. Application to TAXPAYER\u2019s Distributive Share of B Interest Expense / Guidance to Use\nAggregate Theory As noted above, the interest expense apportionment rules under section 864(e) include special\nrules applicable to partnerships. Those rules are limited in scope, however, and should not be\napplicable to the interest expense directly incurred by a controlling corporate partner outside of CC:LM:HMT:CIN:1:POSTF-168001-03 Page 13 the partnership.8 In relevant part, Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(e)(2) provides a special rule that requires a\ncorporate partner that directly or through section 318 attribution owns 10 percent or more of a\npartnership to allocate its distributive share of a partnership\u2019s interest expense on a combined\ngross asset basis. Under this special rule, a partnership is treated as an \u201caggregate\u201d in that the\ncorporate partner\u2019s distributive share of partnership interest expense must be allocated based on\nthe sum of the average assets held directly by the partner and the partner\u2019s pro rata share\n(determined by reference to the partner\u2019s interest in partnership income for the year) of the\naverage assets held by the partnership.9 This \u201caggregate\u201d approach, however, by its explicit terms, is solely for purposes of allocating a\ncorporate partner\u2019s distributive share of partnership interest expense. This special rule should not be treated as overriding the general rule applicable to the allocation\nof interest expense incurred directly by the partner for two main reasons. First, this special rule\nis not consistent with the fungibility approach, according to which the interest expense incurred\ndirectly by the corporate partner was for the purpose of funding the partner\u2019s investment in the\npartnership itself, not the assets held by the partnership. Second, if it was intended that a\ncorporate partner (such as TAXPAYER) be required to take into account the gross assets of a\npartnership for purposes of allocating its non-partnership interest expense, Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7\n1.861-9T(e)(2) would be superfluous, because no special rule would in fact then be needed for a\n\u201c10 percent or greater\u201d corporate partner. 5. Conclusion\nTAXPAYER believes its\u2019 tax return position to be correct based on the positions outlined above. 8",
