The Federal Trade Commission Study,\n\u201cAuthorized Generics; An Interim Report, 2009 WL 1847678 (F.T.C.), June 2009 found that \u201c[b]etween\nFY2004-FY2008, 76 final patent settlement agreements were with first-filer generics. About one-quarter\n(20 out of 76) of those patent settlements involved (1) an explicit agreement by the brand not to launch an\nAG to compete against the first filer, combined with (2) an agreement by the first-filer generic to defer its\nentry past the settlement date by, on average, 34.7 months. With regard to these twenty settlements,\nbranded sales of the affected products ranged from $12.6 million to $5.3 billion, with an average market\nsize of $917 million and a median market size of $514 million. Five of the settlements covered products\nwith annual sales of $1 billion, $1.1 billion, $2.1 billion, $2.5 billion, and $5.3 billion.\u201d See Asim Varma,\nSon B. Nguyen and Justin P. Hedge, The FTC Reports on Follow-On Biologics and Authorized Generics:\nApplying Lessons from Hatch-Waxman to Promote Competition, Antitrust 41, 42 (Fall, 2009) (addressing\ntwo reports issued by FTC).

Commissioner). 65 64 Food & Drug L.J. at 383-385. 66 Id. at 384 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). POSTU-139175-10 59 In light of the average selling price of the first generic drug in the\nmarket, some have estimated that a first filer awarded 180-day\nexclusivity could, in fact, \u201cexpect a 1,000 percent return on\ninvestment.\u201d In addition, first filers, by launching their generic drugs\nin the absence of other generic competitors, may have the\nadvantage of being able to enter into long-term supply contracts\nwith pharmacies retailing their products. The 180-day exclusivity is transferable in certain circumstances. See Mary W. Bourke\nand Edward Danberg, Current Trends in Hatch-Waxman Patent Litigation: A System\nStill in Flux, Practicing Law Institute 878 PLI/Pat 939, \u00a7 I.C.5 (2006) (\u201cexclusivity may be\ntransferred separately from the ANDA [quoting Mylan Pharm. Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F.\nSupp.2d 30, 47-48 (D.D.C. 2000)] that \u2018[e]xclusivity periods are a transferable\ncommodity which can be waived in favor of another generic manufacturer for a\nsubstantial price.\u2019\u201d)(emphasis added). 67 However, the 180-day exclusivity can be\nforfeited in certain circumstances. The court decision trigger for forfeiture states that 180-day exclusivity is\nforfeited if the applicant fails to market 75 days after, as to each patent at\nissue, \u201ca court enters a final decision from which no appeal (other than a\npetition to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari) has been or can be\ntaken that the patent is invalid or not infringed\u201d-- unless 75 days have not\nelapsed since the ANDA approval was effective and 30 months have not\nelapsed since the ANDA was submitted.",

How Long Should\nRecords Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items\nappearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and\n1099) until the statute of limitations runs\nout for that return. Usually, this is 3\nyears from the date the return was due or\nfiled or 2 years from the date the tax was\npaid, whichever is later. You should\nkeep some records longer. For example,\nkeep property records (including those\non your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or\nreplacement property. For more details,\nsee chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return\nFile Form 1040-X to change a return\nyou already filed. Generally, Form\n1040-X must be filed within 3 years af- ter the date the original return was filed\nor within 2 years after the date the tax\nwas paid, whichever is later. But you\nmay have more time to file Form\n1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically\nor mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. Use the Where's My Amended Return\napplication on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return. It can take\nup to 3 weeks from the date you mailed\nit to show up in our system. Need a Copy of Your\nTax Return Information? Tax return transcripts are free and are\ngenerally used to validate income and\ntax filing status for mortgage applications, student and small business loan\napplications, and during tax return preparation.

There is a fee for\neach return requested. See Form 4506\nfor the current fee. If your main home,\nprincipal place of business, or tax records are located in a federally declared\ndisaster area, this fee will be waived. Death of a Taxpayer If a taxpayer died before filing a return\nfor 2022, the taxpayer's spouse or personal representative may have to file and\nsign a return for that taxpayer. A personal representative can be an executor, administrator, or anyone who is in charge\nof the deceased taxpayer's property. If\nthe deceased taxpayer didn't have to file\na return but had tax withheld, a return\nmust be filed to get a refund. The person\nwho files the return must enter \u201cDeceased,\u201d the deceased taxpayer's name,\nand the date of death across the top of\nthe return. If this information isn't provided, it may delay the processing of the\nreturn. If your spouse died in 2022 and you\ndidn't remarry in 2022, or if your spouse\ndied in 2023 before filing a return for\n2022, you can file a joint return.

Section 453(a) provides\nthat, except as otherwise stated, income from an installment sales shall be taken into\naccount under the installment method. Section 453(b)(1) defines an installment sale as\na disposition of property where at least one payment is to be received after the close of\nthe taxable year in which the disposition occurs. Section 453(c) defines the installment\nmethod as a method of accounting under which the income is recognized for any\ntaxable year from a disposition of property being that proportion of the payments\nreceived in that year which the gross profit (realized or to be realized when the payment\nis completed) bears to the total contract price. Section 453(j)(2) provides that the\nSecretary of the Treasury shall prescribe regulations providing for ratable basis\nrecovery in transactions where the gross profit or the total contract price (or both)\ncannot readily be ascertained. Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a715A.453-1(c)(1) defines the term \u201ccontingent payment sale\u201d\nas a sale or other disposition of property in which the aggregate selling price cannot be\ndetermined by the close of the taxable year in which the sale or other disposition\noccurs.

The term \u201ccontingent payment sale\u201d does not include transactions with respect to\nwhich the installment obligation represents, under applicable principles of tax law, a\nretained interest in the property which is the subject of the transaction, an interest in a\njoint venture or a partnership, an equity interest in a corporation or similar transactions,\nregardless of the existence of a stated maximum selling price or fixed payment terms. Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a715A.453-1(c)(1). The regulations promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 453\ndistinguish a sale from the acquisition of an equity interest, with an equity interest not a\ndebt instrument.

    "text": "I am\npursuing several avenues that may generate revenue;\nhowever, there is no guarantee of success. DISCUSSION\nSection 165(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that\nthere shall be allowed as a deduction any loss sustained during\nthe taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or\notherwise. I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c) provides that in the case of an individual,\nthe deduction under subsection (a) is limited to losses incurred\nin a trade or business; losses incurred in any transaction\nentered into for profit, though not connected with a trade or\nbusiness; and losses of property not connected with a trade or\nbusiness if such losses arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, or\nother casualty, or from theft. Section 1.165-1(c) of the Income Tax Regulations provides\nthat the amount of the loss allowable as a deduction shall not\nexceed the adjusted basis for determining the loss from the sale\nor other disposition of the property involved, as prescribed by\n\u00a7 1.1011-1. Accordingly, to the extent an investor has claimed a\ndepreciation deduction or an ADA credit with regard to the\ninvestment in taxable years that are closed and not audited, the\nloss deduction will be reduced. - 5 The question may arise as to which of two sections allows\nthe loss deduction: I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c)(2), which allows individuals\nto deduct losses incurred in transactions entered into for\nprofit, or I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c)(3), which allows individuals to deduct\nlosses from theft. The distinction matters because I.R.C. \u00a7\n165(h) limits the deductibility of I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c)(3) theft\nlosses but does not limit I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c)(2) losses. From what we have heard about the investor pool, we expect\nthat most investors invested in the payphones with an expectation\nof making a profit4. Also, although the promoters may have\nengaged in activities that violate federal and state securities\nlaws, the record does not indicate that these actions resulted in\ntheft losses. Accordingly, the investors\u2019 losses are allowable\nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c)(2) and are not limited by I.R.C. \u00a7 165(h). Investors were promised a minimum 14 percent return on their\ninvestments and had a motive other than tax avoidance to invest. Nevertheless, auditors who encounter investors who clearly made\nthe investment solely for the tax benefits and who did not rely\non false statements in deciding to invest may determine that no\nloss is allowable. We stress that based on our knowledge of the\ntypical investor, disallowance of a loss will be the exception\nrather than the rule. Having determined that investors will generally be entitled\nto a loss deduction, we turn to the question of the tax year in\nwhich the loss will be allowed. Section 1.165-1(d)(1) provides that a loss is allowed for\nthe taxable year in which the loss is sustained, as evidenced by\nclosed and completed transactions and as fixed by identifiable\nevents occurring in such taxable year. We conclude, subject to the exceptions mentioned, that\ninvestors in the\npayphone scheme incurred a\ndeductible loss in 2003 5.

Add the\npenalty to any tax due and enter the total\non line 37. However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37.

A key fact is that the attorney fees at issue were incurred to obtain the\nright to market and sell new generic drugs in the United States. An overview of the\nstatutes, regulations, and case law that governs obtaining the right to market and sell\nnew generic drugs in the United States is set forth in Addendum A, attached hereto and\nincorporated herein. In the second step, addressed in Section II, below, whether the\nfees are within \u00a7 263 must be analyzed, specifically considering the 2004 capitalization\nof intangibles regulations. 20\nSection I. Origin of the Claim The characterization of the attorney fees at issue as deductible expenses within I.R.C.\n\u00a7 162 or as capital expenditures within I.R.C. \u00a7 263 must first be analyzed using the\norigin of the claim test.

See Deputy v. DuPont, 308 U.S.\n488, 494 (1940) (\u201cIt is the origin of the liability out of which the expense accrues which\nis material.\u201d) In Woodward v.

This court there held that the expense of\npreviously undertaken to develop the generic drugs and/or to establish their bioequivalence with the\nbranded drugs, so none of the fees are within Treas.
