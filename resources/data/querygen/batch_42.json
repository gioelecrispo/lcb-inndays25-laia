But you may be able to report a\nlower taxable amount by using the General Rule or the Simplified Method or if\nthe exclusion for retired public safety officers, discussed next, applies. Insurance Premiums for Retired\nPublic Safety Officers If you are an eligible retired public safety officer (law enforcement officer, firefighter, chaplain, or member of a rescue\nsquad or ambulance crew), you can elect\nto exclude from income distributions\nmade from your eligible retirement plan\nthat are used to pay the premiums for\ncoverage by an accident or health plan\nor a long-term care insurance contract. You can do this only if you retired because of disability or because you\nreached normal retirement age. The premiums can be for coverage for you, your\nspouse, or dependents. The distribution\nmust be from a plan maintained by the\nemployer from which you retired as a\npublic safety officer. Also, the distribution must be made directly from the plan\nto the provider of the accident or health\nplan or long-term care insurance contract. You can exclude from income the\nsmaller of the amount of the premiums\nor $3,000. You can make this election only for amounts that would otherwise\nbe included in your income.",

CC:LM:F:MAN:1:POSTF-112619-02 page 11 The courts have also found that a parent may deduct the\nexpenses of a subsidiary if the expenses were incurred by the\nparent with the underlying motivating purpose of protecting and\npromoting its own business.

Lohrke, 48 T.C. at 688; Snow,\n31 T.C. at 591. Second, the taxpayer must also show that the\nexpense is an ordinary and necessary expenditure in furtherance\nof its trade or business and not in furtherance of the trade or\nbusiness of the other taxpayer. Lohrke, 48 T.C. at 688.

Also\nsubtract from line 24 any:\n\u2022 Tax on an excess parachute payment,\n\u2022 Excise tax on insider stock compensation of an expatriated corporation,\n\u2022 Uncollected social security and\nMedicare or RRTA tax on tips or\ngroup-term life insurance, and\n\u2022 Look-back interest due under section 167(g) or 460(b). When figuring the amount on line 24,\ninclude household employment taxes\nonly if line 25d is more than zero or you\nwould have owed the estimated tax penalty for 2021 even if you didn't include\nthose taxes. If the Exception just described\ndoesn't apply, see the Instructions for\nForm 2210 for other situations in which\nyou may be able to lower your penalty\nby filing Form 2210. Figuring the Penalty If you choose to figure the penalty yourself, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farmers and fishermen). Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the\npenalty to any tax due and enter the total\non line 37. However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37. Don\u2019t file Form 2210 with your return unless Form 2210 indicates that you\nmust do so. Instead, keep it for your records. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. -60- Because Form 2210 is compli- TIP cated, you can leave line 38\nblank and the IRS will figure\nthe penalty and send you a bill. We\nwon't charge you interest on the penalty\nif you pay by the date specified on the\nbill. If your income varied during the\nyear, the annualized income installment\nmethod may reduce the amount of your\npenalty. But you must file Form 2210\nbecause the IRS can't figure your penalty under this method. Third Party Designee",
