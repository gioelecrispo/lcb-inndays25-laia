    "text": "I.R.C. \u00a7 943(b)(1)(A)\ndefines the term \"transaction\" as any sale, exchange, or other\ndisposition, any lease or rental, and any furnishing of related\nor subsidiary services. A parallel definition is included in the\nI.R.C. \u00a7 942 definition of FTGR as gross receipts from the sale,\nexchange, or other disposition, lease or rental and related or\nsubsidiary services of qualifying foreign trade property. I.R.C. \u00a7 942(a)(1). In other words, the ETI exclusion provisions apply to\ntransactions entered into on or after October 1, 2000. For\npurposes of this rule, \u201ctransaction\u201d and \u201ccontract\u201d are not\nsynonymous. See, e.g., ETI Act \u00a7 5(c)(1)(B) (distinguishing\nbetween transactions and contracts). A contract may give rise to\nmore than one transaction. And such transactions may be entered\ninto, for ETI exclusion and FSC purposes, at different times. As\nan example, consider Contract1 described above. The contract was\nsigned on Date1, and called for production and delivery of\nProductA. Pursuant to that same contract, the purchaser\nexercised an option, in Date2, for production and delivery of\nProductB. In this fact pattern, a contract made before the\neffective date of the ETI Act gave rise to two transactions, the\noriginal sale of ProductA and the second sale of ProductB. As we\nunderstand the facts of the case, the original sale was entered\ninto on the same date that the contract was made, Date1, and the\nsecond sale was entered into in Date2 when the option was\nexercised. The FSC 14 \u00a7 5(c) of the ETI Act provides for a transition period for existing FSCs. Initially, Taxpayer focused on the language of the transition provisions in\narguing it was entitled to report income under the ETI r\u00e9gime. However,\nTaxpayer has now recast it\u2019s argument to apply to all income generated\npursuant to pre-existing long-term contracts under the general effective date\nof the ETI Act. CC:LM:HMT:--------:POSTF-103313-03 page 16 provisions apply to the pre-ETI Act original transaction, and the\nETI exclusion provisions apply to the post-ETI Act second\ntransaction. In contrast, Taxpayer asserts it is entitled to report\nincome from military equipment sales after September 30, 2000\nunder the ETI regime rather than the FSC regime which,\nessentially, doubles it\u2019s tax benefit. Taxpayer insists it:\nmay apply the new ETI r\u00e9gime to taxable income\nreportable after September 30, -, regardless of whether\nthe income is attributable to a contract in effect\nprior to the enactment of ETI, and regardless of\nwhether income from previous years relating to the same\ncontract was reported under the FSC rules. (-------\u201c------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u201d (hereinafter \u201cTaxpayer\u2019s Position\nPaper\u201d), p. 1.) The crux of Taxpayer\u2019s assertion that it is entitled to the\nbenefits of the ETI Act rests on the definition of \u201ctransaction\u201d\nand, more specifically, \u201csale transaction.\u201d The determination of\nwhen a sale transaction occurs is factual. Persuasive arguments\ncan be made, depending on the specific facts, that Taxpayer\u2019s\nsale transactions for military equipment: (1) preceded the actual\nsigning of the contract when the buyer (the U.S. Government,\nforeign government or foreign entity) accepted the seller\u2019s\n(Taxpayer) offer and agreement on the terms of the sale was\nreached15; (2) occurred when the contract16 memorializing the\n15",

    "text": "Taxpayer concedes that LLC did not qualify\nas an eligible small ethanol producer during the period Date 3 through Date 7 and that\nTaxpayer and LLC were under common control within the meaning of \u00a7 40(g)(2) during\nthe period Date 3 through Date 7. However, Taxpayer argues that the aggregation rule\nin \u00a7 40(g)(2) does not require combining the productive capacity of a person that is not\nan eligible small ethanol producer (such as LLC) with the productive capacity of a\nperson that is an eligible small ethanol producer (such as Taxpayer). POSTU-121455-09 7 Contrary to Taxpayer\u2019s position, the application of 60 million gallon productive capacity\nlimitation under \u00a7 40(g)(1) and the aggregation rule in \u00a7 40(g)(2) is not limited only to\nentities that are eligible small ethanol producers when considered in isolation from other\nrelated entities, nor does the application of the rules exclude consideration of any\nentities that are not eligible small ethanol producers when considered in isolation. The\naggregation rule under \u00a7 40(g)(2) is applied to determine whether \u201call persons under\ncommon control\u201d satisfy the productive capacity limitation when considered in the\naggregate. The term \u201cpersons\u201d refers to all entities under common control regardless of\nwhether an entity satisfies the productive capacity limitation when considered in\nisolation. For example, if two entities under common control each satisfied the\nproductive capacity limitation individually during the taxable year but collectively\nexceeded the limitation at some point during the taxable year, then neither entity would\nbe an \u201celigible small ethanol producer\u201d at any time during the taxable year under the\naggregation rule. Similarly, if two entities under common control included one entity that\nsatisfied the productive capacity limitation while the other entity exceeded the limitation\nat some point during the taxable year, then neither entity would be an \u201celigible small\nethanol producer\u201d at any time during the taxable year under the aggregation rule. Taxpayer argues that its position is supported by Example 2 of Proposed Treasury\nRegulations \u00a7 1.40-2(d), because the aggregation rule under \u00a7 40(g)(2) was not applied\nin the example to combine the contract manufacturer\u2019s productive capacity with the\nproducer\u2019s productive capacity. Taxpayer argues that in this case LLC could be\nconsidered a contract manufacturer for Taxpayer and therefore LLC\u2019s productive\ncapacity should not be combined with Taxpayer\u2019s. Contrary to Taxpayer\u2019s interpretation\nof the proposed regulation, the \u00a7 40(g)(2) aggregation rule was not applied in the\nexample because the contract manufacturer and other party were unrelated. Since the\nparties in the example were unrelated, the aggregation rule in \u00a7 40(g)(2) was\ninapplicable. Regardless of whether LLC may have been a contract manufacturer for\nTaxpayer, the rule in \u00a7 40(g)(5) and the contract manufacturer rule in the proposed\nregulations does not apply in this case because Taxpayer and LLC were under common\ncontrol and therefore were treated as one person under the aggregation rule in\n\u00a7 40(g)(2). Taxpayer also argues that LLC\u2019s productive capacity would have been relevant for\npurposes of applying the productive capacity limitation to Taxpayer only if LLC had been\nan eligible small ethanol producer and had made an allocation of the small ethanol\nproducer credit to Taxpayer.",

LAW AND ANALYSIS\nRelationship Between Section 83 and Section 162\nSection 83 determines when a transfer of property in the\nconnection with the performances of services is taxable to a\nservice provider. Property for purposes of section 83 includes\nall real and personal property other than money or an unfunded\nand unsecured promise to pay money or property in the future. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.83-3(e). The most common types of property\ncovered by section 83 are stock and non-statutory stock options. Section 83(h) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.83-6(a)(1) provide that in\nthe case of a transfer of property under section 83, the person\nfor whom services were performed shall be allowed a deduction\nunder section 162 equal to the amount included in the gross\nincome of the person who performed the services, but only to the\nextent that such amount meets the requirements of section 162. See also Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.83-6(a)(2). Furthermore, Treas. Reg. \u00a7\n1.83-6(d) provides that if a shareholder of a corporation\ntransfers property to an employee of such corporation in\nconsideration of services performed for the corporation, the\ntransaction shall be considered to be a contribution of such\nproperty to the capital of the corporation, and immediately\nthereafter a transfer by the corporation of the property to the\nservice provider. CC:LM:F:MAN:1:POSTF-112619-02 page 4 Even though, as discussed in detail below, Young & Rubicam,\nInc. v. United States, 410 F.2d 1233 (Ct. Cl. 1969) and several\nother cases have held that under unique and compelling\ncircumstances, a section 162 deduction may be allowable by a\nparent if it pays the subsidiary\u2019s business expense for its own\ndirect and proximate benefit, there is not a \"direct and\nproximate benefit\" exception from the application of the specific\nrules of section 83. Thus, section 83 overrides section 162 in\nthe situation where parent grants stock options to the employees\nof its subsidiary. Therefore,\ntransfer of its\nshares to the employees of its subsidiaries should be treated as\nif\nhad made nondeductible contributions of\nsuch shares to its subsidiaries\u2019 capital upon the exercising of\nthe non-statutory options. To the extent allowed under the rules\nof section 83(h) and the regulations thereunder, the subsidiaries\nare entitled to a section 162 deduction associated with the\noptions. Although, section 83 overrides the \u201cdirect and\nproximate benefit\u201d exception to a section 162 deduction in\nsituation, we will analyze the facts of this case\nunder that exception. Section 162\nSection 162(a) allows a deduction for ordinary and necessary\nbusiness expenses, including a reasonable allowance for salaries\nor other compensation for personal services actually rendered.

    "text": "That is when A becomes entitled to the funds, and when any prepaid\nfunds held by A are no longer held in trust or as deposits and therefore are income to A,\nas discussed above. Treas. Reg. \u00a71.451-1(a). Issue 3: It is reasonable for the Service to determine that, in the absence of\nevidence to establish otherwise, gift checks provided by A to D stores for sale to\ncustomers have been sold the year the that A receives funds from D stores. It is reasonable to assume that D stores are unlikely to be advancing or\ndepositing money to be held-in-trust in exchange for gift checks that exceed the amount\nof gift checks that the D stores may sell. D stores do not want to keep excessive gift\nchecks on hand because they may be stolen, damaged, or lost. Just-in-Time-Inventory\nor a close approximation thereto, makes business sense because the gift checks are\nnot interest-bearing instruments. It is an accepted business principle that an entity\nwants to manage its cash and cash equivalents in a profitable manner by investing all\nnon-essential cash and cash equivalents. It is also reasonable to conclude that a D store will determine its inventory not\nless often than once a year, for purposes of determining its annual income and, in all\nlikelihood more frequently (to aid the taking of annual inventory through interim\ninventories or for financial statement preparation, interim or annual). In addition, as the\ntaxpayer is an association of the member franchisor and the franchisees and as the\ntaxpayer makes the gift check program available to participating members, it is\nreasonable to conclude that the taxpayer should be able to require its gift check\nparticipating members to provide information on the number of unsold gift checks on\nhand. An important factor to be considered is how often any one D store orders checks. It is reasonable to conclude that, when a store places a new order for gift checks, it is\nbecause it has sold all or almost all of its previously purchased gift checks to customers. The ordering party may always provide documentary evidence to the contrary. Therefore, it is reasonable for the Service to require A to establish by persuasive\ndocumentary evidence, including a reasonable estimate, the amount of gift check bank\naccount proceeds that represent unsold gift checks. In the absence of such evidence,\nwe conclude that it would be reasonable for the Service to determine that funds\nadvanced by D stores that remain in taxpayer\u2019s gift check bank accounts after a\nreasonable amount of time (e.g., for ----- days or more) represent gift check sales\nproceeds from sales by D stores to customers. There is no magical number; the figure ------ days is just one possible reasonable figure. What this reasonable amount of time is\nwould depend on the specific facts and circumstances. Each examiner or reviewer may\nconsider what a particular store\u2019s gift check inventory policy is and how often a store\norders, or reorders, gift checks.

More specific comments relating to the draft Form 886-A will be set\nforth in a separate correspondence. Issue Has the taxpayer engaged in a valid purchase of replacement property, as described in\n\u00a7 1033(a)(2)(A), for an involuntarily converted timber cutting contract with the U.S.\nForest Service. Conclusion\nTimber cutting contracts acquired by the taxpayer within the applicable replacement\nperiod will constitute \u00a7 1033 replacement property within the meaning of \u00a7\n1033(a)(2)(A). However, amounts expended as advance royalties, for example, which\nare normally payable to a lessor as timber is cut, are not expenditures for replacement\nproperty. Further, any purchase after the close of the applicable replacement period\ncannot be taken into account in determining the amount of gain deferred under \u00a7\n1033(a)(2)(A). Factual Summary A timber cutting contract between Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the taxpayer, and\nthe U.S. Forest Service was entered into on Date M. The timber was located in\nLocation X.\nIn Year 1, the Forest Service unilaterally changed certain pricing and volume provisions\nof the contract pursuant to the Act. The changes were effective on Date N. The\ntaxpayer sued and ultimately recovered, through a settlement with the U.S. government\non Date P, compensation of $A. In PLR 199911048, issued to the taxpayer, the IRS\nconcluded that enactment and implementation of the Act resulted in the involuntary\nconversion of the contract. The taxpayer originally reported $B as eligible for deferral on its Year 2 federal income\ntax return. The taxpayer has agreed, however, that of this $B amount, $C is no longer\neligible for deferral. Thus, the amount currently eligible for deferral is $D.\nIn Year 4, the taxpayer acquired 72 timber cutting contracts which it contends qualify as\nreplacement property under \u00a7 1033.1 The taxpayer estimates that it will owe an\nadditional amount of $E as timber is cut over the lives of the contracts. Accordingly, the\ntaxpayer argues that the $D received by the taxpayer due to the involuntary conversion\nhas been, or will be used to purchase other property similar or related in service or use\nto the converted property. Discussion\nSection 1033(a)(2)(A) provides, in part, that if a taxpayer, during the period specified for\nreplacing the involuntary converted property, \u201cpurchases other property similar or\n1 Section 1033(a)(2)(B)(titled \u201cPeriod Within Which Property Must be Replaced\u201d) generally provides a 2year replacement period. In this case, the 2-year period expired at the end of Year 3. The applicable 2year replacement period may be extended if special permission is obtained from the IRS. See\n\u00a71033(a)(2)(B). We understand an extension was secured in this case allowing for purchase of the\nreplacement property in Year 4. 2",
