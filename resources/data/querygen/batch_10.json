    "text": "\u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a qualiTIP fying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the\nEIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying\nchild. For more information, see Pub. 596. Example. Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the\nfive tax benefits listed here based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s AGI is higher than yours and you don\u2019t claim J as a qualifying child, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 596. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. Social security number (SSN). For the EIC, a valid SSN is a\nnumber issued by the Social Security Administration unless\n\u201cNot Valid for Employment\u201d is printed on the social security\ncard and the number was issued solely to allow the recipient of\nthe SSN to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit. However, if \u201cValid for Work Only With DHS Authorization\u201d is printed on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC purposes only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid. To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number\n(SSN) near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't\nhave an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You\nCan't File on Time? If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of\nyour 2022 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC\non your original or an amended 2022 return. If a child didn't\nhave an SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (including extensions), you can't count that child as a qualifying\nchild in figuring the amount of the EIC on your original or an\namended 2022 return. Student. A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar\nmonths of 2022 was enrolled as a full-time student at a school\nor took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school or\na state, county, or local government agency. A school includes a\ntechnical, trade, or mechanical school. It doesn't include an\non-the-job training course, correspondence school, or school offering courses only through the Internet.

Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nCases If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case, income taxable to the bankruptcy estate and reported on the estate's\nincome tax return includes:\n\u2022 Earnings from services you performed after the beginning of the case\n(both wages and self-employment income); and\n\u2022 Income from property described in\nsection 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code\nthat you either owned when the case began or that you acquired after the case\nbegan and before the case was closed,\ndismissed, or converted to a case under a\ndifferent chapter. Because this income is taxable to the\nestate, don\u2019t include this income on your\n-23- own individual income tax return. The\nonly exception is for purposes of figuring your self-employment tax. For that\npurpose, you must take into account all\nyour self-employment income for the\nyear from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is appointed) must allocate between you and\nthe bankruptcy estate the wages, salary,\nor other compensation and withheld income tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for income and withheld income tax reported\nto you on Forms 1099. You must also\ninclude a statement that indicates you\nfiled a chapter 11 case and that explains\nhow income and withheld income tax reported to you on Forms W-2 and 1099\nare allocated between you and the estate. For more details, including acceptable\nallocation methods, see Notice 2006-83,\n2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at\nIRS.gov/irb/\n2006-40_IRB#NOT-2006-83. Community Property States\nCommunity property states include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington,\nand Wisconsin. If you and your spouse\nlived in a community property state, you\nmust usually follow state law to determine what is community income and\nwhat is separate income. For details, see\nForm 8958 and Pub. 555. Nevada, Washington, and California\ndomestic partners. A registered domestic partner in Nevada, Washington,\nor California must generally report half\nthe combined community income of the\nindividual and their domestic partner. See Form 8958 and Pub. 555. Rounding Off to Whole\nDollars You can round off cents to whole dollars\non your return and schedules. If you do\nround to whole dollars, you must round\nall amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from\n50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more\namounts to figure the amount to enter on\na line, include cents when adding the\namounts and round off only the total. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. If you are entering amounts that include cents, make sure to include the\ndecimal point. There is no cents column\non the form. The lines on Forms 1040 and\n1040-SR are the same.

CONCLUSIONS\n1(a). It is generally not appropriate to impose a penalty against both the\nbusiness and a responsible individual. The Service should assess the penalty against\nthe business entity unless the Service has evidence that the party who filed the return\nwas not authorized to do so. 1 We note that Form 942, Employer's Quarterly Tax Return for Household Employees, was replaced by\nSchedule H (Form 1040), Household Employment Taxes, in 1995 and is therefore not included in our\nanalysis. Additionally, because certain small businesses are eligible to file Form 944, Employer\u2019s\nANNUAL Federal Tax Return, rather than Form 941, Employer\u2019s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, it is\nrelevant to the discussion contained in this memorandum, and so references to it have been added in our\nanalysis. 2 You have told us that the Transaction Code 766 applies to Advanced Earned Income Credit, Form 2439\ncredit, backup withholding, Federal income tax withheld at source, and fuel tax credits. POSTN-119570-10/SCAF-106587-10 page 3 (b). Because it is generally not appropriate to impose a section 6702 penalty\nagainst both the business and a responsible individual, normally only one assessment\nwould be made. In the rare event that more than one person is responsible for the filing\nof a frivolous return or submission, separate assessments against these persons may\nbe appropriate. We caution, however, that the liability for the section 6702 penalties is\nnot a joint and several liability.\n(c). While it is possible that more than one person is responsible for the filing of\na frivolous business return, we think it will occur rarely and recommend that you consult\nwith SBSE counsel when you think the frivolous return penalty might apply.\n(d). Our answer to question 1(c) would not vary if the taxpayer had multiple\nofficers or members.\n(e). Our answer to question 1(c) would not vary if the business return is signed\nor if no one signed the return.\n(f). The Service would need to apply different procedures when dealing with a\nsole proprietorship. We have addressed this in the memorandum below.\n(g). The Service would not apply different rules when dealing with an S\ncorporation as compared with a C corporation. 2. Withholding taxes reported on a Business Master File (BMF) return may be\nassessed without following deficiency procedures, however, in certain cases where an\nexamination involves worker classification issues, procedures under section 7436 apply. 3. When an employer claims the advanced earned income credit claimed on\nForms 941, 943 and 944, statutory notice of deficiency procedures and math error\nprocedures will not apply. If the Service could identify the credit as false before\napplying it to the taxpayer account and using it either to offset other liabilities or before\nissuing a refund, the Service could just reverse the credit. Otherwise, the procedures\nfor determining and assessing a liability as part of an employment tax audit would apply.",

    "text": "Taxpayers must sign returns as specified in the forms or\nregulations specified by the Secretary of the Treasury. I.R.C. \u00a7 6061. Corporations\nsign returns through an officer authorized to act for the corporation. I.R.C. \u00a7 6062. Partnerships sign returns through one of the partners. I.R.C. \u00a7 6063. The presence of\nthe signature on the corporate or partnership return is treated as prima facie evidence\nthat the person had authority to act on behalf of the entity. Accordingly, when the\nService receives a frivolous business return from an entity, we conclude that the Service\nshould treat that return as filed by the entity taxpayer unless the taxpayer comes\nforward with strong evidence to establish that an unauthorized party signed and filed the\nreturn. Without such evidence, the Service should assert the frivolous return penalty\nagainst the entity as the person filing the return. This determination would remain\nlargely the same no matter what type of entity the Service was reviewing and no matter\nwhat type or number of members it had. The fact that the entity acts through its\nmembers would generally not provide a valid legal basis for asserting multiple penalties\nagainst the members of the entity who participated in the preparation or filing of the\nreturn. 3\n3 The Service may consider assessing the penalty under section 6701 or 6694 against those who\nparticipated in the preparation or filing of the return or the return preparer of a frivolous return. Section\n6701 imposes a penalty upon any person who: POSTN-119570-10/SCAF-106587-10 page 7 Issue 1(b). If the answer to question 1(a) is yes, would the two assessments be\nseparate liabilities of $5,000 each or would the two assessments be joint and\nseveral so that the Service would collect a single penalty of $5,000? Because it is generally not appropriate to impose a section 6702 penalty against\nboth the business and a responsible individual, normally only one assessment would be\nmade. The section 6702 penalty is not a joint and several liability, cf. I.R.C.\n\u00a7 6013(d)(3). It is imposed, in the case of section 6702(a)(1), on a \u201cperson\u201d who, in\nfurtherance of a frivolous position or a prima facie intent to delay or impede\nadministration of the tax law, files a purported return that fails to contain information\nfrom which the correctness of the reported tax liability can be determined or that clearly\nindicates that the tax liability shown must be substantially incorrect. In the case of\nsection 6702(b)(1), it is imposed on \u201cany person\u201d who submits a specified frivolous\nsubmission. Issue 1(c). If the Service determined that more than one person was responsible\nfor the filing of the frivolous business return, could it make a separate\nassessment under section 6702 against each such person? As discussed above, because it is generally not appropriate to impose a section\n6702 penalty against both the business and a responsible individual, normally only one\nassessment would be made. In imposing the section 6702 penalty, the Service must\nmake some factual determinations such as: who signed the return, in what role did the\nperson signing the return act, and was the filing of the return a filing by the taxpayer or\n1.",

    "text": "For the purpose of computing its section 199\ndomestic production activities deduction, Coop\u2019s qualified production activities income\nand taxable income should, pursuant to section 199 (d)(3)(C) of the Code, be computed\nwithout regard to any deduction for b payments to members and participating patrons. In other words, all of Coop\u2019s b payments in cash to members and participating patrons\nfor 20--- could be classified as \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money\u201d and that they\nshould be added back in its section 199 computation. POSTF-143023-10 10 ADDITIONAL FACTS MATERIAL TO THE 20--- TAX YEAR In addition to the facts considered in the 2008 PLR (those set above), there are\nother facts that need to be considered for the 20--- year. First, Examination has not been presented and is unaware of any facts that\nwould contradict the conclusion that, at the end of 20--- the Coop and its members (or\nparticipating patrons) considered the b purchases to be completed contractual\npurchases (closed transactions) and not open per-unit retain transactions. Second, the documentary evidence that exists shows a closed transaction. Until\non or about October 20---, the date of a memorandum from the Coop to its patrons\ninforming them that they would be receiving amended Forms 1099PATR for the 20--year (Exhibit A), the taxpayer did not amend its Forms 1099-PATRs to treat \u201cpurchases\u201d\nas per-unit retains paid in money. There is no evidence that members (or participating\npatrons) have agreed to reopen their closed b sales and turn them into open per-unit\nretain transactions. The Coop and its members (or participating patrons) have not\nagreed to amended by-laws that would change the treatment of sum certain, fixed\nproceeds from closed (oral or written) b purchase contracts into \u201cper-unit retains.\u201d To\nthe extent that per-unit retains only represent an \u201cadvance\u201d of the patrons\u2019 equity in the\nb commodity, per-unit retains could conceivably be recovered by the Coop from the\nmembers or participating patrons, if they could not be resold by the Coop, at a profit;\nproceeds from fulfilled and completed b purchase contracts would not. The Coop and\nits members (or participating patrons) have neither amended nor entered into\nnegotiations to amend the 20--- b purchase contracts. There is no evidence that an\namendment was effected either orally or in writing. Similarly, there is no evidence of\nmutual assent or mutual intention to effect an amendment. Finally, the Coop and its\nmembers (or participating patrons) have not enacted or agreed to enact amended\ncooperative by-laws that would obliterate distinctions between open per unit retains and\nclosed b purchases; or, at least, shown an intention to treat them as one and the same. Third, the Coop\u2019s 8 \u00bd month payment period after the close of the Coop\u2019s 20----tax year for payment of per-unit retains has ended (I.R.C. \u00a71382(d)), and the period\nexpired without the taxpayer and its members or participating patrons taking any steps\nto agree to reclassify or to treat purchases as per-unit retains; or to report to the\nmembers and participating patrons that the b purchases were being reclassified to perunit retains.",
