Harris\nInternational Examiner (New Orleans)\n(Large & Mid-Size Business)\nAssociate Area Counsel (Houston, Group 1)\n(Large & Mid-Size Business) subject: Foreign Tax Credit This memorandum responds to your request for assistance dated March 22,\n2010. This advice may not be used or cited as precedent. This writing may contain privileged information. Any unauthorized disclosure of\nthis writing may undermine our ability to protect the privileged information. If disclosure\nis determined to be necessary, please contact this office for our views. ISSUES\n1.\nSection 905(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a taxpayer may\nclaim a foreign tax credit in the year in which the foreign tax accrued. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------, an accrual-basis taxpayer, contested its ----------and ------------------ withholding taxes. In -------, it paid the taxes and resolved the\ndispute. In which taxable years may ---------------claim the credits? 2.\nSection 6511(d)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the tenyear period of limitations to file a foreign-tax-credit refund claim begins on the due date\nof the return for the year in which the foreign tax was actually paid or accrued. On its\namended --------return, ---------------claimed a refund for foreign tax credits relating to its --------and ------- -----------withholding taxes. When did the period of limitations begin? POSTF-113176-10 2\nCONCLUSIONS 1.\nSubject to the limitations period prescribed in section 6511(d)(3)(A), --------------------- may claim the foreign tax credits in its --------and --------taxable years \u2014 and\nnot in its --------taxable year. For purposes of section 905(a), the -----------withholding taxes are considered to\nhave accrued in --------and --------when the foreign-source income was subject to the\ntaxes, even though under traditional accrual principles the accrual was not perfected\nuntil -------, when the contest was resolved. Because the purpose of the foreign tax\ncredit is to avoid the double taxation of foreign-source income, consistent with Revenue\nRuling 58-55, the accrual of the taxes in --------related back to --------and -------, the\nyears to which the taxes related and the years in which -----------------income was subject\nto -----------tax. 2.\nThe period of limitations began on the due dates (without extensions) of\nthe returns for the --------and --------taxable years because the -----------withholding taxes\naccrued in those years for purposes of the foreign tax credit and the relevant period of\nlimitations. In 1997, the amendment to section 6511(d)(3)(A) removed the language, \u201cfor the\nyear with respect to which the claim is made,\u201d and substituted the language \u201cfor the year\nin which such taxes were actually paid or accrued.\u201d The only purpose for the\namendment was to clarify that the limitations period is determined by reference to the\nyear to which the tax relates, and not the year in which foreign taxes, paid or accrued,\nthat exceed the section 904 limitation for such year are \u201cdeemed\u201d paid or accrued under\nthe carryover provisions of section 904(c) and claimed as a credit. In the amended\nlanguage, the word \u201cactually\u201d distinguishes the year paid or the relation-back year from\nthe year in which the taxes are \u201cdeemed\u201d paid or accrued under the carryover\nprovisions.",

    "text": "And for accrual-basis taxpayers, the year in which taxes accrue is the\nyear to which the taxes relate. Through the enactment of the 1997 amendment to\nsection 6511(d)(3)(A), Congress adopted the IRS\u2019s position in the ruling. Revenue Ruling 84-125 amplified Revenue Ruling 58-55, and applied the\nrelation-back doctrine to the accrual principles of the foreign tax credit to determine in\n51 Id. POSTF-113176-10 13 which taxable year the credit was allowed. 52 The accrual-basis taxpayer, who contested\na foreign tax assessment, may claim the credit in the taxable year to which the foreign\ntax related, even though the credit may not be claimed (except to the extent the tax was\nalready paid) until the tax was finally determined and the accrual was perfected. 53 The\nruling specifically held that the taxpayer may claim the credit when the tax was paid and\nfinally determined, but for purposes of the foreign tax credit, the tax accrued for the\ntaxable year to which the tax related. 54 And in interpreting the pre-amendment\nlanguage of section 6511(d)(3)(A), it held that the claim for refund of the foreign tax\ncredit must be made within ten years of the due date of the return for the year to which\nthe foreign tax related, that is, the year the taxes accrued. 55 In the instant case, for purposes of the foreign tax credit, the ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------withholding taxes\naccrued in --------and -------, the years to which the taxes related. Since the amendment\nwas effective for taxes accrued in the taxable years after August 5, 1997, the preamendment version of section 6511(d)(3)(A) applies to the --------taxes and the postamendment version applies to the --------taxes. But under both versions, the\ndetermination is the same because Congress adopted the IRS\u2019s position in Revenue\nRuling 84-125 as to the date on which the limitations period begins. And in any event,\nsince the instant case does not involve a carryover of excess tax credits, the \u201cyear to\nwhich the claim relates\u201d and the \u201cyear in which the taxes are actually paid or accrued\u201d\nare one and the same.

The preceding\nsentence does not apply to presentations marketing\nor promoting transactions. (2) The practitioner must\u2014\n(i) Base the written advice on reasonable factual\nand legal assumptions (including assumptions as to\nfuture events);\n(ii) Reasonably consider all relevant facts\nand circumstances that the practitioner knows or\nreasonably should know;\n(iii) Use reasonable efforts to identify and\nascertain the facts relevant to written advice on each\nFederal tax matter;\n(iv) Not rely upon representations, statements,\nfindings, or agreements (including projections,\nfinancial forecasts, or appraisals) of the taxpayer\nor any other person if reliance on them would be\nunreasonable;\nTreasury Department Circular No. 230 Table of Contents (v) Relate applicable law and authorities to\nfacts; and\n(vi) Not, in evaluating a Federal tax matter, take\ninto account the possibility that a tax return will not\nbe audited or that a matter will not be raised on audit. (3) Reliance on representations, statements,\nfindings, or agreements is unreasonable if the\npractitioner knows or reasonably should know that\none or more representations or assumptions on which\nany representation is based are incorrect, incomplete,\nor inconsistent. (b) Reliance on advice of others. A practitioner\nmay only rely on the advice of another person if the\nadvice was reasonable and the reliance is in good\nfaith considering all the facts and circumstances. Reliance is not reasonable when\u2014 (1) The practitioner knows or reasonably should\nknow that the opinion of the other person should not\nbe relied on;\n(2) The practitioner knows or reasonably should\nknow that the other person is not competent or lacks\nthe necessary qualifications to provide the advice; or\n(3) The practitioner knows or reasonably should\nknow that the other person has a conflict of interest in\nviolation of the rules described in this part. (c) Standard of review. (1) In evaluating whether a practitioner giving\nwritten advice concerning one or more Federal\ntax matters complied with the requirements of this\nsection, the Commissioner, or delegate, will apply a\nreasonable practitioner standard, considering all facts\nand circumstances, including, but not limited to, the\nscope of the engagement and the type and specificity\nof the advice sought by the client.

    "text": "The court held that, although ill-gotten gains were included\nin gross income under I.R.C. \u00a761, I.R.C. \u00a71341\u2019s \u201c\u2019unrestricted right\u2019 language must be\nread to exclude from its coverage all those who receive earnings knowing themselves to\nhave no legal right thereto.\u201d In Barrett v. Commissioner, 96 T.C. 713 (1991), petitioner husband repaid $54,400.00 in\n1984 to settle a claim alleging that he used insider information to buy and sell securities. The Tax Court found that the petitioners were entitled to I.R.C. \u00a7 1341 relief for the\nrepayment because, according to the Tax Court, \u201cwhile maintaining his innocence,\u201d\npetitioner husband disgorged these funds as part of an arms-length settlement of a civil\nlawsuit. These types of settlements \u201chave substantially the same effect as judgments\u201d POSTS-152317-07 4 and provide sufficient proof of a taxpayer\u2019s ultimate lack of unrestricted right to the\nincome and the applicability of I.R.C. \u00a71341. The Service disagreed with the Barrett decision (AOD-1992-08), noting that the Tax\nCourt\u2019s reasoning was incomplete because the court failed to determine if a \u201cnexus\u201d\nexisted between the claim of right and the repayment. The Service also noted that,\nalthough it did not recommend appeal, it would seek to distinguish the Barrett case on\nits facts in the future. In George C. and Elaine E. Parks v. United States of America, 945 F.Supp. 865 (W.D.\nPa. 1996), the plaintiffs repaid proceeds received from the sale of their home security\nbusiness in connection with the settlement of fraud-related litigation arising from the\nsale. In moving for summary judgment, the plaintiffs argued that there were no disputed\nmaterial facts and that Barrett controlled. The Parks Court disagreed, noting that \u201cthe\nTax Court [in Barrett] implicitly accepted the notion that it appeared that the taxpayer\nhad an unrestricted right to the funds.\u201d The court refused to do that in Parks because to do so \u201cwould conclusively eliminate the\ngovernment\u2019s opportunity to demonstrate that the income was derived from fraud, and\nthat a corresponding refund would reward the fraud, contrary to section 1341.\u201d The\ncourt then denied the plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion, noting that \u201ctaxpayers may\nbe required to undergo trial by operation of section 1341 to vindicate [their unrestricted\nright to income], even though they may have settled direct claims of liability for the same\nalleged wrongdoing.\u201d In Stephen S. Wang, Jr. v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1998-389, the Tax Court had an\nopportunity post-Barrett to revisit the applicability of I.R.C. \u00a71341 in the context of\nrepayment of funds received from wrongdoing or alleged wrongdoing. In this case, the\nService argued that petitioner was not entitled to I.R.C. \u00a7 1341 relief for disgorging\nprofits related to sale of insider information because: 1) he never included the insider\ntrading proceeds in his income; 2) he did not receive the insider trading income under a\nclaim of right (that he did not have an unrestricted right to the income when he received\nit); and, 3) illegally obtained income does not, per se, give rise to a claim of right. Petitioner argued Barrett controlled, as that case was factually similar, and that he was\ntherefore entitled to relief under I.R.C. \u00a71341.",

    "text": "In the case of interest expense, as is relevant\nhere, section 864(e)(2) specifically requires that all\nallocations and apportionments of interest expense be made on the\nbasis of assets, not gross income. Under the asset method, interest expense is apportioned\nbetween statutory and residual groupings of gross income (or\namong statutory groupings) in proportion to the average total\nvalues of the assets within each such grouping for the taxable\nyear. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(g)(1)(i). For this purpose,\ntaxpayers may elect to value their assets based on their tax book\nvalue or fair market value. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-8T(c)(2) and\nl.861-9T(g)(1)(ii). The application of the FMV method of\nvaluation, as was elected here by the TAXPAYER, requires\nrecognition of a number of regulatory requirements:\nFirst, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(1)(i) requires the taxpayer\nto determine the aggregate value of its assets, including stock\nin foreign subsidiaries or any other asset. In the case of a\npublicly traded corporation, aggregate asset value is equal to\nstock value increased by the liabilities of the taxpayer (owed to\nunrelated persons) and its share of liabilities of related CC:LM:HMT:CIN:1:POSTF-168001-03 Page 5 persons owed to unrelated persons. 2 In the case of non-publicly\ntraded corporations, aggregate asset value must be determined by\nreference to the capitalization of corporate earnings in\naccordance with the rules of Rev. Rul. 68-609. Second, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii) requires the\ntaxpayer to determine the value of all its tangible assets, and\nits pro rata share of such assets held by related persons. For\nthis purpose, the value of stock in any corporation that is not a\nrelated person must be determined under the rules of Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(1)(i), except that no liabilities shall be taken\ninto account. And third, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(4) generally provides\nthat the value of stock in a related person equals the sum of the\nintangible asset value apportioned under (h)(2) to such related\nperson, plus the taxpayer\u2019s share of tangible assets held by such\nrelated person, less the taxpayer\u2019s pro rata share of the related\nperson\u2019s liabilities. In applying those regulatory requirements to a partnership\ninterest, certain apportionment rules must be followed. Interest\nexpense incurred by a partnership must be apportioned under the\nregime established by Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(e). In that regard,\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(e) generally adopts an aggregate, or lookthrough, approach in apportioning a partner\u2019s distributive share\nof interest expense incurred by the partnership. Subsection\n(e)(1) provides the general rule that a partner\u2019s distributive\nshare of the interest expense of a partnership is considered\nrelated to all income producing activities and assets of the\npartner. Likewise, subsection (e)(2), in accordance with the\naggregate approach, requires that a corporate partner whose\ninterest in the partnership is 10 percent or more must apportion\nits distributive share of partnership interest expense by\nreference to the partner\u2019s assets, including the partner\u2019s pro\nrata share of the partnership assets under the rules of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(f). However, limited partners and corporate general partners\nwith a less-than-ten-percent partnership interest are excepted\nfrom aggregate treatment. In cases involving less-than-10percent limited or general partners, subsection (e)(4) treats the\npartnership as an entity for interest apportionment purposes. Moreover, subsection (e)(4)(i) provides that a limited partner or\n2 Treas.",
