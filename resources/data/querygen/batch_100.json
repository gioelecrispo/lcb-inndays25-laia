See Letter 950-C, Employment Tax 30-Day\nLetter-WC, and Letter 3523, Notice of Determination of Worker Classification. The same rules allowing immediate assessment apply to backup withholding.

Pursuant to section 3507, an employer shall make payments of advanced earned\nincome credit along with wages when an employee has an eligibility certificate in effect. An employer\u2019s payment of advanced earned income credit with the wage shall not be\ntreated as compensation. I.R.C. \u00a7 3507(d). Instead the employer treats the advanced\nearned income credit paid to employees as a credit which reduces the employer\u2019s\nobligation to pay employment taxes, which for purposes of this section means income\ntax withholding, employee FICA tax, and employer FICA tax that would otherwise be\ndue to the government. I.R.C. \u00a7 3507(d)(1)(B). If the employer elects to do so, it can\npay the full amount of the advanced earned income credit even though it exceeds the\namount of such employment taxes due in a period. In that event, the employer may\ntreat the advance earned income credit which exceeds the employment taxes due as an\nadvance payment of such employment taxes. I.R.C. \u00a7 3507(d)(3).

Requirements for an\nElectronic Return To file your return electronically, you\nmust sign the return electronically using\na personal identification number (PIN)\nand provide the information described\nbelow. If you are filing online using\nsoftware, you must use a Self-Select\nPIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a\nSelf-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. For 2022, if we issued you an identity\nprotection personal identification number (IP PIN) (as described in more detail\nbelow), all six digits of your IP PIN\nmust appear in the IP PIN spaces provi- ded next to the space for your occupation for your electronic signature to be\ncomplete. Failure to include an issued IP\nPIN on the electronic return will result\nin an invalid signature and a rejected return. If you are filing a joint return and\nboth taxpayers were issued an IP PIN,\nenter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN\nmethod allows you to create your own\nPIN. If you are married filing jointly,\nyou and your spouse will each need to\ncreate a PIN and enter these PINs as\nyour electronic signatures. A PIN is any combination of five digits you choose except five zeros. If you\nuse a PIN, there is nothing to sign and\nnothing to mail\u2014not even your Forms\nW-2. Your electronic return is considered a\nvalidly signed return only when it includes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your adjusted gross income (AGI) from your\noriginally filed 2021 federal income tax\nreturn, if applicable. If you're filing\njointly, your electronic return must also\ninclude your spouse's PIN, last name,\ndate of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and\nAGI, if applicable, in order to be considered validly signed. Don\u2019t use your AGI\nfrom an amended return (Form 1040-X)\nor a math error correction made by the\nIRS. AGI is the amount shown on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. If\nyou don\u2019t have your 2021 income tax return, call the IRS at 800-908-9946 to get\na free transcript of your return or visit\nIRS.gov/Transcript. (If you filed electronically last year, you, and your\nspouse if filing jointly, may use your\nprior year PIN to verify your identity instead of your prior year AGI. The prior\nyear PIN is the five-digit PIN you used\nto electronically sign your 2021 return.) You can't use the Self-Select\nPIN method if you are a\nCAUTION first-time filer under age 16 at\nthe end of 2022. ! Practitioner PIN. The Practitioner PIN\nmethod allows you to authorize your tax\npractitioner to enter or generate your\nPIN. Your electronic return is considered a validly signed return only when it\nincludes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, and IP PIN, if applicable. If you're -61- filing jointly, your electronic return must\nalso include your spouse's PIN, last\nname, date of birth, and IP PIN, if applicable in order to be considered validly\nsigned.

    "text": "The Taxpayer's Protest addresses the question more obliquely, arguing that\n\"The RBC [Risk-Based Capital] instruction makes it clear that the NAIC considers\nProgram X-type arrangements as ASC/Cost-plus contracts.\" Protest, page 10. We do not believe that it is necessary for purposes of this case to determine a\nprecise definition of \"cost-plus\" within the meaning of section 833(b), because the\nTaxpayer's Program X arrangements do not satisfy the minimal definitional requirement\n-- the \"cost\" is not a liability incurred by the Taxpayer. We believe the issue can be\ndecided by a simple analysis of the statute. However, due to the significance of this\nissue we will address the Taxpayer's NAIC arguments under a separate heading. The primary issue in this case raises three questions:\nMay multiple Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations include the same claim\nor liability in the computation of their special deductions under section 833(b)? Where multiple Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are involved in the\nadministration of a claim, which plan may include the claim in the computation of\nits special deduction under section 833(b)? May the Taxpayer include BCBS Program X arrangements in the computation of\nits special deduction under section 833(b)? POSTU-144536-09 8 A. May multiple Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations include the same claim\nor liability in the computation of their special deductions under section 833(b)? The background and legislative history of section 833 are fairly straightforward\nand consistent with the history and legal and economic status of BCBS organizations at\nthe time of enactment of section 833: The purpose of the special deduction is to allow\ngeographically restricted, nonprofit organizations to accumulate a working level of\nsurplus, measured by the annual volume of their claims. The legislative history and statutory purpose of section 833 are inconsistent with\nmultiple deductions by multiple BCBS plans with respect to the same provider claim. \"Surplus\" or \"reserves\" are only needed for one payment of a claim, not for each\ntransfer of funds between BCBS plans during the claim administration process. B. Where multiple Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are involved in the\nadministration of a claim, which plan may include the claim in the computation of\nits special deduction under section 833(b)? The legislative history and statutory purpose of section 833 are directed at a\nsingle entity, the entity subject to tax under section 833. It is claims of that entity that\nmay be includible in the special deduction. Where a statute allows a deduction for an item \"paid or incurred,\" the deduction\nis only allowable to the person or entity incurring the liability that is being paid. Where\nthe special deduction under section 833(b) is based upon \"claims incurred\" and\n\"liabilities incurred,\" it can only refer to claims and liabilities of the party claiming the\nspecial deduction. One ground stated in the Revenue Agent's Report for disallowance of the\nTaxpayer's claims is that allowance of the claims would \"result in a double deduction,\"\nbecause \"both the Control/Home Plan and Host Plan ([Taxpayer]) would be including\nthe same claim in its special deduction.\"",
