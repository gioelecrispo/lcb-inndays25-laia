    "text": "Further, the fact that the terms of the purchase can be interpreted to fit the\ndefinition of per-unit retains in the Code does not mean that a purchase and a per-unit\nretain are one and the same. There is no reason to allow this artificial treatment when to\nallow the reclassification acts to the detriment of the Service\u2019s third-party beneficiary\nright to rely on the form and substance of the closed b purchase transaction. Given\nclosed members\u2019 and participating patrons\u2019 years and no timely notice of the treatment\nof b purchases as per-unit retain, before the statute of limitations to make assessments\nagainst most of the parties to the b transaction is closed, the Service is clearly\nprejudiced by reclassification. This is because the Service is unable to plan and carry\nout examinations of closed patron and participating members\u2019 years, to prevent being\nwhip-sawed by incompatible section 199 treatment between the Coop and its members\nand patrons. It follows, that once either the Cooperative\u2019s or the member\u2019s (or\nparticipating patron\u2019s) taxable year is closed, it is too late to reclassify a sale/purchase\ntransaction, between the Cooperative and that member or participating patron, into a ---------------, for that year. This is true even if the parties are willing to agree to the\nreclassification. POSTF-143023-10 23 The doctrines of election and consistency and equitable principles support the Service\nin denying the reclassification. It is a given in this case that, the Coop and its members and participating patrons\nhave an uninterrupted course of treating these b purchases as cost of goods sold,\ncapitalizing them into the Coop\u2019s inventory. The Coop treated them as cost of goods\nsold and all the parties (Coop, members and participating patrons) intended to, and\nconsidered them to be completed sale proceeds, not per-unit retains paid in money. Assuming that the Coop could have chosen to treat the transactions as --------------, it did\nnot timely do so for the tax year 20---, as the time to timely file 20--- income tax returns\nor amended returns have now expired. The Coop should be held to its election to treat\nthe b purchases as capitalized inventory and, then, cost of goods sold; and the\nmembers and participating patrons should be protected in their reliance in this tax\ntreatment, when filing their own tax returns. Similarly, the Service should be protected in\nhaving relied on petitioner\u2019s Forms 1099-PATR, as originally filed for the year 20---. The\ndoctrines of election and consistency and equitable principles support holding the\ntaxpayer to its original tax treatment of the b purchases. In the Southern Pac. Transp. Co. v. Commissioner, 75 T.C. 497, 838-840 (1980)\ncase, the U.S. Tax Court discussed a number of related theories that support preventing\na taxpayer from changing its prior tax position when it unfairly operates against the\nService. Among these are estoppel, quasi-estoppel, \u201cduty of consistency\u201d, equitable\nestoppel, laches, election, and staleness of claim. The Court explained that the doctrine\nof \u201celection\u201d is sometimes invoked as an alternative to estoppel or quasi-estoppel. Finally, the Court explained that the doctrine of \u201celection\u201d binds a taxpayer to a choice\nmade by him between two proper alternative treatments and to act consistent with his\nchoice.",

Either of the following applies. a. The custodial parent signs Form 8332 or a substantially\nsimilar statement that they won't claim the child as a dependent\nfor 2022, and the noncustodial parent includes a copy of the\nform or statement with their return. If the divorce decree or separation agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009,\nthe noncustodial parent may be able to include certain pages\nfrom the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. See\nPost-1984 and pre-2009 decree or agreement and Post-2008\ndecree or agreement. b.

Eligible\nindividuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance\ncompany. If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the\npremium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach\nForm 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year. The Marketplace is required to send Form 1095-A by January 31, 2023, listing the advance payments and other\ninformation you need to complete Form 8962. 1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace. 2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments. 3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR. (Don\u2019t include Form 1095-A.)

Therefore, this ruling does not support taking the credit in ----------------- ---------taxable year. ---------------also relied on Campbell to support its assertion that the credit may be\nclaimed only on its --------return. But it misread the Campbell court\u2019s discussion of\nRevenue Ruling 58-55. It ignored the court\u2019s entire description of the ruling. Instead, it\nbifurcated one of the court\u2019s sentences and took each portion out of context. Following\nthe description of Revenue Ruling 58-55, the court stated: Thus, if the taxpayer contests his liability for a foreign tax imposed on\nincome in 1960, and this liability is finally adjudicated in the foreign country\nin 1965, \u2018the credit may not be claimed until 1965 . . . (but) the foreign tax\nimposed on 1960 income will be offset against the United States 1960 tax\njust as if it had accrued in 1960. \u201933\n---------------interpreted the initial part of this sentence, ending with \u201cthe credit may\nnot be claimed until 1965,\u201d to mean that \u201cthe taxpayer may not claim the credit for the\ncontested tax until the year in which the contest is resolved. \u201d34 Although literally correct,\nthe phrase does not mean that the credit may be claimed in the return for the year in\nwhich the dispute was resolved. Rather, the second part of the sentence beginning with\n\u201c(but)\u201d indicated in which year the credit may be claimed and described the application\nof the relation-back doctrine to the particular facts in the ruling. Thus, the accrual of the\nliability related back to 1960, the year in which the foreign tax was levied.-----------------reliance on Campbell therefore fails. In the instant case, --------was not the year in\nwhich the -----------withholding taxes were levied. Therefore, --------was not the year in\nwhich the credit may be taken. ---------------cited to no authority that supported its position. Indeed, its cited\nauthorities supported claiming the credits on the returns for the years in which the\nforeign taxes were imposed. Accordingly, ---------------may not claim the credits on its ----------amended return. II. When did the period of limitations to file the foreign-tax-credit refund claim\nbegin? A. The period of limitations did not begin on the due date of the --------return. In its rebuttals, ---------------relied on Campbell, as well as the 1997 amendment to\nsection 6511(d)(3)(A), to support its position that the period began on the due date of its\n--------return. The court in Campbell made no mention of the period of limitations in its\ndiscussion of Revenue Ruling 58-55, and the case was decided well before the\namendment to section 6511(d)(3)(A). Further, its conclusion \u2014 that the foreign tax\n33\n34 Campbell, 351 F.2d at 338 (citing Owens, The Foreign Tax Credit 5/3B2, at 328 (1961)). ---------------- Rebuttal 2. POSTF-113176-10 9 accrued in the year the tax was levied \u2014 was contrary to----------------- position. Therefore, this authority provides no support for ---------------- position. Regarding its other argument, ---------------made much of the fact that section\n6511(d)(3)(A) was amended in 1997.

    "text": "In addition, given the closed 3 three year statute for assessments, the Service\ncould not examine and make timely determinations to prevent erroneous double\ndeductions between the cooperative, its members, and patrons. Finally, and very\nimportantly, the tax situation of all similarly situated Coops, members, and participating\npatrons through the whole industry will be thrown into disarray. Coops will be faced with\nhaving to reclassify and file for refund (to prevent accusations of dereliction of duty, in\nseeking every possible refund) and, at the same time, will have to file returns that take\npositions that the Coops and its members never intended or envisioned. They will have\nto send corrected Forms 1099-PATR and have to deal with the confusion this will\nengender; and, they will need to face the concerns of members and patrons, who never\nintended or envisioned that their sale proceeds were going to be treated as anything but\nwhat they intended and contracted them to be, to wit, completed sale proceeds. CONCLUSIONS In summary, the claim for refund for the Coop\u2019s taxable year 20--- should be\ndenied for the reasons set forth above, including the following. First, no facts have been put forward to contradict the conclusion that, at the end of 20---------the Coop and its members (or participating patrons) considered the b purchases\nto be completed contractual purchases (closed transactions) and not open per-unit\nretain transactions; Second, the Coop\u2019s 8 \u00bd month payment period after the close of the Coop\u2019s 20--- tax\nyear for payment of per-unit retains has ended (I.R.C. \u00a71382(d)), and the period expired\nwithout the taxpayer and its members or participating patrons taking any steps to\nreclassify purchases to per-unit retains; Third, under the doctrine of elections the Coop, its members and participating patrons\nmade the choice to treat the b purchases, as such, and not as per unit retains.

Commissioner, 135 T.C. 424, 440-441\n(2010), after finding that the intangibles at issue were not, in substance, exchanged (as argued by the\ngovernment), the Court found that Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(c)(1) did not apply because there was no\nexchange. There was no purchase based on the facts; however, the Court did not define \u201cpurchase or\nsimilar transaction.\u201d 40 To date, no guidance has been published requiring the capitalization of expenditures with respect to\nintangibles not within the capitalization of intangible regulations that must be capitalized based solely on\nfuture benefit. POSTU-139175-10 40 paid to facilitate the creation of intangible assets and/or paid to create, facilitate or\nenhance separate and distinct intangibles,41 as addressed in the below subsections. A. Amounts Paid to Create an Intangible or\nFacilitate the Creation of an Intangible Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d) (hereinafter the \u201c-4(d) regulations\u201d) addresses the treatment\nof created intangibles, with other sections of the intangible regulations addressing the\ntreatment of amounts paid to facilitate the creation of an intangible. As explained below,\namounts paid to obtain ANDAs are paid to create intangibles within the meaning of the\n-4(d) regulations on created intangibles, with the professional fees at issue paid to\nfacilitate the creation of said ANDAs. The -4(d) regulations (created intangibles), in subsection (5)(i), require the capitalization\nof amounts paid to obtain rights from a government, treating such payments as paid to\ncreate an intangible. Specifically, the -4(d) regulations provide, inter alia:\n(i) In general. \u2013 A taxpayer must capitalize amounts paid to a\ngovernment agency to obtain, renew, renegotiate, or upgrade its\nrights under a trademark, trade name, copyright, license, permit,\nfranchise, or other similar right granted by that governmental\nagency. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i)(emphasis added). Payments to the FDA (a government agency) to obtain the right to market and sell a\nnew drug in the United States (obtained via FDA approval of a NDA or an ANDA, as\naddressed in Addendum A) would be within Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i). 41 To the extent Corporation X contends that Treas. Reg. \u00a71.263(a)-4(d)(9) is not applicable because the\nFDA-approved ANDAs being created by Corporation X did not yet exist so Corporation X could not be\ndefending or perfecting title to FDA-approved ANDAs, that is a moot issue since the fees at issue are\nclearly capitalizable as paid to facilitate, directly or indirectly, the creation of the ANDAs. To the extent\nCorporation X contends Urquhart v. Commissioner, 215 F.2d 17 (3rd Cir. 1954), establishes that fees to\ndefend patent infringement suits are per se outside the scope of Treas. Reg. \u00a71.263(a)-4(d)(9),\nCorporation X errs. In Urquhart, at the appellate level, it was \u201cconceded that no question of title was\ninvolved.\u201d 215 F.2d at 19 (emphasis added). Thus, Urquhart is the quintessential example of a case that\ndid not involve title since it was conceded that the case did not involve title. Moreover, the joint venture\nthat deducted the fees in Urquhart was merely protecting its earnings from licensing two patents that it did\nnot own.",

Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule\n3, line 2). 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part\nIII). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number. You must enter each dependent's social security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered\nagree with the dependent's social security card.",

The non-taxable A members\u2019 contributions are separate and apart from\nA\u2019s taxable gift check sales proceeds. There is no logical or documented relationship between members\u2019 contributions\nand gift check sale proceeds. A\u2019s members make monthly contributions based on a\ncontribution rate that is in effect at the time the payment is due. The rate may be X+1%\nor X% of \"sales\" per month.

This line, reportedly, does not include Credit\n50,000 POSTF-149051-10 10 any of the gift check sale proceeds. For example, for the year ended January 31, Year\n10, A reported members\u2019 contributions of $1##,###,###.00; and, for the year ended\nJanuary 31, Year 11, A reported members\u2019 contributions of $1##,###,###.00. A represents that it was formed solely for the not-for-profit purpose of conducting\nor promoting services that the D stores could not afford. The \u201cServices Agreement\u201d\nbetween A and the D stores specifies under Section 3 \u2013 Expenditures by -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: [A] agrees that it will operate solely for the not-for-profit purposes of\nconducting \u2026 [services]\u2026 related to B and related products and that all\namounts contributed to it by Franchisee will be expended solely for such\npurposes in connection with \u2026, \u201cB and D products\u201d and related products\napproved for sale at D outlets by Franchisor by the [various means of\nproviding the services and an enumeration of services]. All contributions\nreceived by \u2026[A]\u2026 shall be received in trust and disbursed solely for the\nnot-for-profit purposes set forth in its Certificates of Incorporation. No part\nof any contribution shall be returned to Franchisee.
