Knows that such portion if used, would result in the understatement of tax for another person. Before the Service can assess the section 6701 penalty for aiding and abetting, the Service must be able\nto establish that the person against whom the penalty is proposed meets all three criteria set forth in\nsection 6701(a). See Mitchell v. United States, 977 F.2d 1318, 1321-22 (9th Cir. 1992). If a return preparer assisted in the preparation of the frivolous business return, the Service might also\nconsider imposing the penalty under section 6694(b). Section 6694(b) provides that if any part of any\nunderstatement of liability with respect to any return or claim for refund is due to a willful attempt in any\nmanner to understate the liability for tax by a person who is a tax return preparer with respect to such\nreturn or claim, or to any reckless or intentional disregard of rules or regulations by any such person, such\nperson shall pay a penalty of the greater of $ 5,000, or 50 percent of the income derived, or to be derived\nby the tax return preparer with respect to such return or claim.

Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.6694-3(c). A section 6694(b)\npenalty, therefore, could be assessed against the return preparer if the Service identifies a particular rule\nor regulation that the return preparer disregarded in preparing the composite returns. The amount of any\npenalty to which a return preparer may be subject under section 6694(b) is reduced, however, by any\namount assessed and collected against the return preparer under section 6694(a) for the same return or\nclaim. I.R.C. \u00a7 6694(b)(3). The Service may only assess a penalty on a person under section 6701(a) or\nunder section 6694(a) and/or (b), but not both. I.R.C. \u00a7 6701(f)(2).

We do not have copies of any individual returns filed by --------- or ---------------------------------. Analysis\nIssue 1: Extension of the statute of limitations\nA. Return Filing Requirement Imposed on S Corporations and Trusts\nInternal Revenue Code \u00a7 1361(a) defines a S corporation as a small business\ncorporation for which an election under \u00a7 1362(a) is in effect for any taxable year. Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 1361(b) provides that the term \u201csmall business corporation\u201d\nmeans a domestic corporation which is not an ineligible corporation and which does not\nhave more than 100 shareholders, have as a shareholder a person [other than a trust\ndescribed in subsection (c)(2)] who is not an individual, have a nonresident alien as a\nshareholder, and have more than 1 class of stock. Section 1361(c)(2) states that a trust\nall of which is treated (under subpart E of part I of subchapter J) as owned by an\nindividual who is a citizen or resident of the United States may be a shareholder. Subchapter J (\u00a7\u00a7 641-692) includes Estates, Trusts, Beneficiaries, and Decedents; Part\nI pertains to Estates, Trusts, and Beneficiaries, and Subpart E includes \u00a7\u00a7 671-679,\nrules for Grantors and Others Treated as Substantial Owners. Accordingly, based on\nthe facts as we understand them, ---------------- meets the requirements to be a small\nbusiness corporation and is a S corporation for purposes of \u00a7 1361 et seq. Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6011 contains the general requirement of making a return. Specifically, this statute provides that when required by regulations, any person made\nliable for any tax imposed by this title, shall make a return or statement according to the\nforms and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. Section 6012(a)(4) requires every trust having for the taxable year any taxable income,\nor having gross income of $600 or over, regardless of the amount of taxable income to\nmake a return with respect to income taxes under subtitle A. Given the amounts on the\nForms K-1 noted above, we conclude under \u00a7 6012(a)(4)that each of the grantor trusts\nare required to make a return for the items received from ----------------. However, see\nthe discussion on Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 671 below. Pursuant to Internal Revenue\nCode \u00a7 6012(b)(4), a trust\u2019s fiduciary must make the return. 2 Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 671 and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.671-4 refer to trusts owned by the grantor or another\nperson. This memorandum will use the term \u201cgrantor\u201d to refer to the owner of a grantor trust and includes\n\u201canother person\u201d.

    "text": "Revenue Ruling 54-49, 1954-1 C.B. 32, provides: A specialty store on the cost inventory\nmethod does not ordinarily compute the net markon percentages for its respective\ndepartments, for this is a tool of the retail inventory method. It does, however, compute\nits gross profit percentages for its respective departments, essentially the same\nquantity. The only material difference between the two is that the former is computed\non the year's purchases, and the latter on the year's sales, and this difference will\naverage out over a few years. It is, therefore, appropriate to derive a cost index by\nreference to the ratio between cost percentages derived by taking the complements of\nthe gross profit ratios for a department. (Emphasis added)\nSection 3.02 of Revenue Procedure 84-57, 1984-2 CB 496, provides:\n1. If a retailer not using the retail inventory method selects an index from\nthe CPI Detailed Report, the selected index must be converted into a cost POSTF-134426-04 4 price index because the CPI Detailed Report measures changes in retail\nprices, not changes in wholesale or cost prices. Cost price indexes may\nbe derived from indexes selected from the CPI Detailed Report by\nreference to the changes in the cost complements of the gross profit\nmargins of an individual index category. The difference between the movements of wholesale (or cost) and retail\nprices for any given year must be reflected in a change in the markon\npercentage because cost and retail prices would necessarily change by\nthe same relative amount if the markon were uniform. The change in the\nnet markon percentage, or its complement, the cost percentage, may,\ntherefore, be used to derive a cost index from a retail price index for a\ngiven department. Nevertheless, a retailer not using the retail method\ndoes not ordinarily compute the net markon percentages for its respective\ndepartments, for this is a tool of the retail inventory method. It does,\nhowever, compute its gross profit percentages for its respective\ndepartments using essentially the same quantity. The only material\ndifference between the two is that the former is computed on the year\u2019s\npurchases and the latter on the year\u2019s sales, and this difference will\naverage out over a few years. It is, therefore, appropriate to derive a cost\nindex by reference to the ratio between cost percentages derived by\ntaking the complements of the gross profit ratios for a department. A\nsimplified method of computing is available, particularly for use when the\nbase date for the retail price index is prior to the year of adoption of the\nelective inventory method by the taxpayer.

    "text": "These amounts are retained pursuant to an authorization (usually in\nthe bylaws of the cooperative) and are computed on the basis of units of\nproducts marketed. Prior to the amendments in 1962, the Internal Revenue Code permitted\ncooperatives to deduct amounts paid to patrons as patronage dividends. Patronage dividends are limited by definition to amounts which are \u2018determined\nwith reference to the net earnings\u2019 of the cooperative. The treatment of per-unit\nretains, however, was not specifically dealt with in the code. The Revenue Act of\n1962 substantially revised the income tax treatment of cooperatives and their\npatrons but the new provisions by their terms were applicable only to \u2018patronage\ndividends.\u2019 Because per-unit retain allocations are determined on the basis of\nunits of products marketed for the patrons rather than with reference to net\nearnings, the new provisions are generally considered as not being applicable to\nthem\u2026 *** The per-unit retains may be considered as contributions to capital\u2026\u201d. See,\nS.Rep. No. 1707, 89th Cong. 2d Sess. 70 (1966), reprinted in 1966 U.S. Code\nCong. & Admin. News 4446, 4515-4516; 1966-2 C.B. 1059, 1107-1108. There is no evidence that the Coop, the members and participating patrons ever\nintended the b purchase proceeds to be per-unit retains nor evidence that they ever\ntimely changed this original intent. This cooperative does not use commodity pools, so one would expect the use of\n-------------- if they are ever used, to be a rare event, except to artificially increase Coop\u2019s\nsection 199 domestic production deduction. It is to be noted that per-unit retains are POSTF-143023-10 18 allocations pursuant to an agreement between the organization and the patron. [Emphasis added]. It is our opinion, that absent documentation or other convincing\nevidence that, the b purchases were agreed to, or intended to be paid, in accordance\nwith mutually agreed to per-unit retain provisions, what we have here are simply\npurchased price payments, for completed b delivery contracts. They are not, as a\nfactual matter, per-unit retains paid in money. There is no evidence whatsoever that any of the parties mutually intended at any\ntime, to allow the cooperative to retain any of the members or participating patrons\nequity in the b commodity. The evidence is of a final transfer of the members or\nparticipating patrons equity in the b grain to the cooperative, for consideration. This is a\nvery different concept from the concept of per unit retains, where the member or\nparticipating patron receives part of his equity in cash and lets and agrees to let the\ncooperative retain the rest, until the profit (or loss) from the sale of the commodity to\nthird parties is established by closing of the pool, and the cooperative, at its discretion,\ndeclares a patronage dividend (patronage refund). Without per unit retains, you do not\nhave per unit retains paid in money. To reiterate and clarify, in this case, there is no evidence whatsoever that any of\nthe parties timely agreed to or intended that any of the b purchase proceeds still\nbelonged to Coop. The evidence is that these b purchase proceeds unconditionally\nbelonged to the members and participating patron.",

    "text": "A number of revenue rulings and court cases address the use of a NOL incurred by a\nsingle taxpayer in a joint return year. In Calvin et ux v. United States, 354 F. 2d 202\n(10th Cir. 1965), the court of appeals determined that a spouse\u2019s NOL sustained prior to\nmarriage could not be carried over against the other spouse\u2019s income reported on their\njoint return. The court explained that the NOL provisions are personal to the spouse\nincurring the loss and can only offset the income of that taxpayer. Likewise, in Zeeman\nv. United States, 395 F. 2d 861 (2d Cir. 1968), a surviving spouse was not allowed to\ncarryback a NOL incurred after her spouse\u2019s death to taxable years in which she filed\njoint returns with her deceased spouse because the deceased spouse earned all of the\njoint income. In Rev. Rul. 60-216, 1960-1 C.B. 126, a husband and wife resided in a community\nproperty state and filed a joint return for 1954. They divorced in 1955. The husband\nincurred a NOL in 1957 that he was carried back to the 1954 joint return year. The\nrevenue ruling holds that the husband\u2019s NOL may be carried back and applied only\nagainst his share of the community income reported for the carryback year. In Rev. Rul. 80-6, 1980-1 C.B. 295, a divorced taxpayer incurred a NOL that the\ntaxpayer wanted to carryback to a joint return year. The revenue ruling, in amending\nthe rationale set forth in Rev. Rul. 75-368, 1975-2 C.B. 480, explains the procedures for\nthe carryback of a NOL to a joint return as follows: The net operating loss deduction will be carried back and\ncarried over only to the income that would have been\nreported by the taxpayer, if a separate return would have\nbeen filed. The joint rates will be applied to the reduced joint\ntaxable income. The amount of the taxpayer's individual\nrefund will be calculated by determining the taxpayer's\nrecomputed share of the joint liability according to the\nseparate tax formula: taxpayer's recomputed separate tax\nliability [divided by] both spouses' recomputed separate tax\nliability [times] recomputed joint tax liability and subtracting 11\nthat amount from the taxpayer's contribution determined in\naccordance with [Rev. Rul. 80-7, 1980-1 C.B. 296]. The\namount of the overpayment refunded to the taxpayer will be\nlimited to the amount of the joint overpayment. In computing\neach taxpayer's separate tax liability, the tax rates for\nmarried individuals filing separate returns should be used. The following is an example of the manner in which the NOL rules operate when a\nsingle taxpayer incurs a NOL and carries it to a year in which a joint return is filed. The\nexample follows the rules set forth in the above revenue rulings and cases, which\nprovide that a NOL is personal in nature to the taxpayer sustaining the loss and only\navailable in other years to offset the income of the same taxpayer.",
