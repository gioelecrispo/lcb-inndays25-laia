    "text": "\"Cost-plus\" -- the Taxpayer's references to NAIC accounting materials. As\nnoted above, the Taxpayer's refund claims were prompted by an internal audit of the\nTaxpayer's NAIC Annual Statements. Accordingly, the Taxpayer's argument is\nprincipally based upon the Accounting Practices and Procedures of the NAIC and the\nNAIC's Risk-Based Capital standards. The Taxpayer argues that the Accounting Practices and Procedures of the NAIC\ndistinguish between Administrative Services Only (ASO) arrangements and\nAdministrative Services Contracts (ASC), and that the \"Health Risk Based Capital\"\ninstructions make a similar distinction. Ultimately, the Taxpayers argument is based\nupon the line description of a \"form template\" used in the NAIC's Risk-Based Capital\nReport: The section also includes a separate line requiring a charge of one percent\napplied to \"Medical costs paid through ASC arrangements (Including Fee-forservice received from other health entities.\" This RBC instruction makes it clear\nthat the NAIC considers Program X-type arrangements as ASC-Cost-plus\ncontracts. [Protest, pages 9-10.] Contrary to the Taxpayer's assertion, (\"This RBC instructions makes it clear . . .\")\nneither the line entry nor the instructions make any reference to \"Program X\"\narrangements. The RBC materials will be discussed under a later heading. The Taxpayer's distinction between ASO and ASC is based upon the NAIC's\nStatement of Statutory Account Principles No. 47 (SAP 47) (January 1, 2001), which is\nquoted in the Protest as follows:\nUnder an ASO plan, claims are paid from a bank account owned and funded\ndirectly by the uninsured plan sponsor; or, claims are paid from a bank account\nowned by the reporting entity, but only after the reporting entity has received POSTU-144536-09 20 funds from the uninsured plan sponsor that are adequate to fully cover the claim\npayments. Under an ASC plan, the reporting entity pays claims from its own\nbank accounts, and only subsequently receives reimbursement from the\nuninsured plan sponsor. [Protest, page 8, boldface and italics in the Protest, not\nin the original.] SAP 47 is entitled \"Uninsured Plans\" and is based on Statutory Issue Paper No.\n47 (SIP 47), also entitled \"Uninsured Plans,\" which was finalized June 23, 1998. The\nmaterial quoted in the Protest first appeared in SIP 47, in the following paragraph:\nFor purposes of this issue paper, uninsured accident and health plans,\nincluding HMO administered plans, and uninsured property and casualty plans\n(collectively referred to as uninsured plans) are defined as plans for which a\nreporting entity as an administrator, performs administrative services such as\nclaims processing for a third part that is at risk, and accordingly, the administrator\nhas not issued an insurance policy, regardless of whether an identification card is\nissued. In the case of uninsured accident and health plans, the administrator\nmay arrange for the provision of medical services through a contracted or\nemployed provider network. The plan (whether insured by another reporting\nentity or self insured) bears all of the insurance risk, and there is no possibility of\nloss or liability to the administrator caused by claims incurred related to the plan. The administrator, however, may be subject to credit risk with regard to the risk\nbearing entity. An uninsured accident and health plan may be either an ASO\n[Administrative Services Only] plan or an ASC [Administrative Services Contract]\nplan.",

The total of lines 25d, 26, and\nSchedule 3, line 11, on your 2022 return\nis at least 100% of the tax shown on\nyour 2021 return (110% of that amount\nif you aren't a farmer or fisherman, and your adjusted gross income (AGI)\nshown on your 2021 return was more\nthan $150,000 (more than $75,000 if\nmarried filing separately for 2022)).

When figuring the amount on line 24,\ninclude household employment taxes\nonly if line 25d is more than zero or you\nwould have owed the estimated tax penalty for 2021 even if you didn't include\nthose taxes.

Figuring the Penalty If you choose to figure the penalty yourself, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farmers and fishermen). Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the\npenalty to any tax due and enter the total\non line 37. However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37. Don\u2019t file Form 2210 with your return unless Form 2210 indicates that you\nmust do so. Instead, keep it for your records. Need more information or forms?

From that result, subtract\nthe amount of the rollover. Enter the remaining amount on line 5b. If the remaining amount is zero and you have no\nother distribution to report on line 5b,\nenter -0- on line 5b. Also enter \"Rollover\" next to line 5b.

Lump-Sum Distributions If you received a lump-sum distribution\nfrom a profit-sharing or retirement plan,\nyour Form 1099-R should have the \"Total distribution\" box in box 2b checked.

For that\npurpose, you must take into account all\nyour self-employment income for the\nyear from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is appointed) must allocate between you and\nthe bankruptcy estate the wages, salary,\nor other compensation and withheld income tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for income and withheld income tax reported\nto you on Forms 1099.

Practice before the Department\n(a) Subject to section 500 of title 5, the Secretary of the Treasury may \u2014\n(1) regulate the practice of representatives of persons before the Department of the Treasury; and\n(2) before admitting a representative to practice, require that the representative demonstrate \u2014\n(A) good character;\n(B) good reputation;\n(C) necessary qualifications to enable the representative to provide to persons valuable service; and\n(D) competency to advise and assist persons in presenting their cases. (b) After notice and opportunity for a proceeding, the Secretary may suspend or disbar from practice before the\nDepartment, or censure, a representative who \u2014\n(1) is incompetent;\n(2) is disreputable;\n(3) violates regulations prescribed under this section; or\n(4) with intent to defraud, willfully and knowingly misleads or threatens the person being represented or a\nprospective person to be represented. The Secretary may impose a monetary penalty on any representative described in the preceding sentence. If the\nrepresentative was acting on behalf of an employer or any firm or other entity in connection with the conduct\ngiving rise to such penalty, the Secretary may impose a monetary penalty on such employer, firm, or entity if\nit knew, or reasonably should have known, of such conduct. Such penalty shall not exceed the gross income\nderived (or to be derived) from the conduct giving rise to the penalty and may be in addition to, or in lieu of, any\nsuspension, disbarment, or censure of the representative. (c) After notice and opportunity for a hearing to any appraiser, the Secretary may \u2014\n(1) provide that appraisals by such appraiser shall not have any probative effect in any administrative\nproceeding before the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, and\n(2) bar such appraiser from presenting evidence or testimony in any such proceeding. (d) Nothing in this section or in any other provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of the\nSecretary of the Treasury to impose standards applicable to the rendering of written advice with respect to any\nentity, transaction plan or arrangement, or other plan or arrangement, which is of a type which the Secretary\ndetermines as having a potential for tax avoidance or evasion.

Corporation X was the holder (owner) of the ANDAs that it prepared and filed. See\nAddendum A (addressing the term \u201cholder\u201d). If Corporation X is arguing that it was not seeking title to the\nANDAs since it owned the applications it had prepared ab initio, the argument must fail as mere sophism. POSTU-139175-10 37 with, Corporation X\u2019s actions to obtain new assets, i.e., FDA-approved ANDAs with\nparagraph IV certifications. Just the recital of the facts and circumstances, including the fact that an ANDA is a\ntransferrable commodity, provides an \u201cadverse answer\u201d to Corporation X\u2019s position that\nit can deduct the fees. See Lincoln Savings, 403 U.S. 345 at 354 (holding the\nexpenditure at issue was not deductible as an ordinary and necessary business\nexpense because it created or enhanced \u201can additional asset and that, as an inevitable\nconsequence, the payment is capital in nature\u201d). 36 B. Corporation X\u2019s Reliance on the Primary Purpose Test Corporation X argues that it can deduct the fees based on the primary purpose test. Corporation X relies on Industrial Aggregate Company v. United States, 284 F.2d 639\n(8th Cir. 1960), which predates Gilmore, Woodward and Hilton Hotels. The primary\npurpose test used in Industrial Aggregate has been rejected by a long line of court\ncases, with some of said cases string cited at the beginning of Section I of the Law and\nAnalysis, above. Corporation X may have a primary purpose of increasing its long term\nincome, but that is a potential consequence to Corporation X\u2019s fortunes, and does not\ncontrol. See United States v. Gilmore, 372 U.S. 39, 49 (1963)(\u201cthe origin and character\nof the claim with respect to which an expense was incurred, rather than its potential\nconsequences upon the fortunes of the taxpayer, is the controlling basic test . . .\u201d). See\nalso Woodward v. Commissioner, 397 U.S. 572, 578 (1970) (\u201cThe [Gilmore] Court\nrejected a test that looked to the consequences of the litigation, and did not even\nconsider the taxpayer's motives or purposes in undertaking defense of the litigation, but\nrather examined the origin and character of the claim against the taxpayer, and found\nthat the claim arose out of the personal relationship of marriage.\u201d). Corporation X also relies on Kornhauser v. United States, 276 U.S. 145 (1928), to\nsupport its position that it can deduct the expenditures because ANDA paragraph IV\nlitigation is common in the generic pharmaceutical industry.",
