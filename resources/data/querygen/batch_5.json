The notification must set forth the reasons the applicant\ncontends the patents are invalid and/or not infringed. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(B)(iv)(2010). Specifically, the notice must include, pursuant to 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.95(c)(6)(2009):\n(6) A detailed statement of the factual and legal basis of the\napplicant's opinion that the patent is not valid, unenforceable, or will\nnot be infringed. The applicant shall include in the detailed\nstatement:\n(i) For each claim of a patent alleged not to be infringed, a\nfull and detailed explanation of why the claim is not infringed. (ii) For each claim of a patent alleged to be invalid or\nunenforceable, a full and detailed explanation of the grounds\nsupporting the allegation. If neither the patents holders nor the NDA holder bring an infringement suit against the\nANDA sponsor (applicant) with a Paragraph IV Certification within forty five days from\nthe day after receipt of the notice, and if the application otherwise meets with approval,\nthe FDA may approve the generic drug. If suit is brought within said forty-five day\nperiod, the ANDA will be subject to a thirty-month stay unless the patent is earlier found\nto be invalid or not infringed, as explained in Natalie Pous, Shifting the Balance\nBetween Branded and Generic Pharmaceutical Companies: Amendments to HatchWaxman Past, Present, And Future, 19 Fed. Cir. B.J. 301 (2009):\n[i]f the patent owner chooses to bring an infringement suit against\nthe ANDA applicant within forty-five days, the FDA is prohibited\nfrom approving the generic version of the drug for thirty months\n(\u201cthirty-month stay\u201d) or until the patent is found to be invalid or not\ninfringed. If, before the thirty-month stay expires, the court holds\nthat the patent is invalid or would not be infringed by the ANDA\napplication, then the FDA will approve the ANDA upon that\ndecision. Otherwise, \u201cthe FDA will not approve the ANDA until the\n[original] patent expires.\u201d",

First, it is well established\nthat capital expenditures are not deductible merely because many members of an\nindustry have the same capital expenditures. See Commissioner v. Lincoln Savings &\nLoan Ass\u2019n, 403 U.S. 345, 354 (1971) (\u201cIt is not enough, in order that an expenditure\nqualify as an income tax deduction, that it merely be . . . paid by all similarly [situated\ntaxpayers], or that it serves to fortify . . . purpose and operation.\u201c).

How Long Should\nRecords Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items\nappearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and\n1099) until the statute of limitations runs\nout for that return. Usually, this is 3\nyears from the date the return was due or\nfiled or 2 years from the date the tax was\npaid, whichever is later. You should\nkeep some records longer. For example,\nkeep property records (including those\non your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or\nreplacement property. For more details,\nsee chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return\nFile Form 1040-X to change a return\nyou already filed. Generally, Form\n1040-X must be filed within 3 years af- ter the date the original return was filed\nor within 2 years after the date the tax\nwas paid, whichever is later. But you\nmay have more time to file Form\n1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically\nor mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. Use the Where's My Amended Return\napplication on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return.

Death of a Taxpayer If a taxpayer died before filing a return\nfor 2022, the taxpayer's spouse or personal representative may have to file and\nsign a return for that taxpayer. A personal representative can be an executor, administrator, or anyone who is in charge\nof the deceased taxpayer's property.

The person\nwho files the return must enter \u201cDeceased,\u201d the deceased taxpayer's name,\nand the date of death across the top of\nthe return.
