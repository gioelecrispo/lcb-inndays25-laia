The suitability check will be limited to an inquiry\nregarding whether an applicant has engaged in any\nconduct that would justify suspension or disbarment\nof any practitioner under the provisions of this part\non the date the application is submitted, including\nwhether the applicant has engaged in disreputable\nconduct as defined in \u00a710.51.
