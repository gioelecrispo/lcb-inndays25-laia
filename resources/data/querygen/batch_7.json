Recipients of returns and return information under\nthis paragraph (d)(3) may use the returns or return\ninformation solely in the action or proceeding, or\nin preparation for the action or proceeding, with\nrespect to which the disclosure was made. (iv) Procedures for disclosure of returns and\nreturn information.

(4) Protective measures \u2014\n(i) Mandatory protection order. If redaction of\nnames, addresses, and other identifying information\nof third party taxpayers may still permit indirect\nidentification of any third party taxpayer, the\nAdministrative Law Judge will issue a protective\norder to ensure that the identifying information is\navailable to the parties and the Administrative Law\nJudge for purposes of the proceeding, but is not\n\u00a7 10.72 \u2014 Page 37 Table of Contents disclosed to, or open to inspection by, the public.

In addition, a conclusion to the contrary would allow application of the Closing\nAgreement to companies who were not parties to the agreement. A person who is not a\nparty to a contract \u201cis in no position to invoke its protection.\u201d Hagar v. Reclamation Dist.\nNo. 108, 111 U.S. 701, 712-13 (1884). Third parties do not receive rights under a\ncontract unless the contract reflects the express or implied intent of the parties to benefit\nthe third party. See F.D.I.C. v. United States, 342 F.3d 1313, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Generally, closing agreements are only binding with respect to the parties thereto. See\nSchwartz v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1980-212. Although, closing agreements may\nbe binding on transferees. See Pert v. Commissioner, 105 T.C. 370, 376 (1995)\n(transferee of assets from his wife and her former husband\u2019s estate could not challenge\nthe deficiencies and additions to tax that were agreed to by the wife and the estate in a\nclosing agreement when IRS sought to collect from the transferred assets). Company B and Company C were not parties to the agreement and the agreement\ndoes not reflect an intent, express or implied, to include inventory acquired in\nsubsequent mergers, acquisitions, or other corporate transactions within the confines of\nthe Closing Agreement. In fact, the Closing Agreement reflects the opposite intention\nas it provides that the IRS may examine anything entering into inventory after Date 7. expired for those years. Graff Chevrolet v. Campbell, 343 F.2d 568, 572 (5th Cir. 1965); cf. Huffman v.\nCommissioner, 518 F.3d 357 (6th Cir. 2008). Because a section 481(a) adjustment attributable to a\nchange in item definitions would, in part, require a change to the inventory calculation for pre-Year 2 tax\nyears, such adjustment would be in violation of the Closing Agreement. Therefore, any section 481(a)\nadjustment would be limited to tax years after Year 1.\n6\nRev. Rul. 70-565, 1970-2 C.B. 110, holds that the LIFO layers and date bases of the transferor\u2019s LIFO\ninventories carry over in a section 351 transaction to an existing transferee also using the LIFO method. Sections 381(c)(5) provides that an acquiring corporation must compute inventories on the same basis\nused by the distributor or transferor corporation unless different methods were used by the acquiring\ncorporation and the distributor or transferor corporation. If different methods were used and the\nbusinesses are to be integrated, then the principal method must be used. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.381(c)(5)1(c)(1). POSTF-140663-09 9 While closing agreements may apply to transferees, Company B and Company C are\nnot transferees. To the extent they are transferors, the same rule does not apply. Binding a transferee precludes a taxpayer from avoiding the application of a closing\nagreement by transferring assets. To apply this rule conversely would not achieve the\nsame result; rather it would allow application of a closing agreement to taxpayers and\nitems to which it was never meant to apply.

If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a qualiTIP fying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the\nEIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying\nchild. For more information, see Pub. 596. Example. Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the\nfive tax benefits listed here based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s AGI is higher than yours and you don\u2019t claim J as a qualifying child, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 596.

However, if \u201cValid for Work Only With DHS Authorization\u201d is printed on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC purposes only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid. To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number\n(SSN) near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't\nhave an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You\nCan't File on Time? If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of\nyour 2022 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC\non your original or an amended 2022 return.

POSTU-116467-09 8 If there are substantial limitations or restrictions on the taxpayer's control of the\nreceipt of the income, then there is no constructive receipt until the restrictions are\nremoved. Where a certificate holder of long-term certificates of deposit was precluded\nfrom withdrawing principal or interest from his account except with the consent of the\nbank and only in the event of emergency, interest credited by the bank with respect to\nthe certificate is not includible in the taxpayer\u2019s gross income until the taxable year in\nwhich the original term of the certificate is concluded, unless received in an earlier\ntaxable year under emergency withdrawal provisions. See Rev. Rul. 73-487, 1973-2\nC.B.153. Courts have determined that the following conditions are generally necessary to\ntax an amount under the doctrine of constructive receipt:\n1. the amount must be due;\n2. the amount must be appropriated on the books of the obligor;\n3. the obligor must be willing to pay;\n4. the obligor must be solvent and able to pay; and\n5. the obligee must have knowledge of the foregoing facts. The obligee\u2019s demand for payment must be the only thing that would be\nnecessary for payment. See Johnson v. Commissioner, 25 T.C. 499 (1955); Jumbo v.\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo 2002-273; Gullett v. Commissioner, 31 B.T.A. 1067 (1935). The amount credited to an individuals\u2019 account must be subject to unqualified demand. See Robinson v. Commissioner, 44 T.C. 20 (1965). Information Reporting Requirements\nCode \u00a7 6049(a) provides that every person (1) who makes payments of interest\naggregating $10 or more to any other person during any calendar year or (2) who\nreceives payments of interest as a nominee and who makes payments aggregating $10\nor more during any calendar year to any other person with respect to the interest so\nreceived, shall make a return according to the forms or regulations prescribed by the\nSecretary, setting forth the aggregate amount of such payments and the name and\naddress of the person to whom paid. Code \u00a7 6049(b)(1)(B) includes in the definition of interest any interest on deposits\nwith persons carrying on the banking business. Section 6049(b)(1)(C) includes in the\ndefinition of interest any amounts paid by a mutual savings bank, savings and loan\nassociation, building and loan association, cooperative bank, homestead association,\ncredit union, industrial loan association or bank, or similar organization, in respect of\ndeposits, investment certificates, or withdrawable or repurchasable shares. Code \u00a7 6049(d)(1) provides that the term person includes any governmental unit\nand any agency or instrumentality thereof and any international organization and any\nagency or instrumentality thereof. POSTU-116467-09 9 ANALYSIS\nIssues 1 and 2 As a general rule, interest earned by a taxpayer constitutes gross income and is\nfully taxable. In Rev. Rul. 99-44, the personal funds, including all interest, are the\nproperty of the IDA participant and may be withdrawn at any time. Here, even though\nthe funds in the equity accounts are held in trust by the ----HA for the benefit of the\nprogram participants, the funds, including interest earned thereon, remain property of\nthe program participants.",
