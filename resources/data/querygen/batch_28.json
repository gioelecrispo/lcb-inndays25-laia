    "text": "To reiterate and clarify, in this case, there is no evidence whatsoever that any of\nthe parties timely agreed to or intended that any of the b purchase proceeds still\nbelonged to Coop. The evidence is that these b purchase proceeds unconditionally\nbelonged to the members and participating patron. None of the relevant parties viewed\nthe transaction as open, which is inherent in the concept of a per-unit retain. The fact\nthat the b purchases are closed transactions is evidenced by the fact that the taxpayer\nhas not shown that the b purchase payments were anything but final sales; that any\nmaterial terms of the b purchase contract remained open; the fact that no one intended\nanything other than a completed b purchase; the lack of evidence to indicate an\nincomplete or non- permanent transfer of rights and obligations from the seller to the\npurchaser; the lack of evidence that the parties agreed to allow the Coop to retain any\nof the b purchase proceeds as retains; and, the lack of any indication that the members\nand participating patrons agreed to, or were amenable to return any of the b sale\nproceeds to the Coop, if the Coop did not make a profit on their sale to third parties. The documentary evidence that exists shows a closed transaction: Prior to the\nuntimely October 20--- memo (Exhibit A), the taxpayer had not amended its Forms\n1099-PATRs to treat \u201cpurchases\u201d as per-unit retains paid in money; Even after the\nOctober 20----memorandum (Exhibit A), there is no evidence that members (or\nparticipating patrons) have agreed to reopen their closed b sales and turn them into\nopen per-unit retain transactions; The Coop and its members (or participating patrons)\nhave not agreed to amended by-laws that would change the treatment of sum certain,\nfixed proceeds from closed (oral or written) contracts into \u201cper-unit retains\u201d;\npresumably, per unit retains paid in money could conceivably be recovered by the Coop\nfrom the members or participating patrons; The Coop and its members (or participating\npatrons) have neither amended nor entered into negotiations to amend the 20--- b\npurchase contracts, either orally or in writing nor shown any mutual assent of an POSTF-143023-10 19 intention to do this; The Coop and its members (or participating patrons) have not\nenacted, let alone agreed to amended cooperative\u2019s by-laws that would obliterate\ndistinctions between open per unit retains and closed b purchases; The October 20--memorandum (Exhibit A) strongly indicates that prior to this memorandum the Coop had\nnot amended the Forms 1099-PATR for 20--- to reclassify the b purchases into ------------------------; and, the October 20----memorandum neither expresses or implies mutual\nagreement between the Coop and its members and participating patrons to the\nreclassification. The October 20--- memorandum is simply evidence of an untimely\nunilateral act by the Coop, without any indication of express or implied consent by the\nmembers and participating patrons to modify the completed b sale contracts. There are intractable problems that would be caused by a reclassification from\ncompleted b purchases to per-unit retains, for the taxable year 20---. Consideration of the year 20--- shows why the Service, in Private Letter Rulings,\ngenerally, rules prospectively and not retroactively.",

Interest income includes interest on savings or other bank\ndeposits. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.61-7(a). The Service relies on Rev. Rul. 99-44, 1999-2 C.B. 549, to support its position\nthat the interest earned on the participant\u2019s equity accounts under the MHO program is\nincludible in the participant\u2019s income in the year of allocation under section 61 of the\nCode. Rev. Rul. 99-44 held that interest earned by an Individual Development Account\n(IDA) project participant on funds deposited in the participant\u2019s personal account is\ncurrently includible in the participant\u2019s gross income under section 61 of the Code. IDAs are accounts created under the Assets for Independence Act of 1998 (the\n\u201cAct\u201d) for use by eligible low-income individuals for qualified expenses, which are\npostsecondary educational expenses, first-time home purchases, business\ncapitalization, or the transfer of IDA funds directly into another IDA for the benefit of an\neligible family member. The participants of this program deposit earned income into a\npersonal account, and a qualified entity (such as a \u00a7 501(c)(3) organization) provides\nmatching contributions under Federal or non-Federal funds. An IDA consists of two\ntypes of funds: Personal Funds and Parallel Funds. Under this program, a separate\ncustodial bank account (i.e., a personal account), for which the qualified entity is the\ncustodian, holds the deposits of the project participant. Personal funds consist of these\ndeposits and any interest earned on the funds in the personal account. Periodically, the\nqualified entity will note the amount of recent deposits made by a project participant into\nthe participant\u2019s personal account on its books. Then, the qualified entity will allocate\nparallel funds to that participant. Parallel funds consist of a matching amount that\ncorresponds to the amount of the participant\u2019s recent deposits and interest. The qualified entity has complete control over the parallel funds until they are\ndisbursed. The funds may be disbursed only for a qualified expense and only upon\nwritten request of the project participant and written approval of a responsible official of\nthe qualified entity. Disbursements of parallel funds are made by the qualified entity\ndirectly to the applicable payee (i.e., the educational institution, home seller, the\nbusiness capitalization account, or the family member\u2019s IDA.) as appropriate. 16 See Article VII of the Agreement. POSTU-116467-09 7 The personal funds, including all interest, are the property of the participant. Amounts in the personal funds may be withdrawn for a qualified expense upon written\nrequest of the project participant and written approval of a responsible official of the\nqualified entity. Amounts in the personal funds may also be withdrawn for emergency\nuses as specified under the Act. In addition, amounts in the personal funds may be\nwithdrawn for any other use, however, such a withdrawal will terminate the participant\u2019s\ninvolvement in the IDA program, in which case any bookkeeping allocation of parallel\nfunds to that participant will be reversed by the qualified entity on its books.",

    "text": "Each examiner or reviewer may\nconsider what a particular store\u2019s gift check inventory policy is and how often a store\norders, or reorders, gift checks. POSTF-149051-10 18 Issue 4: A may deduct amounts paid to D stores to redeem gift checks when D\nstores redeem the gift checks. The next issue is whether taxpayer may deduct its liability for gift check\nredemptions when it includes gift check proceeds in income. I.R.C. \u00a7461(a) provides\nthat the amount of any deduction or credit must be taken for the taxable year that is the\nproper taxable year under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income. Treas. Reg. \u00a71.461-1(a)(2)(i) provides that, under an accrual method of\naccounting, a liability is incurred, and is generally taken into account for federal income\ntax purposes, in the taxable year in which (1) all the events have occurred that establish\nthe fact of the liability, (2) the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable\naccuracy, and (3) economic performance has occurred with respect to the liability (the\n\"all events test\"). See also Treas. Reg. \u00a71.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(A). A taxpayer may not deduct a liability that is contingent, nor may a taxpayer\ndeduct an estimate of an anticipated expense, no matter how statistically certain, if it is\nbased on events that have not occurred by the close of the taxable year. United States\nv. General Dynamics, 481 U.S. 239, 243 (1987); Brown v. Helvering, 291 U.S. 193, 201\n(1934). In the instant case, until a customer returns to a D store to redeem a gift check, A\nfaces only a contingent liability to pay the redeeming D store. Thus, the return of the\ncustomer and redemption by the D store of the gift check is a condition precedent to\nestablish the taxpayer's liability. A may deduct the liability to make the payment to D\nstores no earlier than the time at which all events have occurred that establish the fact\nof the liability; namely, no earlier than when customers return to the D stores to redeem\nthe gift checks. At that time, A\u2019s liability will be fixed and determinable. Before the\ncustomers return to the D stores to redeem checks, all events have not occurred to\nestablish the fact of the liability and estimates of the amount of the liability are subject to\nthe vagaries inherent to gift check redemptions (e.g., if, and when, and in what\namounts, will the redemptions occur). Other considerations Finally, A maintains that there are costs directly attributable to the sale of gift\nchecks, mainly printing, storage, and bank fees that would exceed the gift check sales\nproceeds. The taxpayer may always claim any legitimate ordinary and necessary\nbusiness expenses under I.R.C. \u00a7162 and any other applicable provision. Assuming A\nis correct, the fact that its expenses may exceed its income and result in a loss activity,\ndoes not mean that the income is excludable in the first instance.
