    "text": "The FCC's \"clearing\" of the BAS equipment and provision of comparable\nequipment for efficient, uninterrupted BAS service, as part of a larger project intended to\npromote the general public good, is a taking for a \"public use\" under I.R.C. \u00a7 1033. In\nfact, since the FCC is charged by Congress with acting to promote the fair use of\nspectrum in the public interest, all its actions are presumptively undertaken in\nfurtherance of that public purpose. In addition, and more specifically, the particular\npublic use driving the reallocation of spectrum is the enhancement of the\ncommunications abilities of the nation's public safety first responders. Further, the FCC\nsought to ensure the continuity of BAS with minimal disruption to television broadcast\nservices to the public because BAS is a part of the broadcast system by which\nemergency information is provided to the American public. Such a condemnation for\nthe advancement of public purposes is analogous to the type of \"public use\" described\nby the Supreme Court in Kelo. Through the Act, Congress delegated plenary powers to the FCC to regulate use\nof the public spectrum. The Supreme Court in Kelo stated that \"once the question of the\npublic purpose has been decided, the amount and character of the land to be taken for\nthe project and the need for a particular tract to complete the integrated plan rests in the\ndiscretion of the legislative branch.\" Kelo, at 489, citing Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26,\n35-6 (1954). Here, since the FCC's purposes in regulating the spectrum, eliminating\ninterference for public safety users, and ensuring the continuation of BAS are clearly for\nthe public benefit, the particular details of implementation of this mandate is within the\nFCC's purview and discretion. Accordingly, the plan for reallocation of spectrum is for\nthe advancement of a public purpose for the purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 1033. C. Conversion into Property Similar or Related in Service or Use. As stated earlier, Rev. Rul. 57-314, 1957-2 C.B. 523, provides that a conversion\nby condemnation or requisition means the process by which private property is taken for\npublic use without the consent of the property owner but upon the award and payment\nof just compensation. Under I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a)(1), conversion by a taking for public use\ninto other \u201cproperty similar or related in service or use to the property so converted\u201d CC:LM:CTM:LA:2:POSTF-108806-08 page 7 qualifies for nonrecognition of gain. In fact, such nonrecognition of gain is mandatory. See Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1033(a)-2(b). With respect to owner-users of converted property, replacement property will be\nconsidered to be similar or related in service or use to the converted property if the\n\u201cphysical characteristics and end uses of the converted and replacement properties are\nclosely similar.\" Rev. Rul. 64-237, 1964 C.B. 319.4 Stated differently, the statute\nrequires a \"reasonably similar continuation of the petitioner's prior commitment of capital\nand not a departure from it.\" Maloof v. Commissioner, 65 T.C. 263, 269 (1975) citing\nHarvey J. Johnson v. Commissioner, 43 T.C. 736, 741 (1965). The broadcast stations will receive replacement equipment which will enable\nthem to continue operations without interruption and with \"comparable functionality\" on\nthe remaining licensed bandwidth.",

To provide an additional source of legal abstract fees, the\npartnership organized a federal S&L association and agreed to\nmake good any operating deficits of the association for the\ninitial 3 years. The Court held that partners paid the deficits CC:LM:F:MAN:1:POSTF-112619-02 page 8 with the explicit objective of promoting an additional source of\nfees. Id. at 595. In Cepeda, the taxpayer operated a medical practice called\nECPA. T.C. Memo. 1993-477. Also, Cepeda and other doctors\ncreated an outpatient medical clinic called VSMC. ECPA leased\noffice space and the use of facilities and equipment from VSMC. ECPA paid some of VSMC\u2019s operating expenses. The Court found\nthat ECPA made the payments, not to increase the VSMC\u2019s profits,\nbut rather to keep VSMC in operation so that ECPA could continue\nto earn medical fees from patients who were referred to ECPA\nbecause of its access to VSMC. The Court also found that by\nkeeping VSMC in operation, ECPA was able to avoid incurring the\nadditional substantial expense of purchasing equipment it had\naccess to at VSMC. The Court held that ECPA paid the expenses\nwith the underlying motivating purpose of protecting and\npromoting his own business. Id. In Dinardo, the taxpayers created a partnership to practice\nmedicine and organized a nonprofit corporation to operate a\nprivate hospital. 22 T.C. at 431-34. The medical partnership\nreceived fees from patients referred to it by hospital. The\npartnership paid the hospital\u2019s operating deficits to keep the\nhospital in operation and to avoid the loss of medical fees. The\nCourt found that the partnership did not pay the hospital\u2019s\noperating deficits with the purpose to make profits from the\noperation of a hospital, and thereby to augment the partnership\nincome. Rather, the Court found that the payments were made to\nkeep the hospital in operation in order for the medical\npartnership itself to earn medical fees from patients who would\nbe hospitalized at the hospital, or who would be sent to the\npartnership because of referrals from or access to hospital\u2019s\nfacilities. Id. at 435-436. The above cited cases are distinguishable from\ncase. In these cases, the parent paid the subsidiary\u2019s\noperating costs either to increase, or prevent a substantial\ndecrease of, the parent\u2019s own income derived from unrelated third\nparty consumers or to create an additional source of income to\nsupplement the parent\u2019s own business income. The expenses were\nnot incurred by the parent to increase the parent\u2019s income\ncurrently derived directly from its subsidiary or to make profits\nfrom the entity.

    "text": "The administrator, however, may be subject to credit risk with regard to the risk\nbearing entity. An uninsured accident and health plan may be either an ASO\n[Administrative Services Only] plan or an ASC [Administrative Services Contract]\nplan. Under an ASO plan, claims are paid from a bank account owned and\nfunded directly by the uninsured plan sponsor; or, claims are paid from a bank\naccount owned by the reporting entity, but only after the reporting entity has\nreceived funds from the uninsured plan sponsor that are adequate to fully cover\nthe claim payments. Under an ASC plan, the reporting entity pays claims from its\nown bank accounts, and only subsequently receives reimbursement from the\nuninsured plan sponsor. No arrangement where the reporting entity receives a\ncapitated payment for providing medical services to a third party shall qualify as\nan insured plan. SAP 47 uses the same language, with the difference that the first sentence refers to\n\"this statement\" rather than \"this issue paper.\" SIP 47 was issued by the NAIC to \"provide guidance on the recording and\nreporting of transactions related to uninsured plans\"; SAP 47 \"establishes statutory\naccounting principles for all uninsured plans.\" SIP 47, par. 1; SAP 47, par. 1. SAP 47\nprovides:\n5. The administrator's statement of operations shall exclude all income and\nexpenses related to claims, losses, premiums, and other amounts received or\npaid on behalf of uninsured ASO or uninsured ASC plans. . . . POSTU-144536-09 21 11. . . . Administrators shall not record aggregate reserves, claim/loss reserves,\nor liabilities (except for Medicare or similarly structured cost based\nreimbursement contracts) for any other claim costs paid by the administrator on\nbehalf of uninsured plans. [Emphasis added.] SIP 47 and SAP 47 represent the further development of the principles set forth\nin the 1986 changes to the Annual Statement instructions, described above, regarding\n\"insured\" and \"uninsured\" arrangements. While the Taxpayer's quotation from SAP 47\ndescribes differences between ASO arrangements and ASC arrangements, both of the\narrangements described in SAP 47 are considered \"uninsured.\" Note that the emphasis\nof the NAIC has been on whether arrangements are insured or uninsured, rather than\non the label used by the parties to the arrangement. Thus, the Financial Reporting\nWorking Group of the Special Committee on Blue Cross Plans had used the phrase\n\"Cost Plus/ASO\" to describe an arrangement that was considered \"underwritten.\" The\nBCBSA used the phrase \"Cost Plus/ASC\" to describe a similar arrangement in its riskbased capital formula. Both of those arrangements had multiple features that are not\nincluded in the description of an \"ASC\" in SAP 47. The most that can be derived from\nSAP 47 is that it describes an ASC which is not fundamentally distinguishable from an\nASO and in fact SAP 47 treats both arrangements as uninsured. It cannot be\nconcluded from SAP 47 that any arrangement that might be described as an ASC must\ntherefore be considered a \"cost -plus\" arrangement. \"Cost-plus\" -- TAM 9803003. As noted above, the original version of section\n833 only referred to \"claims incurred\" and did not include the language \"liabilities\nincurred . . . under cost-plus contracts.\"",

In Year2,\nhowever, X spun off many of these parts operations into a separate company, Z. The\nspinoff was a tax-free transaction under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, and\nX now claims that certain payments it received from Z after the date of the spinoff\nshould be excluded from its income. This memorandum responds to your request for\nassistance in determining the tax treatment of the amounts X received from Z after the\nspinoff. This advice may not be used or cited as precedent. LEGEND POSTF-100602-09\nX\nZ\nYear1\nYear2\nYear3\nYear4\nYear5\nYear6\nYear7\nDate1\nDate2 =\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n= 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ISSUE Whether amounts X received from Z as payment for employee expenses of\nworkers X assigned to Z are includible in X\u2019s income. CONCLUSION All amounts X received from Z as payment for employee expenses of workers X\nassigned to Z are includible in X\u2019s income. FACTS In formal and informal claims for refund filed on Date1, X argues that it\nimproperly included in income the payments it received from Z for the post-retirement\nbenefits for workers X had assigned to Z. X also claims that it failed to deduct allowable\nexpenses for the same post-retirement benefits. In supplemental claims filed on Date2,\nX increased the amount of its refund claims by excluding from income additional\namounts related to the payments it received from Z for a portion of the direct wage costs\nfor X workers assigned to Z. Your question about the proper tax treatment of the\namounts X received from Z arose in response to these claims. X formed Z and, in order to POSTF-100602-09 3 (i) alleviate competitive barriers to expanding the Business beyond sales\nto [X], [its] subsidiaries and [its] affiliates, (ii) allow [X] to overcome\ncompetitive barriers to making purchases from third-party automotive\nsuppliers, and (iii) enhance the Business\u2019 ability to attract employees and\npermit the Business to offer employee incentives more directly tied to the\nperformance of the Business,\nX transferred to Z certain X entities, assets, and liabilities in Year2. The agreements\nbetween X and Z indicate X decided to spinoff its components divisions for a business\npurpose, not that the spinoff was required by any other agreements or compelled by\nlaw. X completed the spinoff in Year2 by transferring to its shareholders its stock in Z in\na transaction that the Internal Revenue Service determined was tax-free under sections\n351, 368(a), and 355. Because X was subject to a Year1 collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d)\ncovering all of its hourly employees at the time of the spinoff, X and Z agreed that Z\nwould lease from X the hourly employees who had been working in the spun-off\nfacilities as of the transfer date. In a letter of understanding appended to the Year1\nCBA, X agreed that it would not close, sell, spinoff, or otherwise dispose of any of its\nfacilities covered by the CBA.",
