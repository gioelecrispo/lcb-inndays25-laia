For example, X indicated that, because of \u201cposting errors,\u201d it did not deduct the postretirement expenses, and it did not include in income the post-retirement\nreimbursements from Z until Year6. Here is how X treated the post-retirement benefit\nreimbursements on its original return and in its claim for refund:\nX: Post-Retirement Benefit Reimbursements Per Return\nYear3\nYear4\nYear5 Income\nexcluded\nexcluded\nexcluded\nDeduction\nnone\nnone\nnone Year6\nincluded\nnone Year7\nincluded\nnone X: Post-Retirement Benefits Reimbursements Per Claim (*=change from return)\nYear3\nYear4\nYear5\nYear6\nYear7 Income\nexclude\nexclude\nexclude\n*exclude\n*exclude\nDeduction\n*deduct\n*deduct\n*deduct\n*deduct\n*deduct\nYear6 and Year7 represent a whipsaw position in X\u2019s claim because X wants to exclude\nthe post-retirement reimbursements from income and take a deduction for the amounts\nof post-retirement benefits it paid to the assigned employees.

POSTF-100602-09 6 For the sake of simplicity, X defines the \u201cexcess wage\u201d as difference between the wage\nscale that X uses and the wage scale that Z would have used, but for the employee\nassignment agreement. X is not seeking to exclude the entire wage reimbursement it\nreceived from Z, just the \u201cexcess wage\u201d amount. In Year6, X and Z amended the employee assignment agreement to change the\namount Z was required to reimburse X. At that time, Z still was paying the assigned\nemployees a higher average hourly wage that its competitors were paying their\nemployees. To assist Z in reducing its wage costs, X agreed to return to Z a portion of\nthe reimbursement based on the cost differential between wages paid to the assigned\nemployees and workers at other similar companies, but only for new business sourced\nby X to Z after January 1, Year6. In Year7, X and Z agreed that X would re-acquire title and control of all of Z\u2019s\nfacilities that used X\u2019s assigned employees, effectively terminating the employee\nassignment agreement.

Bulger, Inventory Technical Advisor\n(Large Business & International)\nRodney K. Kelley, Revenue Agent\n(Large Business & International) from: subject: Elizabeth R. Edberg\nAttorney (Detroit)\n(Large Business & International) LIFO conformity violation This memorandum responds to your request for assistance. This advice may not be\nused or cited as precedent. LEGEND\nDate 1 = -------------------Date 2 = ------Foreign Parent = ------------------Taxpayer = -------------------ABC = -------------------------------------ABC Consolidated Group = -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tax Year 1 = -----------------------------------------ISSUES Does the Taxpayer have a LIFO conformity violation related to its provision of financial\nstatements prepared using IFRS to its lending bank? POSTS-104573-11 2 CONCLUSIONS The provision of financial statements prepared using IFRS to the lending bank violated\nthe LIFO conformity requirements. FACTS\nBackground\nOn Date 1, the Taxpayer became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABC and a\nmember of the ABC Consolidated Group. The ABC Consolidated Group filed a\nconsolidated federal tax return for Tax Year 1. ABC is wholly-owned by Foreign Parent, a foreign entity. Foreign Parent\nreported its worldwide consolidated financial statements using the International\nFinancial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) for Tax Year 1. Foreign Parent required\nthe Taxpayer to adopt the IFRS standards to facilitate the process of preparing\nthese worldwide consolidated financial statements. Therefore, the Taxpayer\nadopted IFRS for the first time for Tax Year 1. This marked the first year that the\nTaxpayer issued any IFRS based financial statements. Prior to the adoption of\nIFRS, the Taxpayer used U.S. GAAP as its accounting standard. The last-in, first-out (\u201cLIFO\u201d) inventory method is not an allowable method under\nIFRS. The Taxpayer has used the LIFO inventory method for accounting for a\nportion of its inventory since Date 2 for both tax and financial reporting purposes. The Taxpayer continued to use the LIFO inventory method for Tax Year 1. The Taxpayer provided financial statements to its foreign parent based upon\nIFRS standards for Tax Year 1. These financial statements included a balance\nsheet and income statement based upon IFRS standards. The Taxpayer also\nprovided the IFRS-only balance sheet and income statement to its lending bank. Along with the IFRS-only balance sheet and income statement, the Taxpayer\nprovided its lending bank with tabulated versions of its balance sheet and income\nstatement whereby each was presented on an IFRS and U.S. GAAP standard. Specifically, the tabulated financial statements made adjustments (including LIFO\nadjustments) to the IFRS column to arrive at U.S. GAAP. The IFRS version of\nthe profit/income of the Taxpayer was based on a method that did not include\nLIFO principles in inventorying goods. The Taxpayer did not make a distinction\nbetween primary or supplemental information within these financial statements\nrelated to the change from IFRS to U.S. GAAP reporting standards; nor did it\ninclude explanatory footnotes regarding the change. The Taxpayer provided\nthese financial statements to the lending bank in accordance with lending\nrequirements imposed by the bank related to a letter of credit. POSTS-104573-11 3",

Sub1 reports the\ncredits on its SBT returns, and the Employment Credit is refundable to the extent it\nexceeds Sub1\u2019s SBT liability for a given year. 1 The credits are not transferable or\nassignable, except to a successor corporation. 1 The Service issued a Coordinated Issue Paper on State and Local Location Tax Incentives (LMSB-04- PREF-128548-08 3 On Date3, the Agreement was amended with regard to certain deadlines for filing\nfor the tax credits, and for MEGA\u2019s approval. On Date4, the Agreement was amended\nagain, this time to clarify what jobs and property Sub1 could use in computing the tax\ncredits. For book purposes, both the MEGA Business Activity Credit and Employment\nCredit are treated as a reduction in Sub1\u2019s SBT expense. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n1. The refundable MEGA Employment Credit is gross income to the extent Sub1\nreceives a refund of such credit, and it otherwise is a reduction in the amount of\nstate tax expense under \u00a7 164. The nonrefundable MEGA Business Activity\nCredit is always a reduction in the amount of state tax expense under \u00a7 164. IRC \u00a7 164 provides for a deduction for certain taxes, including state income\ntaxes, for the taxable year \u201cwithin which paid or accrued.\u201d See also \u00a7 1.164-1(a) of the\nIncome Tax Regulations. Under \u00a7 461(a), the amount of any deduction or credit allowed by subtitle A shall\nbe taken for the tax year that is the proper tax year under the method of accounting\nused in computing taxable income. Sub1 uses an accrual method of accounting, under\nwhich a liability is incurred in the tax year in which all the events have occurred that\nestablish the fact of the liability, the amount of the liability can be determined with\nreasonable accuracy, and economic performance occurs. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.4461(c)(1)(ii)(A) and 1.461-1(a)(2)(i). Section 1.461-4(g)(6) provides that, if the liability of a\ntaxpayer is to pay a tax, economic performance occurs as the tax is paid to the\ngovernmental authority that imposed the tax. In certain cases, a liability to pay a tax is\npermitted to be taken into account in the tax year before the tax year during which\neconomic performance occurs under the recurring item exception of \u00a7 1.461-5. Gross income is income from whatever source derived, except as otherwise\nprovided by law. IRC \u00a7 61. As interpreted by the Supreme Court, gross income\nincludes all items that are \u201cundeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over\nwhich the taxpayers have complete dominion.\u201d Commissioner v.

    "text": "All cards entitle the\npurchaser the right to redeem the cards at any of the Participating A Restaurants. The\nExaminers possess an exhibit which provides the amount of the liability that related to\nthe gift cards sold by A Corporate and C. Because the amount of liability representing\ngift cards sold by A Corporate and C is a number not ordinarily used by the taxpayer,\nthe response to the request was determined based on the average gift card\nredemption rate per year for ALL gift cards sold multiplied by the gift cards sold by A\nand C.\nSummary of A\u2019s ownership interest in restaurants selling A\u2019s gift cards. In researching this opinion, we examined an Excel worksheet schedule and an\n\u201cAttachment to IDR #19\u201d that shows A\u2019s relationship and equity interest in the entities\nthat own restaurants that honor A\u2019s gift cards. 8 The schedule lists, approximately, #EE\nseparate Subchapter S corporations, limited liability companies, limited partnerships,\nand other partnerships, that own A gift card honoring restaurants. The schedule shows\nthat the limited liability companies file partnership returns (Form 1065). A has a 70%\nownership interest in one LLC (M), a 53% ownership in one limited partnership (O), a\n50% ownership interest in one LLC (L) and a 50% ownership in one corporation (N). The taxpayer, A, had no equity interest in 20 of the restaurant-owning entities. The\ntaxpayer has a minority (in many instances a nominal) interest in the other restaurantowning entities. The accuracy of the exact number of restaurants in each of the\ncategories is irrelevant and immaterial, for purposes of this opinion. The material fact is\nthat the taxpayer, A, does not own these restaurants itself, but only has an equity\ninterest or no interest at all. 8 This list of restaurants does not include C, which is owned by A, the taxpayer. POSTF-134398-08 12 LAW AND ANALYSIS Restaurants owned by an intermediary or independent entity. As to restaurants that belong to other entities, the separate gift card company problem\nis clear. As to these, A, the taxpayer, is not the owner of the restaurant (although it may\nhave a variable, sometimes nominal sometimes substantial, equity interest in many but\nnot necessarily in most of the restaurants). In our opinion, in cases where there is an\nintermediary or a completely independent owner entity between the taxpayer, A, and the\nrestaurant in question, the taxpayer is simply a full-service restaurant management\ncompany. It is not the owner of the inventory (the food) that will be redeemed with the\ngift card sale proceeds (the advance payments under Treas. Reg. \u00a71.451-1). The\ntaxpayer, A, is not the party that will be making the food sales, except for those meals\nserved in its own restaurant, C. Consequently, the taxpayer, A, can not convincingly\nargue that those other restaurants\u2019 food inventories should be deemed to be a\nsupplement to, i.e., a source of its own food inventory, for purposes of Treas.",
