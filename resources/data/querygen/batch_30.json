The\nparty who would otherwise be prejudiced by the\namendment must be given a reasonable opportunity\nto address the allegations of the pleadings as amended\nand the Administrative Law Judge must make\nfindings on any issue presented by the pleadings as\namended. \u00a7 10.68 Motions and requests. (a) Motions \u2014\n(1) In general. At any time after the filing of\nthe complaint, any party may file a motion with the\nAdministrative Law Judge. Unless otherwise ordered\nby the Administrative Law Judge, motions must be\nin writing and must be served on the opposing party\nas provided in \u00a710.63(b). A motion must concisely\nspecify its grounds and the relief sought, and, if\nappropriate, must contain a memorandum of facts\nand law in support. Page 34 \u2014 \u00a7 10.65 (2) Summary adjudication. Either party may\nmove for a summary adjudication upon all or any\npart of the legal issues in controversy. If the nonmoving party opposes summary adjudication in the\nmoving party\u2019s favor, the non-moving party must\nfile a written response within 30 days unless ordered\notherwise by the Administrative Law Judge. (3) Good Faith. A party filing a motion for\nextension of time, a motion for postponement of a\nhearing, or any other non-dispositive or procedural\nmotion must first contact the other party to determine\nwhether there is any objection to the motion, and\nmust state in the motion whether the other party has\nan objection. (b) Response. Unless otherwise ordered by the\nAdministrative Law Judge, the nonmoving party\nis not required to file a response to a motion. If\nthe Administrative Law Judge does not order\nthe nonmoving party to file a response, and the\nnonmoving party files no response, the nonmoving\nparty is deemed to oppose the motion.",

Step 3: Determination of overpayment for year 1:\nYear 1 tax liability per original return\nYear 1 tax liability after NOL carryback $31,750\n$13,206 Overpayment $18,544 Step 4: Who is entitled to the refund of the overpayment? a) Compute each spouse\u2019s separate tax liability as if the spouses filed married\nfiling separate returns: Gross income S1 S2 $100,000 $150,000 NOL deduction (86,250) AGI 100,000 63,750 Personal exemption (10,000) (10,000) 14 Mortgage interest (15,000) (15,000) Real estate taxes (10,000) (10,000) Medical expense ded ______ (35,219)* Taxable income $ 65,000 (6,469) Tax liability (assume a 25% rate) $16,250 0 * The $35,219 medical expense deduction is the extent to which the expense ($40,000)\nexceeds 7.5% of AGI ($4,781)\nb) Allocate of the joint tax liability based on separate tax liability\nS1's separate tax liability\nX\nS1 and S2 separate tax liability\n16,250\n16,250 recomputed joint tax liability X 13,206 = $13,206 S2's separate tax liability\nX\nS1 and S2 separate tax liability recomputed joint tax liability 0\nX 13,206 = $ 0\n16,250 Thus, in this example, all of the joint tax liability is attributable to S1.\nc) Determine how much tax each spouse paid. In this example, each spouse paid $15,875, which was 1/2 of the original tax liability. d) Calculate the refund to each spouse\nS2 is entitled to a refund of $15,875 because S2 had no tax liability after the carryback\nof S2's NOL. Since the overpayment was $18,544, S1 is entitled to a refund of $2,669\n($18,544 minus S2's refund of $15,875). Step 5: Absorption computation The NOL amount absorbed in Year 1 is equal to S2's Year 1 modified taxable income\ncomputed as if S2 filed a separate return for Year 1. (Note that the NOL would be\nabsorbed only to the extent of the joint modified taxable income if, unlike in this\nexample, the joint modified taxable income is less than the loss spouse's separate 15\nmodified taxable income). As discussed in Part 1 of this document, the personal\nexemption deduction and the NOL are ignored for purposes of computing modified\ntaxable income. Absorption computation:\nS2\nGross income $150,000 AGI $150,000 Mortgage interest (15,000) Real estate taxes (10,000) Medical expense\ndeduction (28,750)* Modifed taxable\nincome 96,250 Amount of NOL\nabsorbed in Year 1 96,250 NOL to be carried to\nYear 2 $210,000 minus $96,250 = $113,750 * The $28,750 medical expense deduction is the amount by which the expenses\n($40,000) exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income ($11,250)\nNote: Had S1 and S2 not divorced and simply filed separate returns for Years 2 and 3,\nthe above calculations would not have been necessary since S2\u2019s individual NOL would\nhave become a joint NOL carryback to the joint return year.

If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a qualiTIP fying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the\nEIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying\nchild. For more information, see Pub. 596. Example. Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the\nfive tax benefits listed here based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s AGI is higher than yours and you don\u2019t claim J as a qualifying child, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 596.

However, if \u201cValid for Work Only With DHS Authorization\u201d is printed on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC purposes only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid. To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number\n(SSN) near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't\nhave an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You\nCan't File on Time? If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of\nyour 2022 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC\non your original or an amended 2022 return.

Applying the Origin of the Claim Test to the Facts Before the infringement suits at issue were filed, Corporation X notified21 the New Drug\nApplication (NDA) holders22 for the referenced drugs23 and the patentees for the listed\n21 Notifications are required by law, as explained in Addendum A, which summarizes the statutory and\nregulatory regime governing the marketing and selling of new drugs in the United States. POSTU-139175-10 33 patents24 that Corporation X had filed applications with the Federal Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) to obtain the right to market and sell its new generic drugs before\nthe expiration of their listed patents. 25 The notifications specifically stated Corporation X\nhad filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with paragraph IV\ncertifications,26 certifying that the listed patents were either invalid or not infringed by\nCorporation X\u2019s new generic drugs. To support its good faith in certifying that the\npatents were invalid or not infringed, Corporation X paid patent attorneys to research\nthe listed patents for the referenced drugs. For each drug, in each notification letter, Corporation X detailed its grounds for\ncontending the listed patents were not infringed. Additionally, in each notification letter,\nCorporation X specifically reserved the right to assert the patents were invalid if the\nNDA holders or patentees brought infringement suits. Each lawsuit filed against\nCorporation X was filed within 45 days of receiving Corporation X\u2019s notification letters,\nthe time period for commencing suit for the NDA holders to obtain a 30-month stay. The stay precludes the FDA from approving Corporation X\u2019s ANDAs for 30 months\nunless Corporation X prevails in the infringement litigation. On an ANDA-by-ANDA\nbasis, if no infringement suits had been filed within the 45 day window, subject to\nconfirming bioequivalence,27 the FDA could have immediately approved Corporation X\u2019s\nANDAs. Each law suit asserted infringement pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2). As explained\nfurther in Addendum A, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) creates an artificial act of infringement,\nmaking the filing of an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification an act of infringement. Each and every claim of infringement in the law suits at issue relied upon 35 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 271(e)(2) for the asserted acts of infringement. An infringement claim based on 35\nU.S.C. \u00a7 271(e) has limited remedies, which do not include an award of lost profits. See Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U.S. 661, 676 (1990) (\u2018The remedies\nprescribed by [35 U.S.C. \u00a7271(e)(4)] subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) are the only\nremedies which may be granted by a court for an act of infringement described in 22 The term \u201cNDA holders\u201d is explained in Addendum A. 23 The term \u201creferenced drug\u201d is defined and explained in Addendum A. 24 The term \u201clisted patents\u201d is defined and explained in Addendum A. 25 It is noted that Corporation X could have waited until the patents expired since, as explained in\nAddendum A, there are four different types of certifications to seek approval to market and sell generic\ndrugs in the United States, with only a paragraph IV certification a direct challenge to the validity or scope\nof the listed patents for the referenced drugs.",
