    "text": "Since the total\nnumber of common shares to be repurchased was numbered at [X + Y], it appears the\nconversion contemplated was one-for-one between the common share classes. In variance to the Year 3 trust agreement, the stock sale agreement stated that\nthe corporation and the shareholders were obligated to pay the insurance premiums. The shareholders per-sonally guaranteed the payment of the life insurance premiums. According to the stock sale agreement, payments made directly by the corporation were\nto be treated as reducing the outstanding guarantees of the shareholders on a pro rata\nbasis. We are informed that for the Year 5 tax year, B reported $P as part of B's gross\nincome. This amount had been reported on B's Year 5 Form W-2, Wage and Tax\nStatement, as a fringe benefit. The reported amount represented Q% of the premium\nfor the policy for A, who had retired at the close of Year 3, plus R% of the premium paid\nfor related shareholder C, the only other continuing common stock owner. We suspect\n1 C was divorced on Divorce Date. This policy, entitled \"Modified Premium Whole Life,\" could\nrepresent the post-divorce striking of survivorship benefits of an earlier acquired policy. POSTF-106186-02 6 that C similarly reported Q% of the premium paid for A and R% of the premium paid for\nB. An appraisal of C's interest in the company and its related entities in Year 3,\ndone for C's divorce, valued that interest at $S. Also at that time, C owned a profit\nsharing plan valued at $T and a defined benefit pension plan valued at $U. Since the\nrelated shareholder's interests in the corporation were equal in Year 3, we have\nassumed that A probably possessed the same benefits. Upon A's retirement, A took a\nlump sum payment on A's pension and profit sharing plans. LAW AND ANALYSIS\nDeductibility of Premiums\nCogent business reasons exist justifying the purchase of key man life insurance\nby closely held corporations. Despite these reasons, the Code denies deductibility for\nstock redemption costs, as well as life insurance premium costs where the corporation\nis the beneficiary of such insurance. In the case of Emeloid v. Commissioner, 189 F.2d 230 (3d Cir. 1951), rev'g 14\nT.C. 1295 (1950), the Third Circuit expressively wrote of continuity-of-management as\nthe business purpose underlying the need for key man insurance. Harmony is the essential catalyst for achieving good management; and\ngood management is the sina qua non of long-term business success. Petitioner, deeming its management sound and harmonious, conceived of\nthe trust to insure its continuation. Petitioner apparently anticipated that,\nshould one of its key stockholder-officers die, those beneficially interested\nin his estate might enter into active participation in corpor-ate affairs and\npossibly introduce an element of friction. Or his estate, not being bound\nby contract to sell the stock to petitioner, might sell it to adverse interests. The fragile bark of a small business can be wrecked on just such\nuncharted shoals. Emeloid at 233. Despite the business need for management continuity, Section 264(a)(1) denies\ndeductions for premiums on any life insurance policy if the taxpayer is directly or\nindirectly a beneficiary under the policy.",

If the notes representing the advances to ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- and --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- were properly executed and\nenforceable, then the terms of the notes must be respected for\ntax purposes.

If taxpayer\u2019s\ninvestment in the preferred stock exceeds the value of the assets\nof -----and --, section 332 would not apply to the liquidations\nwith respect to taxpayer\u2019s investment in the common stock. DISCUSSION\nA. Legal Authority An \"eligible entity\" can elect its classification for U.S.\ntax purposes. See Treas. Reg. section 301.7701-3. An eligible\nentity with a single owner can elect to be classified as an\nassociation (corporation) or to be disregarded as an entity\nseparate from its owner. Treas. Reg. Sec. 301.7701-3(a). If an eligible entity classified as an association elects to\nbe disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, the\nassociation is deemed to distribute all of its assets and\nliabilities to its single owner in liquidation of the\nassociation. Treas. Reg. section 301.7701-3(g)(1)(iii). A\nchange in entity classification is governed by all relevant\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code and general provisions of\ntax law, including the step transaction doctrine. Treas. Reg.\nsection 301.7701-3(g)(2). Pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 332, a shareholder recognizes no gain\nor loss upon the liquidation of a subsidiary if i) the\nshareholder possesses at least 80% of the total voting power of\nthe subsidiary stock and ii) the stock possessed by the\nshareholder constitutes at least 80% of the total value of all\nthe subsidiary stock. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 332 and 1504(a)(2). Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.332-2(b) provides that \u201csection 332 applies\nonly to those cases in which the recipient corporation receives\nat least partial payment for the stock which it owns in the\nliquidating corporation. If section 332 is inapplicable, see\nsection 165(g) relative to allowance of losses on worthless\nsecurities.\u201d Therefore, section 332 does not apply where the\nliquidating corporation is insolvent since the shareholder does not receive any property in exchange for its stock in the\nliquidation. 4 Where section 332 does not apply, a shareholder is entitled\nto a worthless stock loss pursuant to section 165(g) if it is\nestablished that the stock became worthless during the year at\nissue. If a taxpayer which is a domestic corporation owns stock\npossessing at least 80% of the voting power of all classes of the\nstock and at least 80% of the nonvoting stock of a foreign\ncorporation which becomes worthless during the taxable year, the\nloss resulting therefrom may be deducted under section 165(a) as\nan ordinary loss.

    "text": "Low Income Taxpayer Clinics Help Taxpayers\nLow Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Taxpayer Advocate\nService (TAS). LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with\nthe IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition,\nLITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak\nEnglish as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, see\nthe LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate.

Suggestions for Improving the IRS\nTaxpayer Advocacy Panel\nTaxpayers have an opportunity to provide direct feedback to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) through the Taxpayer Advocacy\nPanel (TAP). The TAP is a Federal Advisory Committee comprised of an independent panel of citizen volunteers who listen to\ntaxpayers, identify taxpayers' systemic issues, and make suggestions for improving IRS customer service. Contact TAP at\nImproveIRS.org. -4- Affordable Care Act \u2014 What You Need To Know\nRequirement To Reconcile Advance Payments of the Premium Tax Credit The premium tax credit helps pay premiums for health insurance purchased from the Marketplace. Eligible\nindividuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance\ncompany. If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the\npremium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach\nForm 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year. The Marketplace is required to send Form 1095-A by January 31, 2023, listing the advance payments and other\ninformation you need to complete Form 8962. 1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace. 2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments. 3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR. (Don\u2019t include Form 1095-A.) Health Coverage Reporting If you or someone in your family was an employee in 2022, the employer may be required to send you Form\n1095-C. Part II of Form 1095-C shows whether your employer offered you health insurance coverage and, if\nso, information about the offer. You should receive Form 1095-C by early March 2023. This information may be\nrelevant if you purchased health insurance coverage for 2022 through the Health Insurance Marketplace and\nwish to claim the premium tax credit on Schedule 3, line 9. However, you don\u2019t need to wait to receive this form\nto file your return. You may rely on other information received from your employer. If you don\u2019t wish to claim the\npremium tax credit for 2022, you don\u2019t need the information in Part II of Form 1095-C.",

The touchstone for triggering the\nstatute of limitations remains the original year of election. \u201d44 Further, the Chrysler court,\nin discussing the pre-amendment version of section 6511(d)(3)(A), noted that, \u201c[O]ur\nreading avoids the uncertainty that would attend Chrysler\u2019s interpretation, which could\nlend to a shorter or longer limitations period depending on the unique fiscal\ncircumstances of the taxpayer. \u201d45 Both statements of the Chrysler court apply equally to\nthe pre- and post-amendment versions of section 6511(d)(3)(A), since the change to the\nstatute was merely clarifying. In reading the plain language of the amended statute, the phrase, \u201csuch taxes\nwere actually paid or accrued,\u201d refers to the prior language in the same sentence, \u201cany\ntaxes paid or accrued to any foreign country . . . for which credit is allowed against the\ntax . . . in accordance with the provisions of section 901.\u201d46 Thus, the \u201cyear in which\nsuch taxes were actually paid or accrued\u201d is the year in which the credit may be taken\nunder section 905(a). 47 And as discussed in part I.C., above, in the instant case, the\ncredit may not be taken in the --------taxable year. The legislative history of the amendment to section 6511(d)(3)(A) also\ndemonstrated that the limitations period begins by reference to the year to which the\ncreditable taxes relate. The amendment was enacted to clarify the limitations period\nattributable to refund claims attributable to foreign tax credit carryovers. 48 Congress\nacknowledged that the IRS took the position in Revenue Ruling 84-125 that, in the case\nof a credit carryforward, the period governed by \u201cthe year with respect to which the\nclaim is made\u201d is determined by reference to \u201cthe year in which the foreign taxes were\npaid or accrued (and not the year to which the credits were carried). \u201d49 It also\nacknowledged the holding in Ampex Corp. v. United States, which provided that the\nlimitations period is determined by reference to \u201cthe year to which the credits are carried\n(and not the year in which the taxes were paid or accrued). \u201d50\nAs a result, Congress amended the section to make clear that, in the case of a\nclaim relating to an overpayment attributable to foreign tax credits, the limitations period\n43 Chrysler Corp., 436 F.3d at 655.

Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nCases If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case, income taxable to the bankruptcy estate and reported on the estate's\nincome tax return includes:\n\u2022 Earnings from services you performed after the beginning of the case\n(both wages and self-employment income); and\n\u2022 Income from property described in\nsection 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code\nthat you either owned when the case began or that you acquired after the case\nbegan and before the case was closed,\ndismissed, or converted to a case under a\ndifferent chapter. Because this income is taxable to the\nestate, don\u2019t include this income on your\n-23- own individual income tax return. The\nonly exception is for purposes of figuring your self-employment tax. For that\npurpose, you must take into account all\nyour self-employment income for the\nyear from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is appointed) must allocate between you and\nthe bankruptcy estate the wages, salary,\nor other compensation and withheld income tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for income and withheld income tax reported\nto you on Forms 1099. You must also\ninclude a statement that indicates you\nfiled a chapter 11 case and that explains\nhow income and withheld income tax reported to you on Forms W-2 and 1099\nare allocated between you and the estate. For more details, including acceptable\nallocation methods, see Notice 2006-83,\n2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at\nIRS.gov/irb/\n2006-40_IRB#NOT-2006-83.

For details, see\nForm 8958 and Pub. 555. Nevada, Washington, and California\ndomestic partners. A registered domestic partner in Nevada, Washington,\nor California must generally report half\nthe combined community income of the\nindividual and their domestic partner. See Form 8958 and Pub. 555. Rounding Off to Whole\nDollars You can round off cents to whole dollars\non your return and schedules. If you do\nround to whole dollars, you must round\nall amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from\n50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more\namounts to figure the amount to enter on\na line, include cents when adding the\namounts and round off only the total. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. If you are entering amounts that include cents, make sure to include the\ndecimal point. There is no cents column\non the form. The lines on Forms 1040 and\n1040-SR are the same.
