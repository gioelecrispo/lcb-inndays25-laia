    "text": "Exception. You won't owe the penalty\nif your 2021 tax return was for a tax\nyear of 12 full months and either of the\nfollowing applies. 1. You had no tax shown on your\n2021 return and you were a U.S. citizen\nor resident for all of 2021. 2. The total of lines 25d, 26, and\nSchedule 3, line 11, on your 2022 return\nis at least 100% of the tax shown on\nyour 2021 return (110% of that amount\nif you aren't a farmer or fisherman, and your adjusted gross income (AGI)\nshown on your 2021 return was more\nthan $150,000 (more than $75,000 if\nmarried filing separately for 2022)). Your estimated tax payments for 2022\nmust have been made on time and for\nthe required amount. For most people, the \u201ctax shown on\nyour 2021 return\u201d is the amount on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24,\nminus the total of any amounts shown\non lines 27a, 28, 29, and 30; Schedule 3,\nlines 9, 12, 13b, 13g, and 13h; and\nForms 8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III\nthrough IX only), 8885, and 8919. Also\nsubtract from line 24 any:\n\u2022 Tax on an excess parachute payment,\n\u2022 Excise tax on insider stock compensation of an expatriated corporation,\n\u2022 Uncollected social security and\nMedicare or RRTA tax on tips or\ngroup-term life insurance, and\n\u2022 Look-back interest due under section 167(g) or 460(b). When figuring the amount on line 24,\ninclude household employment taxes\nonly if line 25d is more than zero or you\nwould have owed the estimated tax penalty for 2021 even if you didn't include\nthose taxes. If the Exception just described\ndoesn't apply, see the Instructions for\nForm 2210 for other situations in which\nyou may be able to lower your penalty\nby filing Form 2210. Figuring the Penalty If you choose to figure the penalty yourself, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farmers and fishermen). Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the\npenalty to any tax due and enter the total\non line 37. However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37. Don\u2019t file Form 2210 with your return unless Form 2210 indicates that you\nmust do so. Instead, keep it for your records. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. -60- Because Form 2210 is compli- TIP cated, you can leave line 38\nblank and the IRS will figure\nthe penalty and send you a bill. We\nwon't charge you interest on the penalty\nif you pay by the date specified on the\nbill. If your income varied during the\nyear, the annualized income installment\nmethod may reduce the amount of your\npenalty. But you must file Form 2210\nbecause the IRS can't figure your penalty under this method. Third Party Designee",

Once again, we note that\nhas\nnot presented any detailed proof that the expatriate employees\nperformed specific activities that directly increased\nroyalty income other than their general day-to-day\nactivities. In Fall River Gas Appliance, a parent gas company paid the\ninstallation, selling and miscellaneous expenses in connection\nwith the sales of gas-consuming appliances of its subsidiary, a\ngas appliance seller. 42 T.C. 850 (1964). The Court found that\nthe parent had an exclusive franchise to distribute gas at retail\nin the area and it experienced strong competition for customers\nfrom oil and electric companies, which threatened its gas sales\nand the success of its business. The parent endeavored to meet\nthis competition by trying to increase its sales of gas to new\ncustomers by increasing its subsidiary\u2019s sales of gas consuming\nappliances. The Court held that the parent had a \u201csubstantial\ninterest in increasing its own sales of gas, and the expenses\npaid by it were intended to promote its own business wholly apart\nfrom that of the subsidiary.\u201d Id. at 858. The Court also held\nthat the direct relationship between an increase in the parent\u2019s\ngas sales and the number of appliances sold by the subsidiary was\nsufficient to allow the parent a deduction. Id. In Fishing Tackle Products, a parent deducted reimbursements\nmade to its subsidiary for losses incurred in the manufacture of\na patented fishing rod. 27 T.C. at 641-43. The Court found that\nthe subsidiary was the parent\u2019s sole source of supply of this\nparticular distinctive type of fishing rod and the subsidiary\nproduced such rods for exclusive sale to the parent. The Court\nalso found that the parent needed the product of the subsidiary,\nwithout which the parent would have been unable to meet the\ndemands of its customers, and both its sales and its position in\nthe industry would have suffered. The Court held that the\npayments were deductible as a necessary business expense made to\nmaintain and preserve the parent\u2019s source of supply, without\nwhich the parent would have ceased operation. Id. at 644. In Snow, the taxpayers were partners in a law firm that\nearned substantial fees from real estate title work. However,\nfees from such work declined for several years. 31 T.C. at 58689. To provide an additional source of legal abstract fees, the\npartnership organized a federal S&L association and agreed to\nmake good any operating deficits of the association for the\ninitial 3 years. The Court held that partners paid the deficits CC:LM:F:MAN:1:POSTF-112619-02 page 8",

    "text": "I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n3111. The Internal Revenue Code imposes a corresponding FICA tax on every\nemployee equal to a percentage of wages with respect to employment. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3101. The FICA tax consists of two components, an OASDI portion and a Medicare portion. Wages for FICA purposes are defined by I.R.C. \u00a7 3121(a). The OASDI portion of the\nFICA tax applies to wages as described in I.R.C. \u00a7 3121(a)(1). This provision provides\nthat the OASDI portion of the FICA tax applies to wages equal to the contribution and\nbenefit base (wage base) defined by section 230 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n430). Accordingly, under I.R.C. \u00a7 3121(a)(1), after wages exceed the annually adjusted\nwage base ($102,000 for 2008), they are no longer subject to the OASDI portion of the\nFICA tax. Pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 3102, employers have an obligation to withhold FICA tax\nfrom the wages of the employee and pay them over to the Service. If the employer\nwithholds taxes on wages in excess of the wage base for a given year, the employer is\nsupposed to repay the excess to the employee and claim a credit for that amount on the\nemployer\u2019s Form 941 return. However, the regulations make clear that the employer\nmay make this correction only if the employee has not claimed or will not claim a refund SCAF-109502-06 3 or credit for the amount of the excess collected by the employer. See Treas. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7\n31.6413(a)-2(a) and 31.6402(a)-2(a). Some individuals work for more than one employer. In that situation, the\ncombined withholding of FICA tax amounts by the two or more employers may exceed\nthe amount due on the annual wage base. In that event, the employee may claim a\ncredit for the excess pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 31(b) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.31-2 on an income\ntax return, and if there is an overpayment receive a refund; or, if the employee is not\nrequired to file an income tax return, and does not file an income tax return, the\nemployee may claim a special refund on Form 843 pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6413(c)(1) and\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 31.6413(c)-1(a)(1)(i), (b)(1). If the taxpayer claims the excess social\nsecurity tax withholding as a credit under I.R.C. \u00a7 31(b), then the statute treats that\nexcess as an amount withheld at source as tax under I.R.C. \u00a7 3402 for purposes of\nsubtitle A, i.e., as income tax withholding. We note that I.R.C. \u00a7 31(b) references\namounts \u201cdetermined by the taxpayer or the Secretary\u201d as excess social security tax\nwithholding. The Treasury Department has promulgated Treasury Regulations to\nimplement this provision. Those regulations, found at Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.31-2(a)(2) and\n(3), provide, in relevant part, as follows:\n(2) An employee who is entitled to a special refund of employee tax with respect\nto wages received during a calendar year and who is also required to file an\nincome tax return for such calendar year . . . may obtain the benefits of such\nspecial refund only by claiming credit for such special refund in the same manner\nas if such special refund were an amount deducted and withheld as income tax\nat the source.",
