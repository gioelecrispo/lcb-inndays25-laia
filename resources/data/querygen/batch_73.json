Requirements for an\nElectronic Return To file your return electronically, you\nmust sign the return electronically using\na personal identification number (PIN)\nand provide the information described\nbelow. If you are filing online using\nsoftware, you must use a Self-Select\nPIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a\nSelf-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. For 2022, if we issued you an identity\nprotection personal identification number (IP PIN) (as described in more detail\nbelow), all six digits of your IP PIN\nmust appear in the IP PIN spaces provi- ded next to the space for your occupation for your electronic signature to be\ncomplete. Failure to include an issued IP\nPIN on the electronic return will result\nin an invalid signature and a rejected return. If you are filing a joint return and\nboth taxpayers were issued an IP PIN,\nenter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN\nmethod allows you to create your own\nPIN. If you are married filing jointly,\nyou and your spouse will each need to\ncreate a PIN and enter these PINs as\nyour electronic signatures. A PIN is any combination of five digits you choose except five zeros. If you\nuse a PIN, there is nothing to sign and\nnothing to mail\u2014not even your Forms\nW-2. Your electronic return is considered a\nvalidly signed return only when it includes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your adjusted gross income (AGI) from your\noriginally filed 2021 federal income tax\nreturn, if applicable. If you're filing\njointly, your electronic return must also\ninclude your spouse's PIN, last name,\ndate of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and\nAGI, if applicable, in order to be considered validly signed. Don\u2019t use your AGI\nfrom an amended return (Form 1040-X)\nor a math error correction made by the\nIRS. AGI is the amount shown on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11.

(If you filed electronically last year, you, and your\nspouse if filing jointly, may use your\nprior year PIN to verify your identity instead of your prior year AGI. The prior\nyear PIN is the five-digit PIN you used\nto electronically sign your 2021 return.) You can't use the Self-Select\nPIN method if you are a\nCAUTION first-time filer under age 16 at\nthe end of 2022. ! Practitioner PIN. The Practitioner PIN\nmethod allows you to authorize your tax\npractitioner to enter or generate your\nPIN. Your electronic return is considered a validly signed return only when it\nincludes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, and IP PIN, if applicable.

    "text": "According to the trust formation documents, policy premiums were to be paid\nfrom and out of the principal and income of the trust or as otherwise set forth in the trust\ndocument. No other provision specifically detailed a source of funds for the premi-ums,\nbut it is our understanding that the premiums were paid by the corporation from its\nfunds rather than by the trustee from any principal or income of the trust. Interestingly, the trust documents explicitly relieved the trustee from any obligation to\npay the premiums. A schedule attached to the trust agreement lists the policies extant at formation,\ntwo policies from Life Insurance Company, actually acquired on Insurance Purchase\nDate. Policy One provided for survivorship life insurance in the face amount of $A on\nthe lives of A and A's spouse. Policy B provided for survivorship life insurance in the\nface amount of $B on the lives of B and B's spouse. On Insurance Change Date, POSTF-106186-02 5 Policy Three was acquired with the face amount of $C on C's life.1 In Year 3, the\nrespective ages of A, B, and C were 63, 58, and 53. In Year 3, A announced that A would be retiring from active employment with the\ncompany as of the end of that year. Purport-edly in recognition of A's past services to\nthe company as an employee since Year 4, and more recently as the company's CEO,\nan agreement titled, \"Deferred Compensation Agreement\" was entered between A and\nthe corporation. Under its terms, A was to receive $D per year in monthly installments,\ncommencing on Retirement Date. In the event of A's death or incapacity, the payments\nwould be made to A's spouse for life or to A's caretaker, if any. The stated purpose of\nthe Deferred Compensation Agreement was to redress the corporation's professed\nearlier inability to fully fund a qualified retirement program during a considerable portion\nof A's employment. On Retirement Date, A and A's spouse entered into a Stock Sale Agreement\nwith the corporation and its other shareholders. A and A's spouse agreed that upon the\ndeath of the latter, the representative of such decedent's estate would offer the shares\nto the remaining persons or entities that were then shareholders of the corporation. Any shares not purchased by the other shareholders were to be purchased by the\ncorporation at the price set in the agreement. The Stock Sale Agreement contemplated that A would \"as soon as practicable\"\nconvert A's Class A shares to non-voting Class B. All of A's non-voting stock\npossessed at death was to be pur-chased for $A, the face amount of the life insurance\npolicy. At the time the agreement was executed, A owned X shares of Class A and Y\nshares of Class B. Describing the reacquisition, the stock agreement states, \"The [X +\nY] common shares owned by A shall be purchased for a price of $A.\" Since the total\nnumber of common shares to be repurchased was numbered at [X + Y], it appears the\nconversion contemplated was one-for-one between the common share classes.",

    "text": "The Court explained that the doctrine\nof \u201celection\u201d is sometimes invoked as an alternative to estoppel or quasi-estoppel. Finally, the Court explained that the doctrine of \u201celection\u201d binds a taxpayer to a choice\nmade by him between two proper alternative treatments and to act consistent with his\nchoice. In Woods et ux. v. Commissioner, 92 T.C. 776, 784-786 (1981), the U.S. Tax\nCourt (a Court of law, not of equity) upheld its authority to apply equitable doctrines and\nprinciples to prevent the taxpayer from actively exploiting the statute of limitations by\ntaking a diametrically opposite position to that which it took prior to the running of the\nstature of limitations. Claims for refund are generally heard in federal district court. These have clear jurisdiction to apply both law and equity. If the Coop were to be\nallowed to unilaterally act for its patrons, by changing the b purchases into PURPIMS,\nafter the statute of limitations for the Service to make assessments has expired with\nrespect to those patrons, this would be an unfair active exploitation of the statute of\nlimitations. The Service would be justified in asking the Court to apply equitable\ndoctrines and principles to prevent this inequity. In LeFever v. Commissioner, 103 T.C. 525, 541-542 (1994), the U.S. Tax Court\ncited a number of relevant case in explaining that the \u201cduty of consistency\u201d is based on\nthe theory that the taxpayer owes the Service a duty to be consistent with his tax\ntreatment of items, see Southern Pac. Transp. Co. v. Commissioner, 75 T.C. 497, 838839 (1980) and Kurz v. United States, 156 F.

Commissioner, 854 F.2d 755, 757 (5th Cir. 1988), cert. denied 490 U.S. 1065, 109 S.Ct. 2062, 104 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989), affg. Glass v.\nCommissioner, 87 T.C. 1087 (1986); Unvert v.

Commissioner, 56 T.C. 82 (1971),\naffd. 456 F.2d 622 (5th Cir. 1972); and, that this change of position will not be allowed\nwhen it unjustly operates to the detriment of the Service, see Kurz v. United States, 156\nF. Supp. 99, 106 (S.D.N.Y. 1957), affd. 254 F.2d 811 (2d Cir. 1958). In Radiant Glass Co. v. Burnett, 60 App.D.C. 351, 54 F.2d 718 (Fed. Cir. 1931),\nthe Court cited a number of authorities for the proposition that the election to file one or\nanother sort of return is exercised by filing the return and that it is settled that the\ntaxpayer can not change that choice later. This is true even where the taxpayer, under a\nmistake of law, was unaware that he had the right to choose. See Buttolph v.\nCommissioner, 29 F.2d 695 (7th Cir. 1928); see also Moran v.

If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a qualiTIP fying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the\nEIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying\nchild. For more information, see Pub. 596. Example. Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the\nfive tax benefits listed here based on J.
