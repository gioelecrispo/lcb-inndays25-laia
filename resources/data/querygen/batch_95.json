Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule\n3, line 2). 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part\nIII). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number. You must enter each dependent's social security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered\nagree with the dependent's social security card.",

Requirements for an\nElectronic Return To file your return electronically, you\nmust sign the return electronically using\na personal identification number (PIN)\nand provide the information described\nbelow. If you are filing online using\nsoftware, you must use a Self-Select\nPIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a\nSelf-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. For 2022, if we issued you an identity\nprotection personal identification number (IP PIN) (as described in more detail\nbelow), all six digits of your IP PIN\nmust appear in the IP PIN spaces provi- ded next to the space for your occupation for your electronic signature to be\ncomplete. Failure to include an issued IP\nPIN on the electronic return will result\nin an invalid signature and a rejected return. If you are filing a joint return and\nboth taxpayers were issued an IP PIN,\nenter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN\nmethod allows you to create your own\nPIN. If you are married filing jointly,\nyou and your spouse will each need to\ncreate a PIN and enter these PINs as\nyour electronic signatures. A PIN is any combination of five digits you choose except five zeros. If you\nuse a PIN, there is nothing to sign and\nnothing to mail\u2014not even your Forms\nW-2. Your electronic return is considered a\nvalidly signed return only when it includes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your adjusted gross income (AGI) from your\noriginally filed 2021 federal income tax\nreturn, if applicable. If you're filing\njointly, your electronic return must also\ninclude your spouse's PIN, last name,\ndate of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and\nAGI, if applicable, in order to be considered validly signed. Don\u2019t use your AGI\nfrom an amended return (Form 1040-X)\nor a math error correction made by the\nIRS. AGI is the amount shown on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. If\nyou don\u2019t have your 2021 income tax return, call the IRS at 800-908-9946 to get\na free transcript of your return or visit\nIRS.gov/Transcript. (If you filed electronically last year, you, and your\nspouse if filing jointly, may use your\nprior year PIN to verify your identity instead of your prior year AGI. The prior\nyear PIN is the five-digit PIN you used\nto electronically sign your 2021 return.) You can't use the Self-Select\nPIN method if you are a\nCAUTION first-time filer under age 16 at\nthe end of 2022. ! Practitioner PIN. The Practitioner PIN\nmethod allows you to authorize your tax\npractitioner to enter or generate your\nPIN. Your electronic return is considered a validly signed return only when it\nincludes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, and IP PIN, if applicable. If you're -61- filing jointly, your electronic return must\nalso include your spouse's PIN, last\nname, date of birth, and IP PIN, if applicable in order to be considered validly\nsigned.

Closing agreements with respect to taxable periods ended prior to the\ndate of the agreement may relate to the total tax liability of the taxpayer or\nto one or more separate items affecting the tax liability of the taxpayer, as,\nfor example the amount of gross income, deduction for losses,\ndepreciation, depletion, the year in which an item of income is to be\nincluded in gross income, the year in which an item of loss is to be\ndeducted, or the value of the property on a specific date.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7121-1(b)(2) (emphasis added). One of the separate items included\nin the Closing Agreement is the penalty under I.R.C. \u00a7 6662, but the addition to tax\nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 6651 is not included in the Closing Agreement as a separate item. Since\nagreements are only final and conclusive as to the matters agreed upon under Section\n7121(b) and the addition to tax under I.R.C. \u00a7 6651 was not item agreed upon, it may be\nassessed and collected. Courts have narrowly interpreted the items agreed upon by taxpayers and the Service in\nclosing agreements. The Court in Zaentz v. Commissioner, 90 T.C. 753, 761 (1988),\nfound that the petitioners and the Service were bound only by the matters agreed upon\nin the closing agreements and were not bound as to the premise underlying their\nagreements. In Zaentz, the Service and the petitioners entered into three closing\nagreements related to the taxpayers\u2019 participation in the Argosy trusts. The closing\nagreements stated the tax treatment of items claimed by the petitioners on their returns\nthat related to their involvement in the Argosy trusts for the years covered by the\nagreements. Id. 757- 760. Similar to the Closing Agreement at issue here, the closing\nagreements in Zaentz related to one or more separate items affecting the tax liability of\nthe petitioners and did not relate to the total tax liability of the petitioners. The petitioners argued that since the closing agreements were premised upon the\nArgosy trusts being valid entities, the Service was precluded from arguing the Argosy\ntrusts were sham entities in years subsequent to the years agreed upon in the closing\nagreements. Id. The Court found that the parties were only bound by the matters\nagreed upon in the closing agreements and since the closing agreements did not\nspecifically address whether the Argosy trusts were valid entities, the parties were not\nbound by any premise underlying the agreements. Id. at 761. The Court in Magarian v. Commissioner, 97 T.C. 1 (1991), also narrowly interpreted the\nclosing agreement at issue. The Court found the Service could assess the additions to\ntax under I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6653(a)(1), 6653(a)(2) and 6659 since the closing agreement signed\nby the parties did not address the additions to tax. Id. The closing agreement at issue\nin Magarian settled the treatment of specific losses and credits which petitioners had\nclaimed on their return. Id. The Court stated, GL-133794-08 5",
