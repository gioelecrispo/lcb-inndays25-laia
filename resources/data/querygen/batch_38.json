    "text": "Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.165-1(a).\nSection 197(a) allows a taxpayer to amortize an \u201camortizable section 197\nintangible\u201d ratably over a 15-year period. If an asset is an \u201camortizable section 197\nintangible,\u201d it is amortizable over a 15-year period, even if the asset might have a\ndifferent useful life. I.R.C. \u00a7 197(b). See, e.g., Frontier Chevrolet Co. v. Commissioner,\n329 F.3d 1131, 1135 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that the enactment of section 197 in 1993 to\ngovern the amortization of intangibles superseded older rules about amortizing an\nintangible over its life). An \u201camortizable section 197 intangible\u201d means any \u201csection 197 intangible\u201d that\nis acquired by the taxpayer after August 11, 1993 and is held in connection with the\nconduct of a trade or business or an activity described in section 212. I.R.C.\n\u00a7 197(c)(1). Certain self-created intangibles are excluded from the definition of\n\u201camortizable section 197 intangible.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(2). A \u201csection 197 intangible\u201d includes goodwill and any franchise, trademark, or\ntrade name. I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(A), (F). For purposes of section 197(d)(1)(F), the term\n\u201cfranchise\u201d has the same meaning as in section 1253(b)(1). I.R.C. \u00a7 197(f)(4); Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(10). Under section 1253(b)(1), a franchise includes an agreement\nthat gives one of the parties the right to distribute, sell, or provide goods, services, or\nfacilities within a specified area. Section 197(f)(1) states that, if there is a disposition of any amortizable section\n197 intangible acquired in a transaction or series of related transactions (or any such\nintangible becomes worthless) and one or more other amortizable section 197\nintangibles acquired in such transaction or series of related transactions are retained,\nthen (i) no loss may be recognized, and (ii) appropriate basis adjustments must be\nmade to the retained intangibles. See Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(g)(1). The abandonment\nof an amortizable section 197 intangible, or any other event rendering an amortizable\nsection 197 intangible worthless, is treated as a disposition of the intangible for\npurposes of section 197(f)(1) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(g)(1). Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1972(g)(1)(i)(B). Dealer\u2019s situation falls within section 197(f)(1). Dealer acquired the franchises\nand goodwill after the enactment of section 197, so the goodwill is an amortizable\nsection 197 intangible. 3 Dealer does not dispute this fact. However, Dealer claims that\nthe goodwill associated with the W and Y2 franchises became worthless. But, under\nsection 197(f)(1), the taxpayer cannot deduct any such loss. Instead, Dealer must\n3 In a case where a dealer acquired the franchise after January 1, 1970 but before the effective date of\nsection 197, it appears that I.R.C. \u00a7 1253 would govern the tax treatment of this type of situation. (Section 1253 was effective January 1, 1970.) make appropriate adjustments to the basis of the retained amortizable section 197\nintangibles. Dealer makes two principal arguments in support of deducting the goodwill\nassociated with the W and Y2 franchises. First, Dealer claims that the asset purchase\nagreement separately stated a goodwill value for the W franchise. Dealer reasons that\nthe remainder of the goodwill was, therefore, allocable to the X, Y1, Y2, and Z\nfranchises. We have reviewed the purchase agreement and find no such allocation. The allocation that Dealer provided to you was on a summary sheet that is undated and\nunsigned.",

How Long Should\nRecords Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items\nappearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and\n1099) until the statute of limitations runs\nout for that return. Usually, this is 3\nyears from the date the return was due or\nfiled or 2 years from the date the tax was\npaid, whichever is later. You should\nkeep some records longer. For example,\nkeep property records (including those\non your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or\nreplacement property. For more details,\nsee chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return\nFile Form 1040-X to change a return\nyou already filed. Generally, Form\n1040-X must be filed within 3 years af- ter the date the original return was filed\nor within 2 years after the date the tax\nwas paid, whichever is later. But you\nmay have more time to file Form\n1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically\nor mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. Use the Where's My Amended Return\napplication on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return. It can take\nup to 3 weeks from the date you mailed\nit to show up in our system. Need a Copy of Your\nTax Return Information? Tax return transcripts are free and are\ngenerally used to validate income and\ntax filing status for mortgage applications, student and small business loan\napplications, and during tax return preparation. To get a free transcript:\n\u2022 Visit IRS.gov/Transcript,\n\u2022 Use Form 4506-T or 4506T-EZ, or\n\u2022 Call us at 800-908-9946. If you need a copy of your actual tax\nreturn, use Form 4506. There is a fee for\neach return requested. See Form 4506\nfor the current fee. If your main home,\nprincipal place of business, or tax records are located in a federally declared\ndisaster area, this fee will be waived. Death of a Taxpayer If a taxpayer died before filing a return\nfor 2022, the taxpayer's spouse or personal representative may have to file and\nsign a return for that taxpayer. A personal representative can be an executor, administrator, or anyone who is in charge\nof the deceased taxpayer's property. If\nthe deceased taxpayer didn't have to file\na return but had tax withheld, a return\nmust be filed to get a refund. The person\nwho files the return must enter \u201cDeceased,\u201d the deceased taxpayer's name,\nand the date of death across the top of\nthe return. If this information isn't provided, it may delay the processing of the\nreturn. If your spouse died in 2022 and you\ndidn't remarry in 2022, or if your spouse\ndied in 2023 before filing a return for\n2022, you can file a joint return. A joint\nreturn should show your spouse's 2022\nincome before death and your income for all of 2022. Enter \u201cFiling as surviving spouse\u201d in the area where you sign\nthe return.",

Temporary absences by you or the child\nfor special circumstances, such as\nschool, vacation, business, medical care,\nmilitary service, or detention in a juvenile facility, count as time lived in the\nhome. Also see Kidnapped child, later,\nunder Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, if applicable. A child is considered to have lived\nwith you for all of 2022 if the child was\nborn or died in 2022 and your home was\nthe child's home for the entire time the\nchild was alive. Similarly, if you adopted the child in 2022, or the child was\nlawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2022, the child is considered to have lived with you for all of\n2022 if your main home was this child's\nmain home for the entire time since the\nchild was adopted or placed with you in\n2022. Keeping up a home. To find out what\nis included in the cost of keeping up a\nhome, see Pub. 501. Name and Address\nPrint or type the information in the\nspaces provided.

Name Change If you changed your name because of\nmarriage, divorce, etc., be sure to report\nthe change to the Social Security Administration (SSA) before filing your return.

Address Change If you plan to move after filing your return, use Form 8822 to notify the IRS of\nyour new address. P.O. Box Enter your box number only if your post\noffice doesn't deliver mail to your home. Foreign Address If you have a foreign address, enter the\ncity name on the appropriate line. Don\u2019t\nenter any other information on that line,\nbut also complete the spaces below that\nline. Don\u2019t abbreviate the country name.

You can get Form SS-5\nonline at SSA.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf, from\nyour local SSA office, or by calling the\nSSA at 800-772-1213.
