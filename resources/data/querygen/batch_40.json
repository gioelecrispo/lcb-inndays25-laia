Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nCases If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case, income taxable to the bankruptcy estate and reported on the estate's\nincome tax return includes:\n\u2022 Earnings from services you performed after the beginning of the case\n(both wages and self-employment income); and\n\u2022 Income from property described in\nsection 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code\nthat you either owned when the case began or that you acquired after the case\nbegan and before the case was closed,\ndismissed, or converted to a case under a\ndifferent chapter. Because this income is taxable to the\nestate, don\u2019t include this income on your\n-23- own individual income tax return. The\nonly exception is for purposes of figuring your self-employment tax. For that\npurpose, you must take into account all\nyour self-employment income for the\nyear from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is appointed) must allocate between you and\nthe bankruptcy estate the wages, salary,\nor other compensation and withheld income tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for income and withheld income tax reported\nto you on Forms 1099. You must also\ninclude a statement that indicates you\nfiled a chapter 11 case and that explains\nhow income and withheld income tax reported to you on Forms W-2 and 1099\nare allocated between you and the estate. For more details, including acceptable\nallocation methods, see Notice 2006-83,\n2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at\nIRS.gov/irb/\n2006-40_IRB#NOT-2006-83. Community Property States\nCommunity property states include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington,\nand Wisconsin. If you and your spouse\nlived in a community property state, you\nmust usually follow state law to determine what is community income and\nwhat is separate income. For details, see\nForm 8958 and Pub. 555. Nevada, Washington, and California\ndomestic partners. A registered domestic partner in Nevada, Washington,\nor California must generally report half\nthe combined community income of the\nindividual and their domestic partner. See Form 8958 and Pub. 555. Rounding Off to Whole\nDollars You can round off cents to whole dollars\non your return and schedules. If you do\nround to whole dollars, you must round\nall amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from\n50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more\namounts to figure the amount to enter on\na line, include cents when adding the\namounts and round off only the total. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. If you are entering amounts that include cents, make sure to include the\ndecimal point. There is no cents column\non the form. The lines on Forms 1040 and\n1040-SR are the same. ReferenCAUTION ces to lines in the following instructions refer to the line on either\nform. ! Line 1a\nTotal Amount From Form(s)\nW-2, Box 1\nEnter the total amount from Form(s)\nW-2, box 1.

See Pub. 519 for details. Married Filing Separately\nCheck the \u201cMarried filing separately\u201d\nbox at the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nif you are married, at the end of 2022,\nand file a separate return. Enter your\nspouse\u2019s name in the entry space below\nthe filing status checkboxes. Be sure to\nenter your spouse\u2019s SSN or Individual\nTaxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)\nin the space for spouse\u2019s SSN on Form\n1040 or 1040-SR. If your spouse doesn\u2019t\nhave and isn\u2019t required to have an SSN\nor ITIN, enter \u201cNRA\u201d in the entry space\nbelow the filing status checkboxes. For electronic filing, enter the spouse's name or \u201cNRA\u201d if the spouse\ndoesn\u2019t have an SSN or ITIN in the en- try space below the filing status checkboxes. If you are married and file a separate\nreturn, you generally report only your\nown income, deductions, and credits. Generally, you are responsible only for\nthe tax on your own income. Different\nrules apply to people in community\nproperty states; see Pub. 555. However, you will usually pay more\ntax than if you use another filing status\nfor which you qualify. Also, if you file a\nseparate return, you can't take the student loan interest deduction or the education credits, and you will only be able\nto take the earned income credit and\nchild and dependent care credit in very\nlimited circumstances. You also can't\ntake the standard deduction if your\nspouse itemizes deductions.

You are considered unmarried for this purpose if any\nof the following applies. \u2022 You were legally separated according to your state law under a decree of\ndivorce or separate maintenance at the\nend of 2022. But if, at the end of 2022,\nyour divorce wasn't final (an interlocutory decree), you are considered married. \u2022 You are married but lived apart\nfrom your spouse for the last 6 months\nof 2022 and you meet the other rules under Married persons who live apart, later. \u2022 You are married and your spouse\nwas a nonresident alien at any time during the year and the election to treat the\nalien spouse as a resident alien is not\nmade.
