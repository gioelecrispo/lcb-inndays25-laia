Extended active duty\nis military duty ordered for an indefinite period or for a period\nof more than 90 days. Once you begin serving extended active\nduty, you are considered to be on extended active duty even if\nyou don\u2019t serve more than 90 days. Nonresident aliens. If your filing status is married filing jointly, go to Step 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't take the EIC. Enter\n\u201cNo\u201d on the dotted line next to line 27. Permanently and totally disabled. A person is permanently\nand totally disabled if, at any time in 2022, the person couldn't\nengage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical\nor mental condition and a doctor has determined that this condition (a) has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at\nleast a year, or (b) can be expected to lead to death. Qualifying child of more than one person. Even if a child\nmeets the conditions to be the qualifying child of more than one\nperson, only one person can claim the child as a qualifying child\nfor all of the following tax benefits, unless the special rule for\nChildren of divorced or separated parents under Who Qualifies\nas Your Dependent, earlier, applies. 1. Child tax credit, credit for other dependents, and additional child tax credit (lines 19 and 28). 2. Head of household filing status. 3. Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule\n3, line 2). 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part\nIII). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). -41- Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply.

It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022",

The auditors required this correction\nbecause the Program X obligations meet the basic definition of an ASC/Cost-plus\nplan in SAP 47, in that they require Taxpayer to pay medical claims out of its own\nbank account before it is reimbursed. To repeat, under a Cost-plus contract, the\nadministrator pays a medical claim (the cost) out of its own bank account, and\nthen receives reimbursement of the cost, plus a fee for the recovery of its\nexpenses and for profit. Taxpayer's Refund Claims -- The required correction to its Annual Statement\nreporting for Year 6 prompted Taxpayer to identity three programs that should\nhave been included in the special deduction formula and file refund claims in\nopen years reporting its entitlement to a special deduction. These were the\nProgram X and the Program Y and the Program Z arrangements discussed\nbelow. The Program X claim payments are by far the most significant.

Allegedly, the Corp D controller estimated the revenues\nfrom the last two categories and overstated said revenues.
