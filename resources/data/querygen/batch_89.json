How Long Should\nRecords Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items\nappearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and\n1099) until the statute of limitations runs\nout for that return. Usually, this is 3\nyears from the date the return was due or\nfiled or 2 years from the date the tax was\npaid, whichever is later. You should\nkeep some records longer. For example,\nkeep property records (including those\non your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or\nreplacement property. For more details,\nsee chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return\nFile Form 1040-X to change a return\nyou already filed. Generally, Form\n1040-X must be filed within 3 years af- ter the date the original return was filed\nor within 2 years after the date the tax\nwas paid, whichever is later. But you\nmay have more time to file Form\n1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically\nor mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. Use the Where's My Amended Return\napplication on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return. It can take\nup to 3 weeks from the date you mailed\nit to show up in our system. Need a Copy of Your\nTax Return Information? Tax return transcripts are free and are\ngenerally used to validate income and\ntax filing status for mortgage applications, student and small business loan\napplications, and during tax return preparation.

A personal representative can be an executor, administrator, or anyone who is in charge\nof the deceased taxpayer's property. If\nthe deceased taxpayer didn't have to file\na return but had tax withheld, a return\nmust be filed to get a refund. The person\nwho files the return must enter \u201cDeceased,\u201d the deceased taxpayer's name,\nand the date of death across the top of\nthe return. If this information isn't provided, it may delay the processing of the\nreturn. If your spouse died in 2022 and you\ndidn't remarry in 2022, or if your spouse\ndied in 2023 before filing a return for\n2022, you can file a joint return.

CONCLUSION: The complaints giving rise to the causes of action against taxpayers should be obtained\nand reviewed along with the evidence supporting the claims. If the taxpayers engaged\nin intentional wrongdoing, they would not be entitled to relief under I.R.C. \u00a7 1341. The\ntaxpayers may be entitled to relief if they made deductible payments pursuant to a\nsettlement agreement negotiated in good faith by the parties to establish liability. FACTS:\nThe taxpayers provided consulting and administrative services to hospitals with alcohol\nand substance abuse programs. The United States contended that, during the period\nfrom ----------------------to --------------------------, the taxpayers entered into \u201cadministrative POSTS-152317-07 2 services agreements\u201d with hospitals that paid taxpayers for providing the hospitals with\nreferrals. In connection with these agreements, the taxpayers allegedly \u201cknowingly\ncaused the hospitals to submit to the United States false or fraudulent claims for\npayment to the -------------------------for alcohol and substance abuse services the\nhospitals provided to patients referred by [taxpayers].\u201d On ----------------------, -------------------, who owned the majority of the shares of both\ntaxpayers, entered into an agreement with the United States and ------------------ to settle\nwhistle blower lawsuits. ------------ brought a lawsuit, in which the United States\nintervened in part, in the United States District Court for the ------------------------------------------ under the whistle blower provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 37293733. The United States also filed a complaint against the taxpayers under the whistle\nblower provisions of the False Claims Act. In the settlement agreement, the taxpayers did not admit to any wrongdoing or improper\nconduct on their part. Nor did the United States concede that its claims had no basis. The parties reached the settlement in order \u201cto avoid the delay, uncertainty,\ninconvenience, and expense of protracted litigation.\u201d Pursuant to the agreement, the\ntaxpayers agreed to pay the United States $------------------, plus interest. The settlement\npayment chart shows a payment of $--------------- on ---------------------- and a payment of\n$---------------, plus accrued interest, on --------------------------. The chart also shows that\nthe taxpayers were to make two payments of $--------------- each, plus accrued interest,\nin both ------- and ------- and a final payment of $---------------, plus accrued interest, in ----------. The United States agreed to pay $---------------, ---% of the settlement amount, to\n-------------as the whistle blower. The taxpayers are Sub-Chapter S corporations owned ---% by --------------------and ---%\nby ----------------(collectively \u201cthe shareholders\u201d). On their federal income tax returns,\nForms 1120S, for taxable year -------, taxpayers reported as other deductions \u201crefund of\nprior years income.\u201d Taxpayer --------------------------------deducted $---------------, while\ntaxpayer -------------------------------------------deducted $---------------. The total of these\namounts, $---------------, equals the payments that the taxpayers were to make in ------pursuant to the settlement agreement. These deductions increased the ordinary business losses for both taxpayers.",
