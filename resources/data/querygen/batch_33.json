For more information, see Pub. 5027. The IRS doesn't initiate contact with\ntaxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS\ndoesn't request detailed personal information through email or ask taxpayers\nfor the PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access information for their\ncredit card, bank, or other financial accounts.

    "text": "The Year 3 existence of C's profit sharing and pension plans, aggregating\nthen to over a half-million dollars, may belie the company's assertion of a past inability\nto fully fund a pension plan for A who possessed an equal ownership interest to C. In\nfact, the revenue agent has informed us that indeed A did possess similar plans to C,\nbut A exchanged such for a lump-sum payout at A's retirement. POSTF-106186-02 13 Shortly after A's retirement, A exchanged A's Class A stock for an equal number\nof non-voting Class B common stock consistent with the Year 6 Stock Sale Agreement. The relevant documents are unclear as to what consideration A received in exchange\nfor A's 1/3 voting interest in the company. While A's Year 6 Stock Sale Agreement\nreflects that there was a one-for-one conversion of Class A voting stock for Class B\nnon-voting, the agreement does not state whether additional consideration was paid to\nA for A's voting rights. If additional\nconsidera-tion was not received, taxpayer's one-for-one exchange of voting stock for\nnon-voting stock raises questions about the exchange. Taxpayer may argue that prior to the Year 6 Stock Sale Agreement, the amount\nthat A's heirs were to receive on the stock redemption was uncertain. The Year 2 Stock\nRedemption Agreement, although reflecting that the repurchase was to be made\nprimarily using life insurance proceeds, failed to specify an amount for the reacquisition. The agreement did direct that the stock's redemption price would be determined by\nreference to the corpora-tion's book value. In Year 3, A's life was insured by a policy in\nthe amount of $A, although it was not made explicit in the trust document between the\nrelevant parties whether this amount constituted the total redemption price. Presumably, reference would have been to the Year 2 agreement which directed that\nstock value for the redemption would be determined by reference to date of death\ncorporate book value. By couching the monthly pay-ments as deferred compensation\nrather than dividends or redemp-tion installment payments, the corporation can take\ndeductions otherwise unavailable. POSTF-106186-02 14 Correspondingly, since the annuity was to be\npaid to A and then to A's spouse, the amount to be paid by the corporate taxpayer is\nsomewhat open-ended. In Year 3, A was aged 63. Fundamentally, the true character of\nwhat transpired requires a determination of the value of the business at the time of A's\nretirement, the value of the annuity, and expectations regarding interest and corporate\ngrowth. The question as to when a redemption is consummated for tax purposes is a\npractical one to be decided by weighing all of the various factors. Estate of Oscar L.\nMathis v. Commissioner, 47 T.C. 248 (1966); Isidore Himmel v. Commissioner, 41 T.C.\n62 (1963), rev'd on other grounds, 338 F.2d 815 (2d Cir. 1964); In re Lukens' Estate v.\nCommissioner, 246 F.2d 403 (3d Cir. 1957), rev'g 26 T.C. 900 (1956). It is also clear\nthat \u00a7 302(b)(3) contains no prohibition against payment of the redemption price on an\ninstallment basis. Lisle v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1976-140, 35 T.C.M. 627, 635.",

    "text": "1. Child tax credit and credit for other dependents (line 19)\nand additional child tax credit (line 28). 2. Head of household filing status. 3. Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule\n3, line 2). 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part\nIII). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number. You must enter each dependent's social security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered\nagree with the dependent's social security card.",

Law\nI.R.C. \u00a7 162(a) allows as a deduction \u201call the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or\nincurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.\u201d Reg. \u00a7 1.162-2 allows a taxpayer to deducted travel expenses that are \u201creasonable and\nnecessary in the conduct of the taxpayer\u2019s business and directly attributable to it.\u201d It further\nstates that \u201cif the trip is undertaken for other than business purposes, the travel fares and\nexpenses incident to travel are personal expenses . . .\u201d\n\u201cNecessary,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 162(a), means that the expense is appropriate and\nhelpful, rather than absolutely essential. Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 113 (1933). But if there are other, more economical and practical means of attaining a result, the\nexpense is not reasonable and, therefore, not necessary. A.S. Barber, Inc. v. United\nStates, 85-1 USTC P 9138 (D. Mo. 1984); Sherman v. Commissioner, 44 TCM 1324, 1326\n(1982); Ciaravella v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1998-31. Under Reg. \u00a7 1.162-1(a), a\ncorporation may deduct expenses for advertising and promotion. In determining the\nextent to which advertising expenses are reasonable, the court will compare the amount\nexpended for the activity in question with the amount of benefit reasonably expected to be\nderived. Ciaravella v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1998-31; Mathes v. Commissioner, T.C.\nMemo. 1990-483. An expenditure that benefits employees in a private setting does not promote or\nadvertise the taxpayer\u2019s business to the world of customers and is therefore not deductible. Quarrier Diner, Inc. v. Commissioner, 22 TCM 276, 279 (1963). The advertising must be\ndirected toward those constituting the taxpayer\u2019s market or business environment. U.S.\nEquipment Co. v. Commissioner, 22 TCM 1309, 1321 (1963). The lack of exposure to\ngroups from whom the taxpayer\u2019s business contacts or customers are likely to emerge\nprecludes deduction of the expense. W.D. Gale, Inc. v. Commissioner, 297 F.2d 270, 271\n(6th Cir. 1961). The payment by one taxpayer of an expense of another taxpayer\u2019s trade or business is\nnot deductible. Deputy v. DuPont, 308 U.S. 488, 494 (1940). As a general rule, the trade\nor business of a corporation is not also a trade or business of its share-holders. Whipple v. CC:LM:RFPH:CHI:2:M:POSTF-130690-11 Page 6 Commissioner, 373 U.S. 193, 202 (1963).

    "text": "In that event, the employer may\ntreat the advance earned income credit which exceeds the employment taxes due as an\nadvance payment of such employment taxes. I.R.C. \u00a7 3507(d)(3). The Service has encountered situations where the employer has falsely\noverstated the advanced earned income credit claimed on Forms 941, 943, or 944. You\nwant to know the correct procedure for recovering a refund resulting from such a false\nclaim. Since this credit is treated as an offset to certain employment taxes and the\nexcess is treated as a payment of such employment taxes, generally the audit\nprocedures on employment taxes will apply. You have specifically asked if deficiency procedures apply. They do not. The\ndefinition of a deficiency found in section 6211 applies to income, estate and gift taxes\nimposed by Subtitles A and B and to excise taxes imposed by chapters 41, 42, 43 and POSTN-119570-10/SCAF-106587-10 page 11 44. The deficiency procedures as described in section 6211 do not apply to\nemployment taxes, which are imposed under Subtitle C. The authority to assess and collect underpayments of employment taxes,\nincluding FICA taxes, RRTA taxes, and income tax withholding, is found in section\n6201. When the taxpayer has underpaid the tax, the taxpayer can agree to an\nadjustment, which can be interest-free. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6205 and Rev. Rul. 2009-39,\n2009-52 I.R.B. 951. You have also asked whether the Service could assess the liability using math\nerror procedures. There are two possible math error procedures:\n(1) assessment of a liability under section 6213(b)(1) which if challenged\nmust be abated and a notice of deficiency issued as provided for in\nsection 6213(b)(2);\n(2) assessment of overstated withholding or estimated income tax under\nsection 6201(a)(3). We conclude that neither of these procedures is available. The procedures\nunder section 6213 deal with income, estate, gift and some excise taxes which are\nsubject to notice of deficiency procedures. The Service should deal with the false\nadvanced earned income credit on an employer\u2019s return using employment tax\nprocedures. Assessments under section 6201(a)(3) are made using math error procedures\nbut without the right of the taxpayer to challenge the assessment and force it to notice of\ndeficiency procedures. The assessment authority under section 6201(a)(3) only applies\nto overstatements of income tax withholding or estimated income tax payments. The\nadvanced earned income credit does not qualify as either income tax withholding or as\nestimated income tax payments. If the Service identified the credit for advanced earned income credit payments\nas false before it gave the taxpayer credit by offsetting any overpayment to other\nperiods or before it refunded the credit, the Service could just reverse the false credit. This would create a balance due on the account or reduce the amount of any\noverpayment on the account. If the Service has already applied the excess credit to\nother periods or refunded the credit, then you would need to use normal employment\ntax audit procedures to make the adjustment and assessment.
