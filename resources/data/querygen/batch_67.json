Because X became eligible for a full retirement benefit in May,\nthe month after X turned 66, X can exclude only four months (January through\nApril) of their annual benefit from their\nincome ($6,000).",

This advice may not be used or cited as precedent.

Whether taxpayer failed to establish the fair market value of its assets to the\nsatisfaction of the Commissioner. POSFTF-123604-02 2 2.\nWhether the Commissioner may require taxpayer to use the tax book value\nmethod of apportionment. CONCLUSIONS 1.\nGiven the facts at hand, we believe that the taxpayer failed to establish the fair\nmarket value of its assets. 2.\nBased upon the facts at hand, the taxpayer failed to establish the value of a\nsubstantial portion of its assets, permitting the Service to reject the taxpayer's election\nof the fair market value method and place the taxpayer on the tax book value method of\napportionment. FACTS ---------------------------------------------is a------------------------------------company\nheadquartered in ------. ------'s 19--- through 19--- tax years are currently under audit by\nLMSB Examination. For the years under audit, ------ claimed foreign tax credits (FTC) in\nthe amounts of $-------------, $----------------and $---------------, respectively, and filed Forms\n1118 computing the allowable FTC. According to the taxpayer, the value of its foreign\nand worldwide assets for each of the tax years were as follows:\nAssets Reported in Millions1\nTax Years\nWorldwide Assets\nForeign Assets\nPercentage Foreign Assets ----------- ---------- ----------- ------------- ------------- ------------- -----4.5% -----2% -----4% In considering the values ascribed by the taxpayer, the international examiner\nhas noted that during the tax years at issue, ------ made five major foreign investments. During 19---, ------ invested approximately $------------- to acquire a 50% interest in a ---------------------------------------company, known as -------------2, and started the construction\n1 2 Asset amounts were reported on the taxpayer's Forms 1118. It is worthwhile to note that the taxpayer's 19--- FMV determination did not consider\nthat ------ wrote down the ------------- assets by approximately $------------- for book\npurposes. POSFTF-123604-02 3 of two ------------------in -------- for an additional outlay of approximately $-----------------. In\n19---, ------ acquired a 100% interest in -------------, a-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------company, for\napproximately $-------------------, and a 20% interest in another ------------- company\nknown as ------------------, for approximately $---------------. Finally, in 19---, ------ invested\napproximately $----------------to obtain a 50% interest in a ----------------------company\ncalled -------. Schedule H, Part II of Form 1118 allows the computation of the interest expense\napportionment and contains the election to use either the fair market value or tax book\nvalue method of apportionment. ------ elected the fair market value (the \"FMV\") method\nfor 19---, 19---, and 19---.3 Notwithstanding ------'s election to use the FMV method,\nExam has been informed by the taxpayer that asset valuations were not conducted for\nany of the years under audit.

    "text": "The basis would be no more than $ R (the $ T\npurchase price paid for the assets ** months prior to the sale less the $ GG amount\nCorp F allocated to the retained W, assuming the allocation was not understated). The\none gross profit ratio, computed with the correct amounts, applies to each principal\npayment starting with the very first payment; there is no separate zero percent gross\nprofit ratio for the initial principal payments. This position should be asserted as an\nalternative to the treatment in issue one, above, if the case is unagreed. Corp F concurs that, if a sale, the form of its transaction is a contingent payment\nsale with Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-1(c) applicable, but argues the sale is divisible\ninto seven separate sales with potentially seven different gross profit ratios, applied\nserially. According to Corp F, each sale represents a sale of assets within a single\nasset class. Corp F argues that separate sale treatment with different gross profit ratios\nis mandated by Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1060-1(c)(2) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.338-6. Thus, Corp F\nconcludes it can treat payments up to the fair market value in each separate class as a\nseparate sale with the result that no gain is reportable, at all, until it starts receiving\npayments for the Class VII asset sale. In other words, in effect, the one gross profit\nratio correctly computed as stated above, cannot apply to any payment until $ T cash is\nreceived tax free because the first six sales have a zero gross profit ratio in that the cost\nbasis equals the selling price in each sale. Corp F relies primarily upon Priv. Ltr. Rul. 200004040 (October 29, 1999) to\nsupport its position. 2000 WL 92408 (IRS PLR) issued January 28, 2001/October 29,\n1999. PLR 200004040 addresses six ruling requests with respect to application of\nI.R.C. \u00a7 468 on nuclear decommissioning and its interrelationship with I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 671678 (grantor trusts), \u00a7 165, and \u00a71060. Corp F focuses on ruling request number four\nwherein the PLR addresses the acquiring taxpayer\u2019s basis in nonqualified\ndecommissioning funds in the context of the first three rulings on \u00a7 468. Corp F applies\nthe rulings with respect to the purchaser to itself, as seller, relying on conformity of\ntreatment. The taxpayer-purchaser in the PLR argued \u00a7 1060 did not apply so the assumed\ndecommissioning liability could be allocated to its cost basis in the nonqualified funds. In response, the PLR notes that the assumed liability cannot be treated as incurred for\nfederal income tax purposed until economic performance, citing to Reg. \u00a7\u00a71.4461(c)(1)(i)(ii)(A) and 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), then finding economic performance does not\noccur for decommissioning obligations until the costs are incurred in satisfaction of the\nliability \u2013 an event that may not occur for sixty years in the situation addressed. Hence\nthe basis was limited to the cash component. 27 There is a possibility the working capital note could be a contribution to capital; however, there are\ninsufficient facts to support that treatment as the case is presented. Should the taxpayer provide\nadditional information, please request supplemental advice. Page 29 of 37 POSTF-134629-07",

The total of lines 25d, 26, and\nSchedule 3, line 11, on your 2022 return\nis at least 100% of the tax shown on\nyour 2021 return (110% of that amount\nif you aren't a farmer or fisherman, and your adjusted gross income (AGI)\nshown on your 2021 return was more\nthan $150,000 (more than $75,000 if\nmarried filing separately for 2022)). Your estimated tax payments for 2022\nmust have been made on time and for\nthe required amount. For most people, the \u201ctax shown on\nyour 2021 return\u201d is the amount on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24,\nminus the total of any amounts shown\non lines 27a, 28, 29, and 30; Schedule 3,\nlines 9, 12, 13b, 13g, and 13h; and\nForms 8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III\nthrough IX only), 8885, and 8919. Also\nsubtract from line 24 any:\n\u2022 Tax on an excess parachute payment,\n\u2022 Excise tax on insider stock compensation of an expatriated corporation,\n\u2022 Uncollected social security and\nMedicare or RRTA tax on tips or\ngroup-term life insurance, and\n\u2022 Look-back interest due under section 167(g) or 460(b). When figuring the amount on line 24,\ninclude household employment taxes\nonly if line 25d is more than zero or you\nwould have owed the estimated tax penalty for 2021 even if you didn't include\nthose taxes. If the Exception just described\ndoesn't apply, see the Instructions for\nForm 2210 for other situations in which\nyou may be able to lower your penalty\nby filing Form 2210. Figuring the Penalty If you choose to figure the penalty yourself, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farmers and fishermen). Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the\npenalty to any tax due and enter the total\non line 37. However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37. Don\u2019t file Form 2210 with your return unless Form 2210 indicates that you\nmust do so. Instead, keep it for your records. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. -60- Because Form 2210 is compli- TIP cated, you can leave line 38\nblank and the IRS will figure\nthe penalty and send you a bill. We\nwon't charge you interest on the penalty\nif you pay by the date specified on the\nbill. If your income varied during the\nyear, the annualized income installment\nmethod may reduce the amount of your\npenalty. But you must file Form 2210\nbecause the IRS can't figure your penalty under this method. Third Party Designee",

Given there is\nnothing that keeps the statute open for a \u201crefund\u201d if the sale price is overestimated,31 the\nappropriate computation is to \u201clook back\u201d at the end of each year to compute the\ninterest Corp F must pay.
