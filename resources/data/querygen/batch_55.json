    "text": "Section 421 specifically disallows a deduction under \u00a7 162 for compensation attributable\nto a stock option granted under \u00a7\u00a7 422 or 423 (except in cases of disqualifying\ndispositions). Given its legislative history, \u00a7 421 also does not permit statutory stock\noptions to be deducted under \u00a7 174. In this section of the memo, we first provide an overview of the tax treatment of stock\noptions. We then explain \u00a7 421\u2019s legislative history and the sole circumstances when\n\u00a7 421 permits a deduction for a statutory stock option. Finally, we discuss and reject\ntaxpayer\u2019s argument that \u00a7 421 does not bar an employer from claiming a \u00a7 174\ndeduction for the Spread of a statutory stock option. 1. Overview of Tax Treatment on Stock Options Generally, employers may deduct compensation attributable to stock options pursuant\nto \u00a7 162(a)(1), which permits a deduction for \u201creasonable allowance for salaries or other\ncompensation.\u201d Employers compensate employees with two types of stock options: (1)\nnonstatutory stock options and (2) statutory stock options. POSTU-153378-08 6 Section 83 sets out the tax treatment for nonstatutory stock options. If the nonstatutory\nstock option has a readily ascertainable fair market value when it is granted, the\nrecipient receiving the option realizes income at that time. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.83-7(a). The\nrecognized income is the fair market value less the amount paid for the option. If the\nnonstatutory stock option does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value when\nit is granted, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.83-7(a) provides that the recipient receiving the option\nrecognizes income when the recipient exercises the nonstatutory stock option. The\nrecognized income equals the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise less\nthe exercise price. We refer to this amount as the compensatory element of the stock\noption. Section 83(h) provides that an employer may deduct the compensatory element\nof the stock option under \u00a7 162. The congressional policy underlying \u00a7 83(h) is that an\nemployer may deduct the compensatory element only if the compensatory element is\nincluded in the gross income of the recipient. See Tilford v. Commissioner, 705 F.2d\n828, 830-31 (6th Cir. 1983); Venture Funding, Ltd. v. Commissioner, 110 T.C. 236, 242\n(1998), aff\u2019d without opinion, 198 F. 3d 248 (6th Cir. 1999). Section 421 sets out the tax treatment for statutory stock options. Statutory stock\noptions include incentive stock options (\u201cISOs\u201d) and options granted under employee\nstock purchase plans (\u201cESPPs\u201d). Section 422 sets out the requirements for ISOs. Section 423 sets out the requirements for ESPPs and for options granted under such\nplans. Section 421(a)(1) provides that \u201cno income shall result at the time of the transfer\nof such share to the individual upon his exercise of the option with respect to such\nshare.\u201d Section 421(a)(2) provides that,\nno deduction under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) shall be\nallowable at any time to the employer corporation, parent or subsidiary\ncorporation of such corporation, or a corporation issuing or assuming a stock\noption in a transaction to which section 424(a) applies, with respect to the share\nso transferred. Accordingly, \u00a7 421(a) provides different tax treatment than \u00a7 83(a).",

    "text": "1. Child tax credit and credit for other dependents (line 19)\nand additional child tax credit (line 28). 2. Head of household filing status. 3. Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule\n3, line 2). 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part\nIII). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number. You must enter each dependent's social security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered\nagree with the dependent's social security card.",
