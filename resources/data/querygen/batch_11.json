Rulon White Blvd\nOgden, UT 84404\nAttn: Frivolous Return Program, MS 4390 from: subject: Mark H. Howard\nSenior Counsel (Salt Lake City)\n(Small Business/Self-Employed) Erroneous refund of withheld social security tax We received a request from the Frivolous Return Program (FRP) at the Ogden\nCampus for advice involving returns filed as part of a scheme in which taxpayers file\nreturns reporting no income but claiming refunds based on income tax withholding and\nFederal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax withholding. We previously provided\nyou with a response on other questions. This memorandum addresses false claims for\nrefund, which include the Old Age and Survivor Disability (OASDI) portion of withheld\nFICA tax (i.e., withheld social security tax). ISSUE When a return falsely reports and claims a credit for withheld social security tax\nand the Service makes an erroneous refund based on that request, can the Service\nrecover these amounts using the assessment procedures provided in I.R.C.\n\u00a7 6201(a)(3)? CONCLUSION The Service may assess the amount of the withheld social security tax that was\nerroneously refunded pursuant to the procedures provided in I.R.C. \u00a7 6201(a)(3). SCAF-109502-06 2 FACTS For our opinion in this matter, we have relied on the facts set out below. If you\nbelieve we have misstated the facts or omitted key facts, please let us know as this\ncould affect our opinion in this matter. Division Counsel SBSE and the IRS FRP based in Ogden, Utah, asked us to\nprovide assistance in the issuance of notices of deficiency asserting fraud against\nparties who have filed frivolous returns using the pattern promoted by Peter Eric\nHendrickson in his book, \u201cCracking the Code.\u201d Persons who follow this pattern report\nnone of their wages as income. They attach to their Form 1040 return a Form 4852,\nsubstitute for Form W-2, in which they report wages of $0 but report the full amount of\nwithholding for income tax, social security, Medicare and state income tax withholding. Most returns following this scheme claim an income tax withholding credit for the\ncombined amount of the income tax withholding, social security withholding and\nMedicare withholding. Some of the persons filing returns following this scheme claim a\ncredit for excess social security payments on line 64 of the Form 1040 even though the\ntaxpayers have not had withholding of social security taxes on income which exceeds\nthe annual wage base amount for the given year. In either case, if the Service does not\nrecognize the return as a frivolous return, it may process the return and issue the\nrefund. The Service has asked us to determine how to recover an erroneous refund\namount based on a false claim for withheld social security tax. LAW AND ANALYSIS\nThe Internal Revenue Code (IRC) imposes FICA tax on every employer equal to\na percentage of wages paid by the employer with respect to employment. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n3111. The Internal Revenue Code imposes a corresponding FICA tax on every\nemployee equal to a percentage of wages with respect to employment. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3101. The FICA tax consists of two components, an OASDI portion and a Medicare portion.",

    "text": "The\nstate generally assessed a tax based on a percentage of racing wagers. Permit holders\nmaking certified capital improvements to their racing facilities could reduce their tax\n0408-023, effective May 23, 2008), but it does not address refundable credits. PREF-128548-08 4 payments by 0.5% of the total amount wagered, continuing for six years or until the total\nreduction reached 70% of the cost of the certified improvements. Northfield Park\nAssociates (\u201cNPA\u201d), an Ohio partnership that operated a racing track, completed\nqualifying capital improvements, entitling it to a tax reduction. The Service initially\nargued, and the Tax Court agreed, that the tax reduction was includible in income in the\ntaxable year in which the state racing commission certified NPA\u2019s capital improvement\ncosts. However, before the Snyder case reached the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the\nService conceded the income issue and agreed with the taxpayer that the proper\ntreatment of the tax reduction was \u201csimply to reduce the deductions available to [the\npartnership] for its pari-mutuel tax obligations, which reduced deductions accrue as\nthose taxes become due.\u201d 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 1603, *10 (alteration in original). The\nSixth Circuit agreed with this analysis. Id. As stated by the court, \u201cThe case at bar does\nnot involve any right on the part of Northfield Park Associates to receive an amount of\nmoney from the State of Ohio; it simply involves a right to start paying the state less in\ntaxes than would have to be paid in the absence of the right.\u201d Id. The Snyder analysis applies to Sub1\u2019s nonrefundable MEGA Business Activity\nCredit because Sub1 never has a right to receive any amount of money from the State\nof Michigan. 2 Accordingly, the Business Activity Credit is a reduction in the taxpayer's\ntax liability, not an item of gross income. However, the MEGA Employment Credit\npresents a somewhat different situation because it is a refundable credit. Case law has not addressed the federal tax treatment of refundable state tax\ncredits, and the Service and the Treasury Department have not issued published\nguidance addressing the treatment of such credits. However, some informal\nnonprecedential advisories issued by the Office of Chief Counsel have applied an\napproach whereby a refundable credit is \"bifurcated.\" That is, refundability, by itself,\ndoes not cause the entire credit to be treated as a payment from the state. Instead, the\nportion of the credit that is applied to reduce tax before the tax becomes due is still\ngenerally treated as a reduction in tax, consistent with Snyder; only to the extent the\ncredit exceeds the tax liability and is made available to the taxpayer as a cash payment\nis it treated as a payment from the state, includable in income unless some exclusion\napplies. Because such a payment is not actually a refund of prior taxes paid, it is not\ntreated as a tax refund potentially excludable from income under \u00a7 111.3\n2 Watervliet Paper Co. v. Commissioner, 16 B.T.A. 604 (1929), is distinguishable. In that case, a\nMichigan taxpayer provided direct services (installation and maintenance of a water system) to the city of\nWatervliet in exchange for relief from taxes.",
