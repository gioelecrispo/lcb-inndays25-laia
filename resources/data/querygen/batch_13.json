    "text": "\u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a qualiTIP fying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the\nEIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying\nchild. For more information, see Pub. 596. Example. Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the\nfive tax benefits listed here based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s AGI is higher than yours and you don\u2019t claim J as a qualifying child, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 596. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. Social security number (SSN). For the EIC, a valid SSN is a\nnumber issued by the Social Security Administration unless\n\u201cNot Valid for Employment\u201d is printed on the social security\ncard and the number was issued solely to allow the recipient of\nthe SSN to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit. However, if \u201cValid for Work Only With DHS Authorization\u201d is printed on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC purposes only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid. To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number\n(SSN) near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't\nhave an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You\nCan't File on Time? If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of\nyour 2022 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC\non your original or an amended 2022 return. If a child didn't\nhave an SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (including extensions), you can't count that child as a qualifying\nchild in figuring the amount of the EIC on your original or an\namended 2022 return. Student. A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar\nmonths of 2022 was enrolled as a full-time student at a school\nor took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school or\na state, county, or local government agency. A school includes a\ntechnical, trade, or mechanical school. It doesn't include an\non-the-job training course, correspondence school, or school offering courses only through the Internet.

    "text": "Likewise, disbursements over receipts do not constitute a\nloss. Thus, A asserts that it is not required to include proceeds from gift check transactions in\nincome for both tax and book purposes. It would help to clarify whether the taxpayer\ndeducts proceeds from gift checks that are spent on services. 5 5 If relying on Seven-Up v. Commissioner, 14 T.C. 965 (1950), acq. 1950-2 C.B. 4, withdrawn and acq. 1974-2 C.B. 4, the taxpayer does not include gift checks proceeds in income, taxpayer should also not\ntake a deduction for gift check proceeds spent on services. Ascertaining that the taxpayer does not do\nboth (fail to recognize gift check income yet take a services expense deduction for gift check proceeds\nspent in services) may also be relevant to whether the taxpayer\u2019s treatment of gift check proceeds\nreflects a method of accounting. The fact that the taxpayer\u2019s exclusion of gift check proceeds from income\nis a permanent exclusion suggests that this is not a method of accounting. However, an argument can be\nmade to the contrary. Therefore, if during your examination of the gift check issue in future cycles, you\ndeem it appropriate or necessary to make adjustments for closed years, it will be necessary to address\nthis complex issue. If this is the case, you will need to request further advice to addresses the question of\nwhether the taxpayer\u2019s exclusion of gift check proceeds from income is a method of accounting. Any POSTF-149051-10 13 Because its bylaws require that all \u201cother income shall be received by A in trust\nand shall be disbursed and expended solely for the non-for-profit purposes,\u201d i.e., for\nservices program purposes, A argues that gift check proceeds cannot be taxed because\nthey are required to be used for services. However, A does not distinguish between\namounts received from gift checks that are never redeemed, which may be used for\nservices, and amounts that are paid to the redeeming D stores, which are obviously not\nused for services. 6 Citing the --------------------Program and Section 3 of the [Services] Agreement\nbetween A and D stores, A maintains that an amount received by a taxpayer is not an\naccession to wealth that must be included in gross income if the taxpayer never\nexercises dominion or control over the amount. A argues that gross income does not\ninclude amounts that a taxpayer receives acting in a fiduciary capacity or as a conduit\nfor payment to another. A asserts that it does not handle the gift check program for its\nown benefit. Given A\u2019s position that it acts as an intermediary that only handles the\nadministration of the gift checks, any activity related to the gift checks is recorded\ndirectly on the balance sheet [Cash (segregated on the trial balance by allotment) and\nUnredeemed Gift Certificates accounts]. However, A\u2019s direct sales of gift checks to online purchasers and scrip\norganizations are sales, and not deposits, in which the purchaser receives the right to\nreceive goods and services.",

Taxpayer calculated gain as follows: Tangibles FMV Received\nAmount 3 FMV Transferred Surplus\nAmount 4\nAmount 5 Tax Basis\nAmount 6 Realized Gain\nAmount 7 Recognized Gain\nAmount 2 4\nSection 1.1031(a)-1(b) defines the words \u201clike kind\u201d as having reference to the nature or\ncharacter of the property and not to its grade or quality. Further, the regulations provide\nthat one kind or class of property may not, under the nonrecognition provisions of\n\u00a7 1031(a), be exchanged for property of a different kind or class. Thus, the fact that any\nreal estate involved is improved or unimproved is not material, for that fact relates only\nto the grade or quality of the property and not to its kind or class. In determining the proper classification of property as real or personal for purposes of\n\u00a7 1031 and the like-kind exchange rules, it is well settled that state law must be\nconsidered. For example, in Rev. Rul. 55-749, 1955-2 C.B. 295, the Service held that\nwhere, under applicable state law, water rights are considered real property rights, the\nexchange of perpetual water rights for a fee interest in land constitutes a non-taxable\nexchange of like-kind property under \u00a7 1031(a). Similarly, in Oregon Lumber v. Commissioner, 20 T.C. 192 (1953), a taxpayer\nexchanged a fee simple interest in real property for a limited right to cut and remove\nstanding timber. The court found that the cutting rights were personal property under\nOregon law and held that \"[a]n exchange of realty for personalty is not an exchange of\nproperty for property of like kind.\" 20 T.C. at 196. See also Morgan v. Commissioner,\n309 U.S. 78, 82 (1940), providing that \"[i]n the application of a federal revenue act, state\nlaw controls in determining the nature of the legal interest which the taxpayers had in\nthe property or income sought to be reached by the statute.\" Once it is determined that property is personal property, the rules in \u00a7 1.1031(a)-2 must\nbe used to determine if the \u201clike-kind\u201d requirements of \u00a7 1031 have been satisfied. Under \u00a7 1.1031(a)-2(b)(1), if depreciable tangible personal property is exchanged for\nother property, the properties are of like-kind within the meaning of \u00a7 1031 if they are\neither of a like kind or a like class. For this purpose, depreciable tangible personal\nproperty is of a like class to other depreciable tangible personal property if the\nexchanged properties are either within the same General Asset Class or within the\nsame Product Class. A single property may not be classified within more than one\nGeneral Asset Class or within more than one Product Class. In addition, property\nclassified within any General Asset Class may not be classified within a Product Class. A property\u2019s class is determined as of the date of the exchange. Section 1.1031(a)-2(b)(2) sets forth the rules relating to General Asset Classes. The\nrules relating to whether exchanged properties are within the same Product Class are in\n\u00a7 1.1031(a)-2(b)(3). Thus, in the present case, the examination team correctly looked to State 1 law in\ndetermining the proper classification of the County 1 and County 2 pipelines as either\nreal or personal for purposes of \u00a7 1031.",

    "text": "Publication 536, on page 7, provides that a taxpayer\u2019s NOL deduction in the\ncarryback/carryover year is equal to the total NOL if the taxpayer has not carried the\nNOL to an earlier year. If the NOL has been carried to an earlier year, the taxpayer\u2019s\nNOL deduction is the total NOL minus the amount of the NOL used (or absorbed) in\nearlier years. Thus, contrary to IRM Section 21.5.9.5.9, Publication 536 provides that\nthe NOL deduction is equal to the total available NOL, not modified taxable income, in\nthe carryover/carryback year. Form 1045, Application for Tentative Refund, and Instructions (2003)\nThe 2003 Form 1045 instructions are consistent with Publication 536. The Form 1045\ninstructions provide as follows: You generally must carry back the entire NOL to the 2nd tax year\nbefore the loss year. Any loss not used in the 2nd preceding year\nis then carried to the 1st preceding year. Any loss not applied in\nthe 2 preceding years may be carried forward up to 20 years. Conflicts arising between the IRM, Publication 536, and Form 1045 Instructions\nAccording to the Service Center, taxpayers seeking a refund for an overpayment\ngenerally offset their adjusted gross income by the entire available NOL, rather than the\nmodified taxable income amount, in recomputing their tax liability for the carryback year. As a result, the after-carryback figures as computed by the Service do not match the 3\ntaxpayer\u2019s after-carryback figures, thereby necessitating an update of each taxpayer\u2019s\nmodule. While, in years in which the NOL is not fully absorbed, regular taxable income\nwill generally be zero whether a taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income is reduced by the\nentire NOL or the modified taxable income amount, the differing treatment of the NOLs\nmay affect other items such as the taxpayer\u2019s alternative minimum tax and earned\nincome credit computation.\n. Issue If a NOL is incurred and carried back to a year in which the NOL is not fully absorbed,\nshould adjusted gross income be reduced by the entire NOL as set forth in Publication\n536 or by modified taxable income as discussed at IRM 21.5.9.5.9? Conclusion\nExcept as provided in Part 2 (relating to the carryback of a single individual\u2019s NOL to a\njoint return year), a taxpayer is required to carryback the entire NOL to the earliest\navailable carryback year. Thus, in the carryback year, adjusted gross income should be\nreduced by the entire NOL, not the modified taxable income amount. Requiring a\ntaxpayer to reduce adjusted gross income by only the modified taxable income amount\nmay result in, for example, an overreporting by the taxpayer of alternative minimum\ntaxable income and an underreporting of the taxpayer\u2019s earned income credit. Legal Analysis\nSection 172(a) allows a deduction equal to the aggregate of the net operating loss\ncarryovers to a taxable year plus the net operating loss carrybacks to such year. Section172(c) defines a \u201cnet operating loss\u201d as the excess of the deductions allowed by\nChapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code over gross income. The excess, however, is\ncomputed with the modifications specified in \u00a7 172(d).",

How Long Should\nRecords Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items\nappearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and\n1099) until the statute of limitations runs\nout for that return. Usually, this is 3\nyears from the date the return was due or\nfiled or 2 years from the date the tax was\npaid, whichever is later. You should\nkeep some records longer. For example,\nkeep property records (including those\non your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or\nreplacement property. For more details,\nsee chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return\nFile Form 1040-X to change a return\nyou already filed. Generally, Form\n1040-X must be filed within 3 years af- ter the date the original return was filed\nor within 2 years after the date the tax\nwas paid, whichever is later. But you\nmay have more time to file Form\n1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically\nor mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. Use the Where's My Amended Return\napplication on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return. It can take\nup to 3 weeks from the date you mailed\nit to show up in our system. Need a Copy of Your\nTax Return Information? Tax return transcripts are free and are\ngenerally used to validate income and\ntax filing status for mortgage applications, student and small business loan\napplications, and during tax return preparation. To get a free transcript:\n\u2022 Visit IRS.gov/Transcript,\n\u2022 Use Form 4506-T or 4506T-EZ, or\n\u2022 Call us at 800-908-9946. If you need a copy of your actual tax\nreturn, use Form 4506. There is a fee for\neach return requested. See Form 4506\nfor the current fee. If your main home,\nprincipal place of business, or tax records are located in a federally declared\ndisaster area, this fee will be waived. Death of a Taxpayer If a taxpayer died before filing a return\nfor 2022, the taxpayer's spouse or personal representative may have to file and\nsign a return for that taxpayer.
