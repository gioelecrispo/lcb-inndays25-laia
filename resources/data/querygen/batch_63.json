    "text": "It usually takes\nabout 2 weeks to get an SSN once the\nSSA has all the evidence and information it needs. Check that both the name and SSN\non your Forms 1040 or 1040-SR, W-2,\nand 1099 agree with your social security\ncard. If they don\u2019t, certain deductions\nand credits on Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nmay be reduced or disallowed and you\nmay not receive credit for your social\nsecurity earnings. If your Form W-2\nshows an incorrect SSN or name, notify\nyour employer or the form-issuing agent\nas soon as possible to make sure your\nearnings are credited to your social security record. If the name or SSN on\nyour social security card is incorrect,\ncall the SSA. Once you are issued an SSN, use it to\nfile your tax return. Use your SSN to file -14- your tax return even if your SSN does\nnot authorize employment or if you have\nbeen issued an SSN that authorizes employment and you lose your employment authorization. An ITIN will not be\nissued to you once you have been issued\nan SSN. If you received your SSN after\npreviously using an ITIN, stop using\nyour ITIN. Use your SSN instead. IRS Individual Taxpayer\nIdentification Numbers\n(ITINs) for Aliens If you are a nonresident or resident alien\nand you don\u2019t have and aren\u2019t eligible to\nget an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN. If you already have an ITIN, enter it\nwherever your SSN is requested on your\ntax return. Some ITINs must be renewed. If you\nhaven't used your ITIN on a federal tax\nreturn at least once for tax years 2019,\n2020, or 2021, it expired at the end of\n2022 and must be renewed if you need\nto file a federal tax return in 2023. You\ndon't need to renew your ITIN if you\ndon't need to file a federal tax return. You can find more information at\nIRS. gov/ITIN. ITINs assigned before 2013\nTIP have expired and must be renewed if you need to file a tax\nreturn in 2023. If you previously submitted a renewal application and it was approved, you do not need to renew again\nunless you haven't used your ITIN on a\nfederal tax return at least once for tax\nyears 2019, 2020, or 2021. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't\nentitle you to social security benefits or\nchange your employment or immigration status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, including application, expiration, and renewal, see Form W-7 and its instructions. If you receive an SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS\noffice or write a letter to the IRS explaining that you now have an SSN and\nwant all your tax records combined under your SSN. Details about what to include with the letter and where to mail it\nare at IRS. gov/ITIN. Nonresident Alien Spouse If your spouse is a nonresident alien,\nyour spouse must have either an SSN or\nan ITIN if:\n\u2022 You file a joint return, or\n\u2022 Your spouse is filing a separate return.

See Schlude v. Commissioner, 372 U.S. 128 (1963);\nAmerican Automobile Assn. v. United States, 367 U.S. 687 (1981); Automobile Club of\nMichigan v. Commissioner, 353 U.S 180 (1957); and Hagen Advertising Displays, Inc. v.\nCommissioner, 407 F.2d 1105 (6th Cir. 1969). The cited Supreme Court cases dealt\nwith prepaid income for services rather than goods. The cases established the principle\nthat, except for certain limited exceptions, an accrual method taxpayer must include in\nincome amounts received for services even though the income had not yet been\nearned. Citing the trilogy of Supreme Court opinions, Hagen Advertising Displays, Inc.\nv. Commissioner, supra, held that a taxpayer must include in income prepaid amounts\nfor blanket orders for manufactured advertising signs in the year the taxpayer received\npayment. In the instant case, direct sales by A to the public or other third parties are\ncompleted sales of gift checks when A transfers the gift checks to the public or other\nthird party. Thus, A must include amounts from the sale of the gift checks in income\nupon the earlier of when A transfers the gift checks or when A receives payment,\nwhichever is first. Treas. Reg. \u00a71.451-1(a). Indirect sales of gift cards through D stores are initially nontaxable exchanges of\na cash equivalent for cash between A and D stores because the gift checks are\nnegotiable instruments that are payable to the order of any franchisor or franchisee\nrestaurant. 9 The sale of the gift checks occurs when D stores sell the gift checks to a\ncustomer or other third-party. Thus, for indirect sales, A must include amounts from the\n9 We emphasize, however, that an argument for immediate taxability could be made based on whether\nthe parties to the transaction, the A and the franchisees, understand the transaction to be a completed\nsale of gift checks between the parties, rather than deposits. In the instant case, the known facts, i.e., the\nfreely negotiable nature of the gift checks, in this particular gift check program, support the conclusions\nreached in this opinion. POSTF-149051-10 17 sale of the gift checks in income when D stores sell the gift checks to a customer or\nother third-party. That is when A becomes entitled to the funds, and when any prepaid\nfunds held by A are no longer held in trust or as deposits and therefore are income to A,\nas discussed above. Treas. Reg. \u00a71.451-1(a).",

    "text": "--------------------------------- assets is greater than or equal to their book\nvalue. Report at 12. LAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 901 allows a credit for foreign income, war profits, and excess profits\ntaxes paid or deemed paid by qualifying taxpayers that elect the foreign tax credit in lieu\nof a deduction under section 164(a)(3). Section 904(a) limits a taxpayer's foreign tax\ncredit to an amount equal to the pre-credit U.S. tax on the taxpayer's foreign source\ntaxable income. Sections 861(b), 862(b), and 863(a) provide that taxable income attributable to\ngross income from domestic or foreign sources shall be determined by deducting the\nexpenses, losses, and other deductions properly apportioned or allocated thereto, and a\nratable part of any expenses, losses and other deductions that cannot be definitely\nallocated to some item or class of gross income. Treas. Reg. '' 1.861-8 through 1.86117 provide specific guidance regarding the allocation and apportionment of deductions. POSFTF-123604-02 5 Generally, deductions are allocated to classes of gross income and, as required by the\noperative section of the Code, apportioned between statutory and residual groupings of\ngross income. The allocation and apportionment regulations emphasize the factual relationship\nbetween deductions and gross income. A deduction is considered to be definitely\nrelated to a class of gross income, and therefore allocable to such class, if the\ndeduction is incurred as a result of, or incident to, an activity or in connection with\nproperty from which such class of gross income is derived. If a deduction is not\ndefinitely related to a class of gross income constituting less than all gross income, it is\ngenerally treated as allocable to all gross income. In the case of interest expense, as is most relevant here, the regulations apply\nthe factual relationship principle in a manner that emphasizes the fungibility of money. As Treas. Reg. ' 1.861-9T(a) explains: The method of allocation and apportionment for interest set forth in this\nsection is based on the approach that, in general, money is fungible and\nthat interest expense is attributable to all activities and property regardless\nof any specific purpose for incurring an obligation on which interest is paid. Exceptions to the fungibility rule are set forth in ' 1.861-10T. The\nfungibility approach recognizes that all activities and property require\nfunds and that management has a great deal of flexibility as to the source\nand use of funds. When money is borrowed for a specific purpose, such\nborrowing will generally free other funds for other purposes, and it is\nreasonable under this approach to attribute part of the cost of borrowing to\nsuch other purposes. Consistent with the principles of fungibility, except\nas otherwise provided, the aggregate of deductions for interest in all cases\nshall be considered related to all income producing activities and assets of\nthe taxpayer and, thus, allocable to all the gross income which the assets\nof the taxpayer generate, have generated, or could reasonably have been\nexpected to generate. Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, all allocations and apportionments of interest\nexpense have been required to be made on the basis of assets rather than gross\nincome. See section 864(e)(2).",

The first option\nrequired that the purchaser handle all aspects of the phone's\nmaintenance and earnings. Two other options transferred some of\nthe phone's responsibility to\n. Ninety percent of the\npurchasers chose Option Four. Under Option Four, the purchaser of the payphone entered\ninto, in essence, a sale and leaseback agreement with\n. then assumed total responsibility for collecting the coins\nfrom the phone, cleaning and maintaining the phone, accounting\nfor the profits, paying the expenses of the phone, such as the\ntelephone service provider, and issuing a check for the net\nprofits to the owner. Although the owner was supposed to receive\npercent of the net profits monthly,\nwas, in fact, paying\n1\na month regardless of the\nall investors a base amount of $\nphone's location.

Commissioner, 258 F.2d 865 (3d Cir.\n1958), rev'g 28 T.C. 962 (1957), the Third Circuit held that no constructive dividend\nresulted to the continuing shareholders when their corporation redeemed the shares of\nanother shareholder. The later case of Holsey clarified that even where the continuing\nshareholders possess an option to purchase, rather than an obligation to do so, no\ndividend results. The Service announced its acquiescence to the Holsey case in Rev. Rul. 58-614,\n1958-2 C.B. 920. \"In the future, the Service will not treat the purchase by a corporation\nof one shareholder's stock as a dividend to the remaining shareholders merely because\ntheir percentage interests in the corporation are increased.\" Underlying these cases and ruling is a recognition that there has been a\ndiminution in corporate earnings and profits, or that debt has been incurred to finance\nthe redemption. Hence, while the proportional ownership interests of the continuing\nshareholders have increased, \"[t]he proportion of the corpor-ation's assets owned by\neach of the shareholders was just the same as it was before. Neither was richer;\nneither was poorer.\" Schmitt at 820-821; Holsey at 868-869; Williams v. Commissioner,\nT.C. Memo. 1976-368, 35 T.C.M. 1672, 1677. As the Williams court succinctly\ndescribed the relevant effects of a redemption, \"[T]he assets of the corporation are at\nthe same time reduced; there-fore, the value of the continuing shareholder's interest in\nthe corporation is not increased.\" Id. The authorities previously noted have hinted that even when share value has\nappreciated in the redemption, such appreciation is not a taxable event to the\ncontinuing shareholders. In the Holsey case, the redemption was for less than book\nvalue of the stock redeemed. By such discount, the continuing shareholders benefitted\nbecause their stock value consequently increased.",
