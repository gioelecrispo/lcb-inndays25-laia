    "text": "POSTF-123043-08 10 means by which that result is accomplished. It is not necessary that the employer\nactually direct or control the manner in which the services are performed; It is sufficient\nif he has the right to do so. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 31.3121(d)-1(c)(2). This determination is\nbased on the facts and circumstances. In determining whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor under\nthe common law, all evidence of control, and lack of control or autonomy must be\nconsidered. In doing so, one must examine the relationship of the worker and the\nbusiness. Relevant facts generally fall into three categories: (1) behavioral controls, (2)\nfinancial controls, and (3) the relationship of the parties. Behavioral controls are evidenced by facts which illustrate whether the service recipient\nhas a right to direct or control how the worker performs the specific tasks for which he or\nshe is hired. Facts which illustrate whether there is a right to control how a worker\nperforms a task include the provision of training or instruction. Financial controls are evidenced by facts which illustrate whether the service recipient\nhas a right to direct or control the financial aspects of the worker's activities. These\ninclude significant investment, unreimbursed expenses, making services available to the\nrelevant market, the method of payment, and the opportunity for profit or loss. The relationship of the parties is generally evidenced by examining the parties'\nagreements and actions with respect to each other, paying close attention to those facts\nwhich show not only how they perceive their own relationship but also how they\nrepresent their relationship to others. Facts which illustrate how the parties perceive\ntheir relationship include the intent of the parties, as expressed in written contracts; the\nprovision of, or lack of employee benefits; the right of the parties to terminate the\nrelationship; the permanency of the relationship; and whether the services performed\nare part of the service recipient's regular business activities. As is the case in almost all worker classification cases, some facts point to an\nemployment relationship while other facts indicate independent contractor status. The\ndetermination of the worker's status, therefore, rests on the weight given to the factors\nunder the common law, keeping in mind that no one factor is determinative of a worker's\nstatus. The ----------- -------letter from ------------General Counsel argues that the --------------------- district does not have a sufficient level of control over the material details of the\n-------members work.

The facts, as presented, raise serious questions about\nwhether the a synfuel facilities constructed for Corporation at\nthe Facility Location were placed in service before July 1,\n1998. a. The facts are insufficient to show that the\ntaxpayers that owned the facilities as of July 1, 1998, were in\nthe trade or business of producing and selling qualified fuel. b. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2. There appears to be some question as to whether the\ncontract was, in fact, a binding written contract as of January\n1, 1997. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FACTS 1.\nOn or about Execution Date, Corporation entered into\nan agreement with c for the construction of d Facilities. The\nagreements enumerate several types and amounts of equipment for\nthe facilities. The equipment described in the agreement\nrelated to systems that were designed to accomplish the Process. Among other things, the agreement listed e, f, g, and other\nequipment designed for the Process. Additional equipment\nfocused on Subprocess. This plan was described in a Date 1 CC:LM:NR:----Page 8\nreport by a construction/engineering firm, apparently prepared\nfor h. Some time during Timeframe 1, the agreement was assigned to\ni. During Timeframe 2, construction began on a synthetic fuel\nproduction facilities at the Facility Location, near j. This\nsite is owned by k, a subsidiary of l. While Corporation acted\nas the owner of the facilities during construction, at some\npoint, these facilities were transferred to, and owned by\nPartnership A, Partnership B, Partnership C, and Partnership D.\nEach was a State X entity, formed on Date 2. A construction permit was obtained in Month 3. Construction\nbegan at the Facility Location on or about Date 4. Plans called\nfor the construction of a facilities, each projected to cost\napproximately $m. It appears that n of the plants were\nconstructed by i, and the remainder by c. The taxpayers produced several videotapes, labeled with\ndates between Date 5 and Date 6, showing equipment operating at\nthe site. Among the parts of a facility shown to be running\nwere o, p, and q. What was clear was that some of the feedstock\ncoal was run through r. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The videotapes\ndid not show operation of s.

Statement of Operations By Line of Business - Statutory Basis\n2. Non-Underwritten Health Benefit Programs - Benefit Payments 3. Interrogatory The first part of the supplement, showing lines of business, included the\nfollowing:\nIndividual\nGroup Community\nExperience\nCost Plus\nNational\nFEP [Federal Employee Plan]\nASO\nOther\nThe second part of the supplement, regarding \"Non-Underwritten Health Benefit\nPrograms,\" listed the following:\n1. Administrative Services Only Accounts\n2. National Accounts and FEP\n3. Inter-Plan Bank/Reciprocity\n4. Medicare\n5. Medicaid\n6. CHAMPUS\n7. Other Non-Underwritten The \"Definitions\" for the supplement distinguished between \"Underwritten Lines\"\nand \"Nonunderwritten Lines.\" Both \"Underwritten Lines\" and \"Nonunderwritten Lines\"\nhad categories regarding \"administrative service\" arrangements and \"national\naccounts.\" The description for administrative service arrangements for \"Underwritten Lines\"\nwas as follows:\nCost Plus/Administrative Services Only\nExperience rated groups for which premiums are fully determined retrospectively. Typically the plan pays the benefits and bills the account for the cost of benefits\nand normal retention items. The plan issues a Blue Cross & Blue Shield\nidentification card, pays the benefits from its bank account, and uses its\ncontractual payment arrangements with providers in the administration of the\ncontract. Often these accounts select aggregate and individual stop loss\nfeatures for which the cost of coverage is included as part of retention or other POSTU-144536-09 16 separate charge. This coverage is often purchased by accounts maintaining\nemployee health benefit plans they believe qualify for the ERISA preemption. In comparison, administrative service arrangements for \"Nonunderwritten Lines\" were\ndescribed as follows:\nASO: Administrative Services Only. Self-insured groups where the group is at\nrisk. The plan only provides administrative services, the subscriber identification\ncards do not include the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield trade names or\ntrademarks, and the benefits are paid using the group's bank account. Note that at this time, 1994, the Financial Reporting Working Group is distinguishing\nbetween administrative service arrangements that are underwritten, and administrative\nservice arrangements that are not underwritten. The Working Group uses the phrase\n\"ASO\" in describing both types of arrangements, although the full label for the\nunderwritten arrangements is \"Cost Plus/Administrative Service Only.\" In contrast, the\nonly term used for the non-underwritten arrangements is \"ASO.\" The Working Group report also included descriptions for \"National Account\"\narrangements that are underwritten, and arrangements that are not underwritten. Underwritten National Accounts are described as follows:\nNational Accounts: A group that has employees located in two or more plan\nservice areas and meets all of the following criteria: (1) is administered by more\nthan one plan; (2) has a control plan and one or more participating plans; (3)\nuses an inter-plan reporting system; and (4) is periodically settled among plans\nby use of the equalization process. FEP is excluded from this definition. [There\nis a separate description for underwritten FEP. Nonunderwritten FEP is included\nin the description of nonunderwritten National Accounts, below.] For \"Nonunderwritten Lines,\" the description for National Accounts is as follows:\nServiced National Accounts and REP [sic, FEP]: Benefits paid by \"service\" plans\non National Accounts and FEP. Service plans perform all functions associated\nwith National Accounts and FEP except the risk assumption function. The\namount of FEP reported under this account category is immaterial.",

    "text": "3 This amount is a refund of overpaid withholding taxes. 4\nIn ---------------- Rebuttal 1, ---------------states that it filed the amended return on -------------------. The\nundersigned attorney assumes that the date indicated in the IRS\u2019s NOPA is the correct filing date. 5 The IRS\u2019s NOPA states that ---------------conceded the portion of the --------foreign tax credit for the --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, -------, and -------- POSTF-113176-10 4 fact that the ten-year period of limitations to file foreign-tax-credit-related refund claims\nfor those taxable years has expired. --------------, on the other hand, argues that it may\nclaim the foreign tax credit in the --------taxable year when it paid the withholding taxes\nand resolved the dispute with the -----------tax authorities. It also claims that its refund\nclaim was timely because the period of limitations began on the due date of its --------return, which had not expired as of the amended return\u2019s filing date. LAW AND ANALYSIS\nI. In which taxable years may ----------------claim the foreign tax credits? A. ---------------is an accrual-basis taxpayer and may only claim the foreign tax\ncredits in the year the taxes accrued. As a preliminary matter, ---------------failed to specifically address on which\nmethod of accounting it may take a foreign tax credit in any given year. The relevant\nauthority is section 905(a) of the Code, which provides that a taxpayer may claim a\nforeign tax credit in the year in which the foreign taxes accrued. The regulations under\nthis section provide that \u201cthe credit . . . may ordinarily be taken either in the return for\nthe year in which the taxes accrued or in which the taxes were paid,\u201d depending on\nwhether the taxpayer\u2019s accounts and returns use an accrual- or cash-basis method of\naccounting. 6 Here, ---------------is an accrual-basis \u2014 not a cash-basis \u2014 taxpayer. As such, it\nmay only claim foreign tax credits in the year the foreign taxes accrued. 7 Accordingly,\nthe determination of the taxable year in which ---------------may claim the foreign tax\ncredit hinges on the meaning of \u201caccrue\u201d within this section. B. Foreign taxes accrued in --------and -------, the years to which the foreign\ntaxes related, for purposes of the foreign tax credit. To understand the meaning of \u201caccrue\u201d for purposes of the foreign tax credit, we\nmust look to the purpose of the credit itself. The legislative history explains that the\ncredit\u2019s purpose was to avoid double taxation of foreign-source income by crediting\nforeign taxes against U.S. income tax liabilities. 8 Congress recognized that, to avoid\ndouble taxation, the year in which the credit may be taken should match the year when\nthe income is subject to the foreign tax. Indeed, Congress acknowledged that \u201cthe tax\nlaws of most [foreign] countries, like our own, provide for the payment of income taxes\n-----------withholding taxes. For this reason, this memorandum only addresses the --------and --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------taxable years. However, it\nappears that ---------------did not so concede, and the section 6511(d)(3)(A) period of limitations expired on\n---------------------, for the --------taxable year. The section 6511(d)(3)(A) period of limitations will expire on ----------------------and ----------------------for the --------and --------taxable years, respectively. 6\nTreas.

    "text": "But since the statute expressly classifies the deductions which are\nallowable, it is important that the classification be kept clear and not be clouded\nby specious use of its terms. [36 B.T.A. at 186.] In the present case, the Taxpayer has created its own definition of cost-plus,\nwhich requires only that \"the 'cost' must be paid under an arrangement in which the\ninsurance company is a party to the obligation to make a payment.\" Protest, page 13,\nemphasis added. The Taxpayer's watered-down definition eliminates any requirement\nthat the Taxpayer be a party to the contract with the subscriber. According to the\nTaxpayer, it does not need to incur a liability to the subscriber, it only needs to be \"a\nparty to the obligation.\" In the words of the Board of Tax Appeals, Congress did not\nmean to provide the special deduction for any payment that a taxpayer may choose to\nlabel \"cost-plus.\" In order to qualify for the special deduction, a taxpayer must not\nmerely be \"a party to the obligation,\" it must actually be the party that is liable to the\nsubscriber for the payment of the claim. POSTU-144536-09 10 C. May the Taxpayer include BCBS Program X arrangements in the computation\nof its special deduction under section 833(b)? It is not necessary for purposes of this case to determine a precise definition of\n\"cost-plus\" within the meaning of section 833(b), because the Taxpayer's Program X\narrangements do not satisfy the minimal definitional requirement -- the \"cost\" is not a\nliability incurred by the Taxpayer. Under the Program X arrangements that are at issue\nin this case, the only BCBS plan that is a party to the arrangement with the policyholder\nand the subscribers is the \"Home\" plan. The Home plan is the plan that makes the\ndetermination whether a claim is allowable. If the services are provided within the\nterritory of the Home plan, the provider submits the claim to the Home plan and the\nHome plan pays the claim. If the services are provided outside the territory of the Home\nplan, the provider submits the claim to its local plan, which is considered the \"Host\"\nplan. The Host plan collects the data for the claim and submits it to the Home plan, but\nthe Home plan is the entity that determines whether the claim is allowable. The Host\nplan does not make any payment to a provider until the Home plan makes its\ndetermination and advises the Host plan of the result. If a claim is disallowed, the provider would look to the subscriber, who has\nreceived services but has not made any payment. If the subscriber feels the claim was\nwrongly disallowed, the subscriber would look to the Home plan. The Host plan never\n\"incurs\" a liability. It is merely satisfying a liability incurred by the Home plan. Materials submitted by the Taxpayer with respect to its Program Y arrangements\nare consistent with this description. The Taxpayer submitted a copy of a form contract\nbetween the Taxpayer and an employer group. One of the provisions in the contract\ndescribed situations involving \"Providers Outside the State of Taxpayer State.\"",

    "text": "For tax purposes, Taxpayer accrues the entire annual fee for rights to telecast a\nseason\u2019s games in the year the games are played and most of the installments are due,\neven though some installments are not due until the subsequent year. POSTF-118789-08 3 LAW\nSection 461(a) provides that the amount of any deduction or credit must be taken for the\ntaxable year that is the proper taxable year under the method of accounting used by the\ntaxpayer in computing taxable income. Section 1.461-1(a)(2)(i) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that, under an accrual\nmethod of accounting, a liability is incurred, and is generally taken into account for\nfederal income tax purposes, in the taxable year in which (1) all the events have\noccurred that establish the fact of the liability, (2) the amount of the liability can be\ndetermined with reasonable accuracy, and (3) economic performance has occurred with\nrespect to the liability (the \"all events test\"). See also \u00a7 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(A). The first prong of the all events test requires that all the events have occurred that\nestablish the fact of the liability. Therefore, it is fundamental to the all events test that\nalthough expenses may be deductible before they become due and payable, liability\nfirst must be firmly established. United States v. General Dynamics Corp., 481 U.S. 239,\n243-4 (1987). Generally, under \u00a7 1.461-1(a)(2), all the events have occurred that establish the fact of\nthe liability when (1) the event fixing the liability, whether that be the required\nperformance or other event, occurs, or (2) payment therefore is due, whichever\nhappens earliest. Rev. Rul. 80-230, 1980-2 C.B. 169; Rev. Rul. 79- 410, 1979-2 C.B.\n231, amplified by Rev Rul. 2003-90, 2003-2 C.B. 353. The terms of a contract are\nrelevant in determining the events that establish the fact of a taxpayer's liability. See,\ne.g., Decision, Inc. v. Commissioner, 47 T.C. 58 (1966), acq., 1967-2 C.B. 2.\nSection 461(h) and \u00a7 1.461-4 provide that, for purposes of determining whether an\naccrual basis taxpayer can treat the amount of any liability as incurred, the all events\ntest is not treated as met any earlier than the taxable year in which economic\nperformance occurs with respect to the liability. Section 1.461-4(d)(2) provides that if a liability of a taxpayer arises out of the providing\nof services or property to the taxpayer by another person, economic performance\noccurs as the services or property is provided. Section 1.461-4(d)(3) provides that if a liability of a taxpayer arises out of the use of\nproperty by the taxpayer, economic performance occurs ratably over the period of time\nthe taxpayer is entitled to the use of the property. ANALYSIS The all-events test is met, with respect to Taxpayer's liability for an annual fee for rights\nto telecast Sport 1 or Sport 2 games, in the year the games are played and the initial\ninstallment payments are due. The fact that final installment payments may be due in a\nsubsequent year does not prevent accrual in the year the games are played since POSTF-118789-08 4 Taxpayer\u2019s liability is fixed by the earlier of performance or payment being due.

    "text": "Thus, a plain reading of 16\nU.S.C. \u00a7 796(17) and (18) suggests that a facility could be both a qualified small power\nproduction facility and a qualified cogeneration facility. 3 In fact, the FERC has certified\nnumerous facilities that have satisfied the criteria of both definitions. 4\nCONCLUSION The taxpayer uses Fuel, a type of biomass, for fuel in its power facility. Its facility\nproduces less than 80 megawatts of electricity. The taxpayer\u2019s facility is within the\ndefinition of a small power production facility. The taxpayer self-certified in Year 1 and\ntherefore the small power production facility is qualified. Accordingly, the equipment\nused in the taxpayer\u2019s qualified small power production facility is \u201c5-year property\u201d\npursuant to \u00a7 168(e)(3)(B)(vi)(II).
