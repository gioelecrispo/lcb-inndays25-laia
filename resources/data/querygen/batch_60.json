The corporation's common stock was owned equally by FH's heirs, A, B, and C.\nBetween the three (3) shareholders, they owned equal amounts of Class A Common\nshares and a higher number of Class B, non-voting Common. All three shareholders,\nas FH and founder before, worked as officers of the corporation. POSTF-106186-02 4 The shareholders entered a Stock Redemption Agreement on FH's Retirement\nDate, the relevant terms of which detailed that for the best interests of the corporation,\nin the event of the death of a shareholder, the company would purchase the shares\nusing funds from life insurance covering some or all of the shareholders. The\nagreement further described the manner that share value was to be determined and\nhow the purchase would be effected if the insurance proceeds exceeded, or fell below,\nthe value of the shares to be acquired. The agreement was amended on First Amendment Date to add provisions for\nthe acquisition of corporate stock upon the volun-tary retirement or disability of a\nshareholder. With respect to a retirement, both shareholders and corporation agreed to\nthe mandatory sale and purchase of stock. On Second Amendment Date, a second\namendment was executed modifying the method of payment of the purchase price. On Trust Creation Date, the stockholders created the Share-holder's Trust\nwhose stated sole purpose was \"to facilitate the acquisition of shares of a deceased\nshareholder by some or all of the surviving shareholders in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Stockholders' Agreement.\" No contemporaneous Stockholders'\nAgreement was executed at that time however. The trust estate was generally to consist of one or more life insurance policies on\nthe life of one or more of the shareholders. This aspect mirrored the Year 2 Stock\nRedemption Agreement which had indicated use of life insurance to fund the stock\nredemption. The trustee was empowered to cause himself to be named the beneficiary\nunder the policies. Upon maturity, the trustee was to collect the proceeds under the\napplicable policy and disburse same in accordance with the provisions of the\nStockholders' Agreement. According to the trust formation documents, policy premiums were to be paid\nfrom and out of the principal and income of the trust or as otherwise set forth in the trust\ndocument.",

Whether it is necessary to secure extensions of the statute of limitations from S\nCorporation shareholders that are grantor trusts or should extensions be obtained from\nthe individual grantors. 2. Whether such extensions should be secured on Forms 872 or Forms 872-I.\nConclusions 1. Extensions of the statute of limitations should be secured from each of the individual\ngrantors of the grantor trusts that are shareholders in the S Corporation. In addition,\nsince it is possible that these trusts are not wholly-owned and therefore only partly\ngrantor trusts, we recommend that you secure extensions of the statutes of limitations\nfrom each trust.

See,\ne.g., Commissioner v. Schleier, 515 U.S. 323, 328 (1995) (noting that \u201cexclusions from\nincome must be narrowly construed\u201d) (internal citations omitted). Z\u2019s spinoff\u2014X\u2019s incorporation of Z, subsequent transfer of its assets to Z, and\ndistribution of the Z stock to the X shareholders\u2014qualified as a tax-free reorganization\nunder sections 368(a)(1)(D), 355(a)(1), and 351(a) of the Code. But the mere fact that\nthe Z spinoff was tax-free does not, in and of itself, mean that the reimbursement\npayments are excludable from X\u2019s income. X must show that the reimbursements\nshould be considered part of the spinoff transaction. X points to a published, but partially redacted, 2007 IRS Office of Chief Counsel\nlegal advice memorandum6 as support for its position. The 2007 advice is a type of\n\u201cwritten determination,\u201d as defined in section 6110(b)(1)(A), and although not binding\nprecedent, its reasoning may prove instructive. IRC \u00a7 6110(k)(3). Regardless, the\nService and taxpayers alike should exercise caution in relying on the conclusions of\nnon-precedential releases, because they are tailored to a specific set of facts and often\nconsidered in a context different from the taxpayer\u2019s. See, e.g., United States v.\nWisconsin Power & Light Co., 38 F.3d 329, 335 (7th Cir. 1994) (noting that, although\nwritten determinations are not precedent, they may contain \u201cevidence of administrative\npractice,\u201d but cautioning that they should not be used \u201cas authoritative interpretations of\nthe Code\u201d). 6 The legal advice memorandum is available on www.irs.gov and is labeled as release number\n20073301F. POSTF-100602-09 8 X argues that its claim for refund is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in\nArrowsmith v. Commissioner, 344 U.S. 6 (1952). In Arrowsmith, the taxpayers claimed\nthat their payment of a judgment against their liquidated corporation was an ordinary\nloss because, although the corporate liquidation distributions were capital gains, the\njudgment occurred in a later year. Id. at 7. The Commissioner argued that the payment\nwas a capital loss because he viewed the judgment as part of the original liquidation\ntransaction, which was capital in nature. Id. at 7-8. The Court held for the\nCommissioner: \u201cTaxpayers were required to pay the judgment because of liability\nimposed on them as transferees of liquidation distribution assets. And it is plain that\ntheir liability as transferees was not based on any ordinary business transaction of theirs\napart from the liquidation proceedings.\u201d Id. at 8. In arriving at its conclusion, the Court\nnoted that, had the payment been made in the year of liquidation, it simply would have\nreduced the amount of capital gains the taxpayers received. Id. The Court also\nrejected the taxpayers\u2019 argument that capital gain treatment of the payment would\nviolate the \u201cprincipal that each taxable year is a separate unit for tax accounting\npurposes.\u201d Id. We disagree that Arrowsmith applies here. In general, Arrowsmith governs\ncases where a subsequent, unknown or unexpected event occurs, and the proper tax\ntreatment of that event can be determined only after reference to an earlier transaction.",

Your\ntaxes can be affected if your SSN is used\nto file a fraudulent return or to claim a\nrefund or credit. \u2022 The IRS doesn\u2019t initiate contact\nwith taxpayers by email, text messages\n(including shortened links), telephone\ncalls, or social media channels to request\nor verify personal or financial information. This includes requests for personal\nidentification numbers (PINs), pass- words, or similar information for credit\ncards, banks, or other financial accounts. \u2022 Go to IRS. gov/IdentityTheft, the\nIRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for\ninformation on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your SSN\nhas been lost or stolen or you suspect\nyou\u2019re a victim of tax-related identity\ntheft, you can learn what steps you\nshould take. \u2022 Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP\nPIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers assigned to taxpayers to help prevent the\nmisuse of their SSNs on fraudulent federal income tax returns. When you have\nan IP PIN, it prevents someone else\nfrom filing a tax return with your SSN. To learn more, go to IRS. gov/IPPIN.
