    "text": "In contrast to the previous situation, in a closed sales transaction,\nthe b seller has ownership to the proceeds of the b sale to the Coop. There is no\n4 When a member or participating patron receives a per-unit retain, this amount compensates him for a\nportion or all of his b cost of production and delivery to the Coop and part of his profit margin on the\ndelivery of b, if any, depending on the amount of per-unit retain \u201cadvanced\u201d to him. Given the theoretical\nideal of a Coop that returns all the gross b proceeds, except for those capitalized by agreement, to its\nmembers/patrons, whether a payment or distribution is characterized as a cost of goods sold, a per unit\nretain representing the member/patron\u2019s cost of goods sold or their profit margin, is irrelevant to the\nCoop\u2019s computation of taxable income. This is because the Coop obtains a deduction or an exclusion\nfrom income, for all cost of goods sold and per-unit retains. Further, to the extent that a patronage\ndistribution is later effected, with respect to the marketing of b, the Coop also gets a patronage dividend\ndeduction. This is true whether this patronage dividend distribution represents a further return of the\nmember/farmer\u2019s cost of goods produced or profit. See I.R.C. \u00a71382(a) and (b).\n5 Although recognizing that per-unit retains and patronage dividends are each provided for individually in\nthe Internal Revenue Code, the equivalence between the two has been judicially recognized. See Farm\nService Cooperative v. Commissioner, 619 F.2d 718, 725, n. 17 (8th Cir. 1980), 1980-1 U.S.T.C. Par.\n9352, rev\u2019g, 70 T.C. 145 (1978). POSTF-143023-10 17 evidence in the instant case, that the members and participating patrons ever intended\nor that they would be amenable to returning any of the b sale proceeds to the Coop, in\nthe event that the Coop\u2019s b sales to third parties failed to equal or exceed the amount of\nper-unit retains paid in money to the members and participating patrons. Therefore, a\nclosed purchase and a per-unit retain are not identical concepts. They are significantly\ndifferent in material ways. If any question remains that a per-unit retain is a unique concept, not identical,\nand quite different from the concept of gross proceeds from completed b sales, and that\nper-unit retains are only those retained pursuant to mutual agreement, a reading of the\nrelevant part of the Senate Report to the Foreign Investors Act of 1966, that provided\nparallel treatment to per-unit retains and patronage dividends, should dispel any\nconfusion. The report, in relevant part, explains, as follows:\n\u201cAlthough the practices of cooperatives are not uniform \u2026, generally a per-unit\nretain certificate is issued by a cooperative to a patron to reflect the retention by\nthe cooperative of a portion of the proceeds from the marketing of products for\nthe patron. These amounts are retained pursuant to an authorization (usually in\nthe bylaws of the cooperative) and are computed on the basis of units of\nproducts marketed. Prior to the amendments in 1962, the Internal Revenue Code permitted\ncooperatives to deduct amounts paid to patrons as patronage dividends.",

(d) Compliance and suitability checks. (1) As a condition to consideration of an\napplication, the Internal Revenue Service may\nconduct a Federal tax compliance check and\nsuitability check. The tax compliance check will be\nlimited to an inquiry regarding whether an applicant\nhas filed all required individual or business tax\nreturns and whether the applicant has failed to pay, or\nmake proper arrangements with the Internal Revenue\nService for payment of, any Federal tax debts. The suitability check will be limited to an inquiry\nregarding whether an applicant has engaged in any\nconduct that would justify suspension or disbarment\nof any practitioner under the provisions of this part\non the date the application is submitted, including\nwhether the applicant has engaged in disreputable\nconduct as defined in \u00a710.51. The application will\nbe denied only if the results of the compliance or\nsuitability check are sufficient to establish that the\npractitioner engaged in conduct subject to sanctions\nunder \u00a7\u00a710.51 and 10.52. (2) If the applicant does not pass the tax\ncompliance or suitability check, the applicant will\nnot be issued an enrollment or registration card or\ncertificate pursuant to \u00a710.6(b) of this part. An\napplicant who is initially denied enrollment or\nregistration for failure to pass a tax compliance\ncheck may reapply after the initial denial if the\napplicant becomes current with respect to the\napplicant\u2019s tax liabilities. (e) Temporary recognition. On receipt of a properly\nexecuted application, the Commissioner, or delegate,\nmay grant the applicant temporary recognition to\npractice pending a determination as to whether status\nas an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent,\nor registered tax return preparer should be granted. Temporary recognition will be granted only in\nunusual circumstances and it will not be granted, in\nany circumstance, if the application is not regular on\nits face, if the information stated in the application,\nPage 10 \u2014 \u00a7 10.5 if true, is not sufficient to warrant granting the\napplication to practice, or the Commissioner,\nor delegate, has information indicating that the\nstatements in the application are untrue or that the\napplicant would not otherwise qualify to become\nan enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or\nregistered tax return preparer.

(f) Protest of application denial. The applicant\nwill be informed in writing as to the reason(s) for\nany denial of an application. The applicant may,\nwithin 30 days after receipt of the notice of denial of\nthe application, file a written protest of the denial as\nprescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms,\nguidance, or other appropriate guidance.

The business enterprise value of -----was determined to be -----. Assuming total intercompany debt of approximately ----------------------------- of loans outstanding to taxpayer and\nloans from another related controlled foreign corporation), a\n100% interest in the common stock of ---- was also determined to\nhave no positive value as of ------. Claimed Losses\nTaxpayer made an election pursuant to Treas.

The change in entity\nclassification from a corporation to a branch resulted in a\ndeemed liquidation of the corporations for U.S. tax purposes. See Treas. Reg. section 301.7701-3(g)(1). Taxpayer argues that as a result of the deemed liquidations,\nsection 165(g) permits the recognition of worthless stock losses\nin the amounts of ---- and ----, with respect to its stock in ---------and --, respectively. In addition, taxpayer argues that\nsection 166 permits the recognition of bad debt losses of -----------------and -----with respect to loans outstanding to --------and ----, respectively.2 The bad debt and worthless stock losses were claimed only\n2 The bad debt losses were calculated by subtracting from the\noutstanding loans balances the value of the assets of ------------ and --. for U.S. tax purposes and were not reflected for U.S. financial\nreporting purposes.

Debt \u2013 Equity Analysis The audit team engaged in a debt-equity analysis of the\nintercompany loans to -----and --. The audit team reached a\npreliminary determination that a significant portion of the loans\nshould be reclassified as equity. As a result of the\nreclassification, -----and ---would have been solvent at the time\nof the deemed liquidation. Since the entities were solvent,\nproperty would have been received by taxpayer in exchange for its\nstock in the liquidation. Section 332 provides that no gain or\nloss is recognized by a shareholder in the liquidation of a\ncorporation where property is received by the shareholder in\nexchange for its stock. Therefore, section 332 would apply and\ntaxpayer would not be entitled to a worthless stock loss under\nsection 165(g) with respect to its stock in -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------and --.3 The taxpayer has argued that any reclassified debt should be\ntreated as preferred stock since the advances were documented by\nnotes which provided for a stated rate of return on the advances. In a liquidation, property is deemed distributed first to\ncreditors, then to preferred shareholders and then to common\nshareholders. In our case, assuming that the value of the assets\nwould not satisfy taxpayer\u2019s entire investment in the preferred\nstock, no assets would be received on the common shares and\nsection 332 would not apply.

Fully Taxable Pensions and\nAnnuities Your payments are fully taxable if (a)\nyou didn't contribute to the cost (see\nCost, later) of your pension or annuity,\nor (b) you got your entire cost back tax\nfree before 2022. But see Insurance Premiums for Retired Public Safety Officers, later. If your pension or annuity is\nfully taxable, enter the total pension or\nannuity payments (from Form(s)\n1099-R, box 1) on line 5b; don\u2019t make\nan entry on line 5a. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. Fully taxable pensions and annuities\nalso include military retirement pay\nshown on Form 1099-R. For details on\nmilitary disability pensions, see Pub.\n525. If you received a Form\nRRB-1099-R, see Pub. 575 to find out\nhow to report your benefits. Partially Taxable Pensions and\nAnnuities\nEnter the total pension or annuity payments (from Form 1099-R, box 1) on\nline 5a. If your Form 1099-R doesn't\nshow the taxable amount, you must use\nthe General Rule explained in Pub. 939\nto figure the taxable part to enter on\nline 5b. But if your annuity starting date\n(defined later) was after July 1, 1986,\nsee Simplified Method, later, to find out\nif you must use that method to figure the\ntaxable part. You can ask the IRS to figure the taxable part for you for a $1,000 fee. For\ndetails, see Pub. 939. If your Form 1099-R shows a taxable\namount, you can report that amount on\nline 5b. But you may be able to report a\nlower taxable amount by using the General Rule or the Simplified Method or if\nthe exclusion for retired public safety officers, discussed next, applies. Insurance Premiums for Retired\nPublic Safety Officers If you are an eligible retired public safety officer (law enforcement officer, firefighter, chaplain, or member of a rescue\nsquad or ambulance crew), you can elect\nto exclude from income distributions\nmade from your eligible retirement plan\nthat are used to pay the premiums for\ncoverage by an accident or health plan\nor a long-term care insurance contract. You can do this only if you retired because of disability or because you\nreached normal retirement age. The premiums can be for coverage for you, your\nspouse, or dependents. The distribution\nmust be from a plan maintained by the\nemployer from which you retired as a\npublic safety officer. Also, the distribution must be made directly from the plan\nto the provider of the accident or health\nplan or long-term care insurance contract. You can exclude from income the\nsmaller of the amount of the premiums\nor $3,000. You can make this election only for amounts that would otherwise\nbe included in your income.",
