    "text": "Florida v HHS does not address \u00a7 355, per se, and does not address \u00a7 355 as in force for the years at\nissue. Rather, Florida v HHS addressed the 2010 health reform legislation. Specifically Florida v HHS\nholds unconstitutional the requirement that individuals purchase health insurance in the Patient Protection\nand Affordable Care Act (ACA), Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), as amended by section 1404\nof the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA), Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat.\n1029 (2010) (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ACA), with the District Court in Florida v HHS also\nholding the insurance requirement cannot be severed so the entire ACA is unconstitutional. However, the\nEleventh Circuit reversed the District Court\u2019s severability holding and other cases have upheld the\nconstitutionality of the minimum essential coverage requirements, including Mead v. Holder, 766 F. Supp\n2d. 16, 2011 WL 611139 (D.D.C. 2011); Liberty University, Inc. v. Geithner, 753 F.Supp.2d 611, 2010 WL\n4860299 (W.D.Va. 2010); and Thomas More Law Center v.

See Congressional Research Service, Requiring Individuals to Obtain\nHealth Insurance: A Constitutional Analysis, August 26, 2011, at 25-32 (analysis of legal challenges to the\nminimum essential coverage requirement). The provisions of the ACA that impact 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355 are\n\u00a7\u00a7 7002 and 10609, which amended 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355 to add language relative to biologics and labeling,\nrespectively. See Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 stat. 119 at 816-817, 820, 860, and 1014-15 (2010). Neither\namendment impacts the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355 as in force and effect in the years here at\nissue. 47 Non Refundable Upfront Fees, Technology Access Fees, Milestone Payments, Royalties and Deferred\nIncome under a Collaboration Agreement, Tax Notes Today, October 18, 2007, 2007 TNT 204-17.

In the preclinical or discovery research stage (typically the first two\nyears of the discovery/development process), a compound is tested\non animals and non-human systems. If the compound/molecule\nlooks promising at this stage, it is patented. The patent prevents\nother companies from freely using the same compound/molecule\nfor 20 years (life span of a patent). The Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) established a set of standards (called \"Good\nLaboratory Practice\") for this stage of development to ensure\nquality of animal testing and the resultant data for an Investigational\nNew Drug Application (IND). If the IND is approved by the FDA,\ntesting of the compound/molecule in humans can begin. Th[e] second stage is known as clinical development. Clinical\ndevelopment (typically spans 5 to 7 years or years 3 through 10 of\nthe discovery/development process) is normally conducted in three\nphases. In Phase I, the first trials in humans are conducted for\nsafety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics. In Phase II, testing is done\nto evaluate effectiveness, dosage and safety in selected\npopulations of patients with the disease or condition to be treated,\ndiagnosed or prevented.",

POSTS-104573-11 3 LAW AND ANALYSIS\nApplicable Law\nInternal Revenue Code section 472(c) provides that a taxpayer who elects to use the\nLIFO inventory method for federal income tax purposes must establish to the\nsatisfaction of the Secretary that it has used no method other than LIFO in inventorying\nsuch goods to ascertain the income, profit, or loss of the first taxable year for which\nLIFO is to be used, for the purpose of a report or statement covering such taxable year\nto shareholders, partners, or other proprietors, or to beneficiaries, or for credit purposes. Section 472(e)(2) imposes a requirement similar to that contained in section 472(c) for\ntaxable years subsequent to the year of the LIFO election and provides that the\ntaxpayer may be required to discontinue the use of the LIFO inventory method if this\nrequirement is violated. Section 472(g) provides that all members of the same group of financially related\ncorporations shall be treated as one taxpayer for purposes of the LIFO conformity\nrequirements contained in subsections (c) and (e)(2). The term \u201cgroup of financially\nrelated corporations\u201d means any affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a),\ndetermined by substituting \u201c50 percent\u201d for \u201c80 percent\u201d each place it appears and\nwithout regard to section 1504(b), and any other group of corporations that consolidate\nor combine for purposes of financial statements. Treasury Regulation section 1.472-2(e)(1) provides, in part: The taxpayer must establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that\nthe taxpayer, in ascertaining the income, profit, or loss for the taxable year\nfor which the LIFO inventory method is first used, or for any subsequent\ntaxable years, for credit purposes or for purposes of reports to\nshareholders, partners, or other proprietors, or to beneficiaries, has not\nused any inventory method other than that referred to in \u00a7 1.472-1 or at\nvariance with the requirements of \u00a7 1.472-2(c). Section 1.472-2(e)(1)(i) provides that the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cuse of an inventory method other\nthan LIFO for purposes of ascertaining information reported as a supplement to or\nexplanation of the taxpayer\u2019s primary presentation of the taxpayer\u2019s income, profit, or\nloss, for a taxable year in credit statements or financial reports\u201d is not considered at\nvariance with the requirements \u00a7 1.472-2(e)(1). Section 1.472-2(e)(1)(ii) provides that the \u201cuse of an inventory method other than LIFO\nto ascertain the value of the taxpayer\u2019s inventory of goods on hand for purposes of\nreporting the value of such inventories as assets\u201d is not considered at variance with the\nrequirements of \u00a7 1.472-2(e)(1). POSTS-104573-11 4 Section 1.472-2(e)(1)(iii) provides that the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cuse of an inventory method other\nthan LIFO for purposes of ascertaining information reported in internal management\nreports\u201d is not considered at variance with the requirements \u00a7 1.472-2(e)(1).

Counsel for -------elected\nnot to do so. Under former I.R.C. \u00a7 6013(e), the spouse not claiming relief\nlacked standing to challenge the innocent spouse relief granted to\nhis or her spouse in a judicial proceeding. Thus, under the law\nexisting when - and ------filed their petition on -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, it is clear that ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ would have had\nno right to challenge --\u2019s claim for innocent spouse relief.

In Corson v.

Petitioner -----'s attorney, ----, moved to sever ----------from\nthe case as it related to her innocent spouse defense on -------,\nalmost -- months after the enactment of I.R.C. \u00a7 6015. -------------and ------, counsel for ------, were both present in Tax Court\non -----, when the Court granted --'s motion to sever.

Lettie Page Whitehead\nFoundation, Inc. v. United States, 606 F.2d 534, 538 (5th Cir.\n1979). claims that it awarded stock options to its\nsubsidiaries\u2019 employees to induce the expatriate employees to\npromote and protect its global-brand, trademarks, and reputation. claims that this global-brand strategy protected\nand enhanced\nreputation and goodwill, which\nincreased\nroyalty income and the sales of\nto its subsidiaries. claims that\nits interest in protecting its global-brand, trademarks, and\nreputation are at odds with the subsidiaries\u2019 interest in\nmaximizing local profits, and therefore,\nmust\ncompensate the expatriate employees in a manner tied directly to\noverall success, rather than the success of the\nsubsidiary. Therefore,\nclaimed that it awarded\nstock options to encourage the employees to act in\ninterest where that interest might be in conflict with the\nsubsidiary\u2019s short term profit goals. presented\nno evidence to support this claim.

These cases involved a clear proximate danger\nto the taxpayer and involved a payment made to protect the\ntaxpayer\u2019s existing business from imminent harm. Young & Rubicam,\n410 F.2d at 1243.

Therefore,\n\u201cultimate\npurpose\u201d in paying the stock options was to realize a return\nthrough corporate profits received from its subsidiaries, and was\nnot to keep its subsidiaries in existence to protect or promote\nown business by realizing a return on its\npayment of the stock options through continued profits from\nunrelated third parties. The courts do not allow the exception\nto the general rule for this type of motivating purpose. See e.g.\nLohrke, 48 T.C. at 679. Here,\nwas not in imminent\nharm and did not offer any proof that it had a motivating purpose\nto protect and promote its own business prior to incurring the\nexpense of the stock options.

Reg. \u00a71.671-4(a), effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1,\n1996, provides that in general, items of income, deduction, and credit attributable to any\nportion of a trust which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person are not\nreported by the trust on Form 1041, but are shown on a separate statement to be\nattached to that form. Accordingly, since the grantor trust is not a taxable entity,\ngenerally a grantor trust only files a blank return with a statement that shows the items POSTF-103406-08 5 of income, deduction, and credit of the trust of the taxable year that are attributable to\nthe grantor. Per Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.671-4(b)(2)(B), the trustee need not file any type of\nreturn in the case of a trust all of which is owned by one grantor or one other person,\nwhere the trustee furnishes certain information to payors and furnishes to the grantor or\nother person treated as the owner of the trust with a statement that: (1) shows all items\nof income, deduction, and credit of the trust for the taxable year; (2) identifies the payor\nof each item of income; (3) provides information necessary to take the items into\naccount in computing the grantor\u2019s or other person\u2019s taxable year; and (4) informs the\ngrantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust that the items of income,\ndeduction and credit and other information shown on the statement must be included in\ncomputing the taxable income and credits of the grantor or other person on the income\ntax return of the grantor or other person. Litigation of grantor trust issues has occurred in the Tax Court; see Lardas v.\nCommissioner, 99 T.C. 490 (1992). In that case, the Court held that the relevant return\nfor determining when the statute of limitations is triggered is the return of the grantor,\nnot the grantor trust. Thus, the Court held that \u201csection 6501(a) refers to the taxpayer\u2019s\nreturn [in the case, husbands and wives], and not that of the source entity, where such\nsource entity is a grantor trust.\u201d Id., at 499. The Tax Court has consistently maintained\nthis position without regard to the source entity involved; see cases cited in Olson v.\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 1992-711. We have no reason to think that the Tax Court\nwould take a different position in regard to ------------------------------------------------------------------- and to ---------------------- and ------------------------ and their respective spouses, if\nany. Given the addresses of ---------------- and ---------------------, should any litigation of this\nissue occur, any such decision would be appealable to the Court of Appeals, Second\nCircuit.3 That Circuit, in Rothstein v. United States, 735 F.2d 704, 709 (2d Cir. 1984),\nheld that although the grantor must include items of income, deduction, and credit\nattributable to the trust in computing the grantor\u2019s taxable income and credits, the trust\nmust continue to be viewed as a separate taxpayer for purposes of sales transactions. Conceivably, one could conclude from this decision that the pertinent statute of\nlimitations related to the trust, rather than to the grantors.",

    "text": "However, if you were a nonresident alien or a dual-status alien and were\nmarried to a U.S. citizen or resident alien at the end of 2022, you can elect to\nbe treated as a resident alien and file a\njoint return. See Pub. 519 for details. Married Filing Separately\nCheck the \u201cMarried filing separately\u201d\nbox at the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nif you are married, at the end of 2022,\nand file a separate return. Enter your\nspouse\u2019s name in the entry space below\nthe filing status checkboxes. Be sure to\nenter your spouse\u2019s SSN or Individual\nTaxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)\nin the space for spouse\u2019s SSN on Form\n1040 or 1040-SR. If your spouse doesn\u2019t\nhave and isn\u2019t required to have an SSN\nor ITIN, enter \u201cNRA\u201d in the entry space\nbelow the filing status checkboxes. For electronic filing, enter the spouse's name or \u201cNRA\u201d if the spouse\ndoesn\u2019t have an SSN or ITIN in the en- try space below the filing status checkboxes. If you are married and file a separate\nreturn, you generally report only your\nown income, deductions, and credits. Generally, you are responsible only for\nthe tax on your own income. Different\nrules apply to people in community\nproperty states; see Pub. 555. However, you will usually pay more\ntax than if you use another filing status\nfor which you qualify. Also, if you file a\nseparate return, you can't take the student loan interest deduction or the education credits, and you will only be able\nto take the earned income credit and\nchild and dependent care credit in very\nlimited circumstances. You also can't\ntake the standard deduction if your\nspouse itemizes deductions. You may be able to file as head TIP of household if you had a child\nliving with you and you lived\napart from your spouse during the last 6\nmonths of 2022. See Married persons\nwho live apart, later. Head of Household You can check the \u201cHead of household\u201d\nbox at the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nif you are unmarried and provide a home\nfor certain other persons. You are considered unmarried for this purpose if any\nof the following applies. \u2022 You were legally separated according to your state law under a decree of\ndivorce or separate maintenance at the\nend of 2022. But if, at the end of 2022,\nyour divorce wasn't final (an interlocutory decree), you are considered married. \u2022 You are married but lived apart\nfrom your spouse for the last 6 months\nof 2022 and you meet the other rules under Married persons who live apart, later. \u2022 You are married and your spouse\nwas a nonresident alien at any time during the year and the election to treat the\nalien spouse as a resident alien is not\nmade. Check the \u201cHead of household\u201d box only if you are unmarried (or considered\nunmarried) and either Test 1 or Test 2\napplies. Test 1. You paid over half the cost of\nkeeping up a home that was the main\nhome for all of 2022 of your parent whom you can claim as a dependent, except under a multiple support agreement\n(see Who Qualifies as Your Dependent,\nlater). Your parent didn't have to live\nwith you. Test 2.",

If you\nstill need help, IRS TACs provide tax\nhelp when a tax issue can\u2019t be handled\nonline or by phone. All TACs now provide service by appointment, so you\u2019ll\nknow in advance that you can get the\nservice you need without long wait\ntimes. Before you visit, go to IRS. gov/\nTACLocator to find the nearest TAC and\nto check hours, available services, and\nappointment options. Or, on the IRS2Go\napp, under the Stay Connected tab,\nchoose the Contact Us option and click\non \u201cLocal Offices.\u201d Interest and Penalties You don\u2019t have to figure the amount of\nany interest or penalties you may owe. We will send you a bill for any amount\ndue. If you choose to include interest or\npenalties (other than the estimated tax\npenalty) with your payment, identify and\nenter the amount in the bottom margin\nof Form 1040 or 1040-SR, page 2. Don\u2019t\ninclude interest or penalties (other than\nthe estimated tax penalty) in the amount\nyou owe on line 37. For more information on the estimated tax penalty, see\nLine 38, earlier. Interest We will charge you interest on taxes not\npaid by their due date, even if an extension of time to file is granted. We will\nalso charge you interest on penalties imposed for failure to file, negligence,\nfraud, substantial or gross valuation misstatements, substantial understatements\nof tax, and reportable transaction understatements. Interest is charged on the\npenalty from the due date of the return\n(including extensions). Penalties\nLate filing. If you don\u2019t file your return\nby the due date (including extensions),\nthe penalty is usually 5% of the amount\ndue for each month or part of a month\nyour return is late, unless you have a\nreasonable explanation. If you have a\nreasonable explanation for filing late, include it with your return. The penalty\ncan be as much as 25% of the tax due. The penalty is 15% per month, up to a\nmaximum of 75%, if the failure to file is\nfraudulent. If your return is more than\n60 days late, the minimum penalty will\nbe $450 or the amount of any tax you\nowe, whichever is smaller. Late payment of tax. If you pay your\ntaxes late, the penalty is usually 1/2 of\n1% of the unpaid amount for each -81- month or part of a month the tax isn't\npaid. The penalty can be as much as\n25% of the unpaid amount. It applies to\nany unpaid tax on the return. This penalty is in addition to interest charges on\nlate payments. Frivolous return. In addition to any\nother penalties, the law imposes a penalty of $5,000 for filing a frivolous return. A frivolous return is one that doesn't\ncontain information needed to figure the\ncorrect tax or shows a substantially incorrect tax because you take a frivolous\nposition or desire to delay or interfere\nwith the tax laws. This includes altering\nor striking out the preprinted language\nabove the space where you sign.

Requirements for an\nElectronic Return To file your return electronically, you\nmust sign the return electronically using\na personal identification number (PIN)\nand provide the information described\nbelow. If you are filing online using\nsoftware, you must use a Self-Select\nPIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a\nSelf-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. For 2022, if we issued you an identity\nprotection personal identification number (IP PIN) (as described in more detail\nbelow), all six digits of your IP PIN\nmust appear in the IP PIN spaces provi- ded next to the space for your occupation for your electronic signature to be\ncomplete. Failure to include an issued IP\nPIN on the electronic return will result\nin an invalid signature and a rejected return. If you are filing a joint return and\nboth taxpayers were issued an IP PIN,\nenter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN\nmethod allows you to create your own\nPIN. If you are married filing jointly,\nyou and your spouse will each need to\ncreate a PIN and enter these PINs as\nyour electronic signatures. A PIN is any combination of five digits you choose except five zeros. If you\nuse a PIN, there is nothing to sign and\nnothing to mail\u2014not even your Forms\nW-2. Your electronic return is considered a\nvalidly signed return only when it includes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your adjusted gross income (AGI) from your\noriginally filed 2021 federal income tax\nreturn, if applicable. If you're filing\njointly, your electronic return must also\ninclude your spouse's PIN, last name,\ndate of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and\nAGI, if applicable, in order to be considered validly signed. Don\u2019t use your AGI\nfrom an amended return (Form 1040-X)\nor a math error correction made by the\nIRS. AGI is the amount shown on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. If\nyou don\u2019t have your 2021 income tax return, call the IRS at 800-908-9946 to get\na free transcript of your return or visit\nIRS.gov/Transcript. (If you filed electronically last year, you, and your\nspouse if filing jointly, may use your\nprior year PIN to verify your identity instead of your prior year AGI. The prior\nyear PIN is the five-digit PIN you used\nto electronically sign your 2021 return.) You can't use the Self-Select\nPIN method if you are a\nCAUTION first-time filer under age 16 at\nthe end of 2022. ! Practitioner PIN. The Practitioner PIN\nmethod allows you to authorize your tax\npractitioner to enter or generate your\nPIN. Your electronic return is considered a validly signed return only when it\nincludes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, and IP PIN, if applicable. If you're -61- filing jointly, your electronic return must\nalso include your spouse's PIN, last\nname, date of birth, and IP PIN, if applicable in order to be considered validly\nsigned.
