You\ndon't need to renew your ITIN if you\ndon't need to file a federal tax return. You can find more information at\nIRS. gov/ITIN. ITINs assigned before 2013\nTIP have expired and must be renewed if you need to file a tax\nreturn in 2023. If you previously submitted a renewal application and it was approved, you do not need to renew again\nunless you haven't used your ITIN on a\nfederal tax return at least once for tax\nyears 2019, 2020, or 2021. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't\nentitle you to social security benefits or\nchange your employment or immigration status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, including application, expiration, and renewal, see Form W-7 and its instructions. If you receive an SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS\noffice or write a letter to the IRS explaining that you now have an SSN and\nwant all your tax records combined under your SSN. Details about what to include with the letter and where to mail it\nare at IRS. gov/ITIN.

LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with\nthe IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition,\nLITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak\nEnglish as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, see\nthe LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate. IRS.gov/LITCMap or IRS Publication 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic List. This\npublication is available online at IRS. gov/Forms-Pubs or by calling the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). Suggestions for Improving the IRS\nTaxpayer Advocacy Panel\nTaxpayers have an opportunity to provide direct feedback to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) through the Taxpayer Advocacy\nPanel (TAP).

Eligible\nindividuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance\ncompany. If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the\npremium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach\nForm 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year. The Marketplace is required to send Form 1095-A by January 31, 2023, listing the advance payments and other\ninformation you need to complete Form 8962. 1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace. 2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments. 3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR. (Don\u2019t include Form 1095-A.) Health Coverage Reporting If you or someone in your family was an employee in 2022, the employer may be required to send you Form\n1095-C. Part II of Form 1095-C shows whether your employer offered you health insurance coverage and, if\nso, information about the offer. You should receive Form 1095-C by early March 2023. This information may be\nrelevant if you purchased health insurance coverage for 2022 through the Health Insurance Marketplace and\nwish to claim the premium tax credit on Schedule 3, line 9. However, you don\u2019t need to wait to receive this form\nto file your return. You may rely on other information received from your employer.

The Office of the Associate\nChief Counsel (International), provided us with comments on the\nearlier memorandum. As a result of those comments, this\nmemorandum reflects the modifications suggested by the National\nOffice. This memorandum should not be cited as precedent. ISSUES\n1. Whether rental income received by TP-FSC in an\nO-FSC leasing transaction that is recharacterized as interest\nincome from a financing arrangement is income effectively\nconnected with the conduct of a trade or business within the\nUnited States (ECI)? 2. Whether TP-FSC may claim a FTC with respect to such\nrecharacterized interest income? 3. Whether parent/taxpayer may claim a deemed paid FTC with\nrespect to such recharacterized interest income? 4. Whether parent/taxpayer\u2019s FTC limitation will increase as\na result of such recharacterization? CC:LM:FS:LI:POSTF-129710-02 page 2 CONCLUSIONS 1. Rental income received by TP-FSC in an O-FSC leasing\ntransaction recharacterized as interest income from a financing\ntransaction is ECI. 2. TP-FSC may claim a FTC with respect to such\nrecharacterized interest income. 3. Parent/taxpayer may not claim a deemed paid FTC with\nrespect to such recharacterized interest income. 4. The parent/taxpayer\u2019s FTC limitation may increase as a\nresult of this recharacterization of income. FACTS The facts below are taken solely from one of the\nparent/taxpayer\u2019s O-FSC transactions that was the subject of\nprior Field Service Advice. Please note that for purposes of this memorandum, we will\nuse \u201cparent/taxpayer\u201d to include the domestic financial services\ninstitution, its subsidiaries, and various entities that\nparent/taxpayer has acquired, but the term does not include TPFSC or any other FSC. In this transaction, treated as a sale/leaseback by the\nparties, TP-FSC was incorporated in\nas an indirectly\nwholly owned subsidiary of the parent/taxpayer. In addition to\nTP-FSC, parent/taxpayer established a wholly owned domestic\nGrantor Trust (the Trust) which functioned as the vehicle for the\nestablishment, capitalization, and maintenance of TP-FSC. The\nTrust owned 100 percent of TP-FSC\u2019s outstanding stock. Per the\ntransaction as created by the participants, a second domestic\nGrantor Trust (Trustee) was the borrower of the nonrecourse loan\nfrom the Foreign Lender; the Trustee was authorized by the\nparent/taxpayer to act as Trustee for the first Trust and to hold\nthe capital stock of TP-FSC. The Trustee transferred funds from\nthe parent/taxpayer via the Trust (the equity investment) and the\ntotal proceeds of the nonrecourse loan to TP-FSC. As required by the Loan Agreement, TP-FSC used the\nnonrecourse loan proceeds and the equity investment to allegedly\npurchase the\nsubject to this O-FSC transaction. However, TP-FSC did not obtain actual title to the\n. CC:LM:FS:LI:POSTF-129710-02 page 3 Immediately after purchasing the\n,\nTP-FSC leased it to a subsidiary of the foreign Tax Exempt\nEntity.",

    "text": "It usually takes\nabout 2 weeks to get an SSN once the\nSSA has all the evidence and information it needs. Check that both the name and SSN\non your Forms 1040 or 1040-SR, W-2,\nand 1099 agree with your social security\ncard. If they don\u2019t, certain deductions\nand credits on Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nmay be reduced or disallowed and you\nmay not receive credit for your social\nsecurity earnings. If your Form W-2\nshows an incorrect SSN or name, notify\nyour employer or the form-issuing agent\nas soon as possible to make sure your\nearnings are credited to your social security record. If the name or SSN on\nyour social security card is incorrect,\ncall the SSA. Once you are issued an SSN, use it to\nfile your tax return. Use your SSN to file -14- your tax return even if your SSN does\nnot authorize employment or if you have\nbeen issued an SSN that authorizes employment and you lose your employment authorization. An ITIN will not be\nissued to you once you have been issued\nan SSN. If you received your SSN after\npreviously using an ITIN, stop using\nyour ITIN. Use your SSN instead. IRS Individual Taxpayer\nIdentification Numbers\n(ITINs) for Aliens If you are a nonresident or resident alien\nand you don\u2019t have and aren\u2019t eligible to\nget an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN. If you already have an ITIN, enter it\nwherever your SSN is requested on your\ntax return. Some ITINs must be renewed. If you\nhaven't used your ITIN on a federal tax\nreturn at least once for tax years 2019,\n2020, or 2021, it expired at the end of\n2022 and must be renewed if you need\nto file a federal tax return in 2023. You\ndon't need to renew your ITIN if you\ndon't need to file a federal tax return. You can find more information at\nIRS. gov/ITIN. ITINs assigned before 2013\nTIP have expired and must be renewed if you need to file a tax\nreturn in 2023. If you previously submitted a renewal application and it was approved, you do not need to renew again\nunless you haven't used your ITIN on a\nfederal tax return at least once for tax\nyears 2019, 2020, or 2021. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't\nentitle you to social security benefits or\nchange your employment or immigration status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, including application, expiration, and renewal, see Form W-7 and its instructions. If you receive an SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS\noffice or write a letter to the IRS explaining that you now have an SSN and\nwant all your tax records combined under your SSN. Details about what to include with the letter and where to mail it\nare at IRS. gov/ITIN.

When examined within the framework of the entire\nagreement, it is apparent that this provision is there to prevent the Commissioner from\nsubsequently changing the inventory calculation by challenging the criteria upon which\nthe calculation is based (and thus circumventing its agreement not to change the preYear 2 inventory calculations). Moreover, the taxpayer\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the intent of the parties as\nevidenced by the written agreement. An interpretation of the agreement that compels\nthe Commissioner to accept the taxpayer\u2019s LIFO methodology (to the extent it was in\nplace as of Date 7) is contrary to the acknowledgement in the agreement that neither\nparty intended to admit the correctness of the other\u2019s position.
