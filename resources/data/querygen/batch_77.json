Married Filing Separately\nCheck the \u201cMarried filing separately\u201d\nbox at the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nif you are married, at the end of 2022,\nand file a separate return.

Different\nrules apply to people in community\nproperty states; see Pub. 555. However, you will usually pay more\ntax than if you use another filing status\nfor which you qualify. Also, if you file a\nseparate return, you can't take the student loan interest deduction or the education credits, and you will only be able\nto take the earned income credit and\nchild and dependent care credit in very\nlimited circumstances. You also can't\ntake the standard deduction if your\nspouse itemizes deductions.

On September 14, 2011, a memorandum with the subject line \u201cAttorney Fees Incurred\nto Defend Against Patent Infringement Claims and to Investigate Patents\u201d was issued to\nyou, hereinafter referred to as the September 14, 2011 Memorandum. The September\n14, 2011 Memorandum opined that attorney fees incurred to defend actions for patent\ninfringement pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) for submitting Abbreviated New Drug\nApplications (ANDAs) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking to market\nand sell generic drugs before the expirations of the listed patents must be capitalized. The September 14, 2011 Memorandum also opined that the investigatory patent\nresearch fees must be capitalized. The questions relative to the cost recovery of the\ncapitalized attorney fees were reserved. This memorandum responds to your request for assistance on the cost recovery of the\ncapitalized attorney fees. This advice may not be used or cited as precedent. LEGEND\nCorporation X = -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Entity Y\n= -------------------------------------------Entity Z\n= ------------------------------------------------------ANDA One\n= -----------------------ANDA Two\n= -----------------------ANDA Three = ------------------------ POSTU-139175-10\nLicense Y\nLicense Z\nDrug #3\nDrug # 4 2\n=\n=\n=\n= ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ISSUES\n1. Whether the cost recovery of capitalized attorney fees incurred by Corporation X\nwhen investigating patents and defending against infringement suits to obtain\nFDA-approved ANDA One must be suspended until the ANDA is amortizable\nand, if so, when is an ANDA amortizable. 2. When ANDA infringement litigation settles with the ANDA holder receiving a\nlicense, whether the cost recovery of capitalized attorney fees incurred when\ninvestigating patents and defending against infringement suits should be\ncapitalized to the license obtained in settlement of the ANDA infringement\nlitigation. 3. Whether the annual cost recovery of attorney fees capitalized to ANDAs and\nlicenses are subject to I.R.C. \u00a7 263A. CONCLUSIONS 1. As franchises, FDA-approved ANDAs are amortizable I.R.C. \u00a7 197 intangibles,\nthat are amortizable ratably over a 15-year period beginning on the first day of\nthe month the FDA-approved ANDA is acquired, provided all applicable\nexclusionary periods have expired and provided that the trade or business\nrequirement of \u00a7 197 is met. Section 197 prohibits amortizable \u00a7 197 intangibles\nfrom being depreciated or amortized under any other provision, with treating\nANDA One as a franchise for cost recovery purposes the primary position. Alternately, as government-granted rights within Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)4(d)(5)(i), rights granted pursuant to ANDAs are licenses or other similar\ngovernment-granted rights within the meaning of I.R.C \u00a7 197(d)(1)(D), with the\ncost recovery the same as for franchises. 2. When ANDA infringement litigation settlements result in the plaintiffs granting the\nANDA holders licenses to market and sell the drugs the subject of the ANDAs,\nthe fees incurred to investigate the patents and to defend against the\ninfringement suits would be capitalized to the basis of the licenses and\nsuspended until the licenses are amortizable or depreciable. If the licenses are\nfor the use of \u00a7 197 intangibles, the attorney fees would be recovered pursuant to\n\u00a7 197.",

    "text": "Corporation X\u2019s ANDAs fit neatly into the I.R.C. \u00a7 1253(b)(1) definition since the ANDAs give Corporation\nX the right to market and sell its ANDA products within the United States, a territory that encompasses the\nentire country. Courts have noted that Congress provided an \"expansive definition\" of franchise to\n\u201cinclude\u201d agreements to sell or distribute goods within a specified area, which does not exclude other\nthings otherwise within the meaning of a franchise. See, e.g., Jefferson-Pilot Corp. v. Commissioner, 98\nT.C. 435, 443 (1992), aff'd 995 F.2d 530 (4th Cir. 1993) (FCC licenses are agreements \u201cbetween the\nFederal Government and the licensee, under which the licensee agrees to provide the service of radio\nbroadcasting within a specified area in exchange for the right to broadcast\u201d). See also, Jefferson-Pilot\nCorp. v. Commissioner, 995 F. 2d 530 at 531 (4th Cir. 1993)(\u201cThe definition of term \u2018franchise\u2019 is\nsufficiently broad to include licenses issued by the FCC.\u201d). That the right to market and sell came from the FDA, not the Federal Communications Commission\n(FCC), is a distinction without a difference \u2013 both the FDA and FCC are granting, for a territory,\ncommercialization rights. See also Addendum A, last 3 pages (enumerating the quality controls and other\nrestrictions imposed on the ANDA holder to retain the rights to market and sell, with the controls similar in\nnature to the \u201cstrings\u201d a franchiser would retain over its franchise, e.g., quality controls). In addition, the\nidentified categories of expenditures that must be capitalized are construed broadly, and not limited by\nnarrow technical arguments. T.D. 9107, 2004-1 C.B. 447 \u00a7 II. D. Accordingly, FDA-approved ANDAs\nthat allow the marketing and selling of new drugs in the United States are franchises within the meaning\nof Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i). POSTU-139175-10 42 investigating or otherwise pursuing the transaction is determined\nbased on all of the facts and circumstances. In determining\nwhether an amount is paid to facilitate a transaction, the fact that\nthe amount would (or would not) have been paid but for the\ntransaction is relevant, but is not determinative. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)(1)(emphasis added). The term \u201ctransaction,\u201d as used above, is also clearly defined in the regulations, as\nfollows:\n(3) Transaction. For purposes of this section, the term transaction\nmeans all of the factual elements comprising an acquisition or\ncreation of an intangible and includes a series of steps carried out\nas part of a single plan. Thus, a transaction can involve more than\none invoice and more than one intangible. For example, a\npurchase of intangibles under one purchase agreement constitutes\na single transaction, notwithstanding the fact that the acquisition\ninvolves POSTU-139175-10 43 multiple intangibles and the amounts paid to facilitate the\nacquisition are capable of being allocated. . . .\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)(3)(emphasis added). The transactions at issue in this case, which generated the fees at issue, arose from\nCorporation X\u2019s filing of ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications to obtain FDA-approved\nANDAs allowing Corporation X to market and sell generic pharmaceuticals in the\nterritory of the United States prior to the expiration of the United States patents for the\nreferenced NDA-approved drugs.",

    "text": "Section 3121(u)(2) generally extends the Medicare portion of FICA tax to wages for\nservice performed by employees of states, political subdivisions, and wholly owned instrumentalities\nthereof hired after March 31, 1986. POSTF-123043-08 16 under the section 218 agreement means that the worker is an employee for FICA (both\nMedicare and social security) tax purposes, the Medicare-only 218 agreement\nestablishes contractual liability for Medicare tax only. Accordingly, retroactive Medicare\ntax liability would be the only part of the FICA that would be barred from potential 530\nrelief with respect to the covered workers. The employer could still qualify for\nretroactive section 530 relief from the social security tax. Another issue is whether an employer can obtain section 530 relief for income tax\nwithholding liability if relief from Medicare tax is unavailable because the employee is\ncovered under a section 218 agreement. There is no provision in Chapter 24,\nCollection of Income Tax at Source, similar to section 3121(d)(4), providing that a\nworker covered under a section 218 agreement is an employee. Because the\nAdministrator's determination that an individual is covered under a section 218\nagreement would generally be based on the common law rules, a similar result should\nbe reached with respect to liability for income tax withholding after coordination with the\nAdministrator. The Service, however, has jurisdiction over the determination of whether\nstate and local workers are employees for federal income tax withholding purposes. As\nnoted above, the facts in this case support the view that ------ members are officers\nsubject to income tax withholding under section 3401(c). The income tax withholding provisions have always been exclusively under the\njurisdiction of the Service regardless of whether the workers are state and local\nemployees under section 218 agreements. State and local governmental employees\nwere, of course, subject to income tax withholding at the time of passage of section 530\nand no exception was provided for application of section 530 to the income tax\nwithholding liability arising from the services of such workers. Accordingly, if the requirements of section 530 are met, state and local employers may\nobtain retroactive section 530 relief with respect to social security tax and income tax\nwithholding liability if the reclassified worker is covered under a Medicare-only section\n218 agreement. As a general rule, relief under section 530 continues as long as the employer satisfies\nthe reporting consistency rule (by issuing Forms 1099 when required), the substantive\nconsistency rule, and the reasonable basis test. Under the substantive consistency\nrule, the employer must treat any workers in substantially similar positions as not being\nemployees to obtain section 530 relief. The withholding of FICA taxes is treatment of a\nworker as an employee under section 3.03 of Rev. Proc. 85-18. In the case of state and\nlocal government entities that are granted relief from income tax withholding liability but\nnot FICA taxes, the question is raised whether relief from income tax withholding liability\nwill apply prospectively, because the entities will be withholding and paying FICA taxes. The substantive consistency rule would seem to prevent the entity from obtaining\ncontinuing section 530 relief and require the withholding of income tax prospectively.",

    "text": "For financial accounting purposes, Taxpayer debited general revenue and credited\nretained earnings in the amount of the BEA payments. We have not identified any evidence to indicate that the BEA payments were\nintended to compensate or reimburse Taxpayer solely for any capital investments or\nimprovements. It is our opinion that based upon the information provided, the Fund's\nmotivation for making the BEA payment was to supplement Taxpayer's operating\nincome, thereby creating an incentive for Taxpayer to expand investment, lending and\ndeposit activities in distressed communities. We also note that this case is factually distinguishable from Southern Family,\nsupra. The BEA payments at issue are calculated based upon the increased value of\nthe applicant\u2019s qualifying activities to provide an incentive for sustained investment,\nlending and deposit activities in distressed communities. As reflected in the NOFA,\nTaxpayer\u2019s assistance through deposits to a community development financial\ninstitution must be uninsured or provided at an interest rate that is materially below\nmarket rates. This reflects an intent to provide a supplemental return on an investment POSTF-147002-10 9 with a higher risk (if uninsured) or a lower return (if made at a below market interest\nrate). The BEA payments are also distinguishable from Southern Family because\nTaxpayer did not have any contact with the Fund or engage in any negotiations with the\nFund. The BEA payments are unilaterally prescribed by the Fund. See 12 CFR \u00a7\n1806.203(f); 72 Fed. Reg. at 192, 195. Moreover, unlike in Southern Family, Taxpayer\naccounted for its receipt of the BEA payments in its financial accounting records by\ndebiting its general revenue account and crediting its retained earnings account in the\namount of the BEA payment for each of the years *** c and *** d. The taxpayer in\nSouthern Family was subject to strict accounting requirements and treated the payment\nas a capital contribution on its financial statements. Analysis under Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R. It is also our opinion that Taxpayer does not satisfy four of the five characteristics\nof a nonshareholder contribution to capital, as established by the Supreme Court. The\nremaining characteristic is immaterial as the BEA payment was made in cash and, thus,\nbenefitted Taxpayer in the amount of the BEA payment. See TAM 9238007 (June 10,\n1992). Therefore, it is our opinion that the BEA payments received by Taxpayer during\nthe taxable years *** c and *** d are not excluded from gross income under section 118. First, the BEA payments did not become a permanent part of Taxpayer\u2019s working\ncapital, nor were the BEA payments used by Taxpayer for the acquisition of any capital\nassets. Taxpayer accounted for the receipt of the BEA payments by increasing its\ngeneral revenue account. Taxpayer used the BEA payments to pay current operating\nexpenses. The BEA payment cannot qualify as a contribution to capital where it is used\nfor operating expenses as any other operating revenue would be used. Texas & Pacific\nRailway Co. v. U.S., 286 U.S. 285, 290 (1932). Taxpayer's use of the BEA payments to\npay operating expenses merely subsidized its current operations. Therefore, the BEA\npayments did not become a permanent part of Taxpayer\u2019s working capital structure. Second, the BEA payments were payments for specific services provided.",
