    "text": "Thus, the application of the plain meaning rule here makes clear that Congress granted\nthe Secretary broad authority to determine when, and under what circumstances, the\nmatching principle of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) should be applied. POSTF-108700-08 12 This is even more apparent when the words of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3) are considered\n\u201cin their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d FDA v.\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000). I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3)\ndirects the Secretary to \u201capply the matching principle of paragraph (2) in cases in which\nthe person to whom the payment is to be made is not a United States person.\u201d Nothing\nin I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) itself, however, says that that provision does not apply where \u201cthe\nperson to whom the payment is to be made is not a United States person.\u201d On the\ncontrary, taken alone, its terms establish that it does. I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) makes no\ndistinction between transactions between two domestic taxpayers and those between a\ndomestic taxpayer and a foreign entity. Thus, as the Third Circuit explained, if \u201cthe plain\nmeaning of section 267(a)(3) requires the Secretary to apply exactly the same matching\nprinciple of section 267(a)(2) to foreign persons, then the language of section 267(a)(3)\nis redundant.\u201d Tate & Lyle, 87 F.3d at 104. To avoid redundancy, I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3)\nmust be understood as authorizing something broader. Taxpayer Argues that the Regulation Violates the \u201cPlain Meaning\u201d of I.R.C. \u00a7267(a)(3) The taxpayer argues that \u201cbecause ----- would not have included the interest\nincome in income for U.S. tax purposes under Article --- of the U.S.- Country A Treaty,\nthe matching concepts underlying sections 267(a)(2) and 267(a)(3) should not be\napplied. Section 267(a)(2) was designed to address timing issues only when income is\nincluded for U.S. tax purposes . . .\u201d Protest at 29-30. In other words, taxpayer contends\nthat the plain meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3) requires regulations allowing companies in\nits situation to deduct interest when accrued, and that the Treas. Reg. 1.267(a)\u20133\nviolates this \u201cplain meaning\u201d by forcing it to use the cash accounting method. The taxpayer is correct in pointing out that there is a \u201cmismatch\u201d between ------(non taxable) income and ------------------------ (deductible) interest expense, but the\nstatute does not dictate exactly how this mismatch is to be resolved. The resolution of\nthe problem is delegated to the Secretary to address by regulation. As the Third Circuit\nrecognized, the literal terms of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) would suggest that a taxpayer would\nnot be entitled to any deduction: \u201cif the matching principle of section 267(a)(2) was\nstrictly applied here, the U.S. payor would never be entitled to an interest deduction\nbecause the related foreign payee would never have to include interest in taxable\nincome under a tax treaty with the United States.\u201d Tate & Lyle, 87 F.3d at 104. It was\nto avoid this result, which Congress viewed as \u201cunduly harsh,\u201d that the Secretary was\nauthorized to address, by regulation, amounts owed to foreign payees.",

The distribution\nmust be from a plan maintained by the\nemployer from which you retired as a\npublic safety officer. Also, the distribution must be made directly from the plan\nto the provider of the accident or health\nplan or long-term care insurance contract.

    "text": "Thus, in the partnership area, the lookthrough occurs at the ten percent mark and above. Passive/equity\ntreatment occurs below the 10 percent cut off. Accordingly, in\nvaluing a ten-percent-or-more corporate partnership interest\nunder Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii), equity valuation should CC:LM:HMT:CIN:1:POSTF-168001-03 Page 9 not apply. Instead, such partner should look through to the\nproportionate share of the gross assets of the partnership for\npurposes of apportioning all interest expense. Based upon the above analysis, we believe that when\napportioning a partner\u2019s other (non-partnership-incurred)\ninterest expense under the FMV method, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.8619T(e)(2), operating in tandem with Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.8619T(h)(1)(ii), requires a greater-than-10-percent corporate\npartner to look through and take into account its proportionate\nshare of the gross assets of the partnership. We have generated this opinion in light of the imminent\nclosing of the case to Appeals. Upon consideration of the issue\nby Appeals, we suggest that this issue is one which would benefit\nfrom a request for Technical Advice.

TROGOLO\nAssociate Area Counsel\n(Large & Mid-Size Business) By: _____________________________ JAMES E. KAGY\nSenior Counsel\n(Large & Mid-Size Business) CC:LM:HMT:CIN:1:POSTF-168001-03 Page 10 Attachment to POSTF-168001-03\nTAXPAYER\nNPA # I31\nSubject: Interest Expense Apportionment / Treatment of Partnerships in the FMV Election Context The major issue is to assess whether or not the B partnership interest represents a tangible asset\nand/or whether or not TAXPAYER should look through the partnership for purposes of applying\nthe FMV formula. In filing its US Federal income tax return, TAXPAYER took the position that Treas. Reg. 1.8619T(h) provides authoritative guidance as to the procedures to apportion interest expense under\nthe fair market value method. It was TAXPAYER\u2019s position that, to the extent that 1.861-9T(h)\nprovides guidance for computational matters, this regulation should control over other provisions\n(such as Treas. Reg. 1.861-9T(e)). Treasury Regulation 1.861-9T(h) affirmatively states that the\napportionment should be based on the aggregate fair market value of the assets of the taxpayer\nand its pro rata share of assets held by related persons. Because TAXPAYER does not own\nmore than 50% in the B partnership, B should not be treated as a related person for purposes of\nthese regulations (see below). Applying the \u201c10% rule\u201d of Temp. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(e)(2) to the B\nfact pattern would result in a different computation than the one that is seemingly prescribed by\nthe authority of Treas. Reg. 1.861-10T(h), which establishes a 50% and not a 10% ownership\nthreshold for determining whether the taxpayer should use the FMV of its investment vs. the\nFMV of the taxpayer\u2019s distributive share of another entity\u2019s assets for interest apportionment. 1. B Not A Related Person Under the FMV Method Regulations The essence and spirit of the fair market value regulations is to look through all related entities\nand capture the underlying assets and income. Treasury Regulation \u00a71.861-9T(h)(1) defines a\nrelated person for the fair market value method by a cross reference to Treas. Reg. \u00a71.8618T(c)(2). Treas. Reg. \u00a71.861-8T(c)(2) defines the term \u2018related person\u2019 as two or more persons\nin a relationship described in \u00a7267(b)(3).",
