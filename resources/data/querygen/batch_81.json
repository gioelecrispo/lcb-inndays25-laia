There is a reasonable cause defense to the section 6694(a)\npenalty (not the section 6694(b) penalty). Preparer would bear\nthe burden of establishing reasonable cause. Given the expertise\nand experience of Preparer\nwith\nthe research credit and the fact that Preparer used actual\nfigures for tax years for which the Taxpayer ultimately submitted\nclaims, we believe it would be extremely difficult for Preparer\nto establish reasonable cause for failing to comply with a simple\nprocedural requirement that is readily apparent from the plain\nlanguage of the Code.

    "text": "Although, section 83 overrides the \u201cdirect and\nproximate benefit\u201d exception to a section 162 deduction in\nsituation, we will analyze the facts of this case\nunder that exception. Section 162\nSection 162(a) allows a deduction for ordinary and necessary\nbusiness expenses, including a reasonable allowance for salaries\nor other compensation for personal services actually rendered. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.162-7 specifies that stock options awarded to\nemployees will constitute allowable deductions when such payments\nare made in good faith and as additional compensation for the\nservices actually rendered by the employees. Business expenses\nwhich satisfy the ordinary and necessary expense requirements of\nsection 162 are deductible if they are \u201cproximately connected to\nthe business of the taxpayer claiming deduction.\u201d Eustice, Tax\nProblems Arising From Transactions Between Affiliated or\nControlled Corporations, 23 TAX L. REV. 451, 475. The basic tax rule is that a parent and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries are treated as separate entities no matter how\nclosely affiliated. Generally, the courts have held a parent may\nnot deduct the expenses of its subsidiary, even though those\nexpenses would otherwise be ordinary and necessary trade or\nbusiness expenses. Interstate Transit Lines v. Commissioner, 319\nU.S. 590 (1943); Deputy v. Dupont, 308 U.S. 488 (1940). The\nconcept is that the payment by the parent to cover such expenses\nis related to the business of the subsidiary and not its own\nbusiness, and as such is not deductible by the parent. Interstate\nTransit Lines, 319 U.S. at 594; Young & Rubicam, 410 F.2d at\n1238-39; Columbian Rope Co. v. Commissioner, 42 T.C. 800 (1964). This rule was designed to prevent the members of a controlled CC:LM:F:MAN:1:POSTF-112619-02 page 5 group from voluntarily shifting expenses among themselves in\norder to maximize favorable tax consequences. National Carbide\nCorp. v. Commissioner, 336 U.S. 422, 434-36 (1949). However, the courts have carved out a narrow exception to\nthe general rule. Under unique and compelling circumstances, a\nsection 162 deduction may be allowable by a parent if it paid the\nsubsidiary\u2019s business expense for its own direct and proximate\nbenefit or was incurred by the parent with the underlying\nmotivating purpose of protecting and promoting its own business. 1\nYoung & Rubicam, 410 F.2d at 1238-39; Lohrke v. Commissioner, 48\nT.C. 679 (1967); Columbian Rope, 42 T.C. at 815-16. For the exception to apply, a parent must prove that each\nindividual performed specific services clearly for the parent\u2019s\nown direct and proximate benefit. I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a); INDOPCO, Inc.\nv. Commissioner, 503 U.S. 79, 84 (1992); Welch v. Helvering, 290\nU.S. 111, 115 (1933); Young & Rubicam, 410 F.2d at 1239. Where\nthe parent has proved, in detailed rather than simply general\nterms, that an individual was involved in this kind of activity,\na deduction by the parent for the compensation paid for these\nactivities is allowable. Columbian Rope, 42 T.C. at 815-16. A\ntaxpayer is required to keep adequate records sufficient to\nenable the Commissioner to determine the taxpayer\u2019s correct tax\nliability. I.R.C. \u00a76001; Meneguzzo v. Commissioner, 43 T.C. 824,\n831 (1965). In the absence of persuasive corroborating evidence,\nthe Commissioner is not required to accept the self-serving\ntestimony of interested parties. Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of\nU.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 512 (1984).",

Deprecation of payphones Unlike other payphone investment schemes,\nmade no claims\nthat its payphones complied with the Americans with Disabilities\nAct so that the payphones were eligible for the Disabled Access\ncredit under I.R.C. ' 44. Instead, investors typically reported\nthe payphone income on a Schedule E and claimed depreciation on\nthe payphones which generated tax losses. The investors are not\nhowever entitled to claim depreciation on the payphones. In order to claim a depreciation deduction, a taxpayer must\nestablish that the property is used in a trade or business or\nheld for the production of income, that the property is of the\ntype subject to depreciation, and that the taxpayer has a\ncapital investment, or depreciable interest, in the property. See I.R.C. ' 167. A depreciable interest does not mean possession of bare\nlegal title alone. The test is whether the taxpayer would\nsuffer an economic loss as a result of a decrease in the value\nof the property due to depreciation or, in other words, does the\ntaxpayer possess the economic benefits and burdens of ownership. In Helvering v. F. & R Lazarus & Company, 308 U.S. 252 (1939),\nthe Supreme Court stated that the question is who bears the\nburden of exhaustion of the capital investment. See also Estate\nof Franklin v. United States, 544 F.2d 1045 (9th Cir. 1976). A\nnumber of factors have been identified by the courts in\ndetermining who has the benefits and burdens of ownership.",

As\nstated above, section 901(a) provides that the choice to elect either a credit or a\ndeduction for foreign taxes paid for any taxable year may be made or changed at any\ntime before the expiration of the period prescribed for making a claim for credit or refund\nof the U.S. tax imposed for such taxable year. Section 6511(d)(3)(A) describes the\nperiod of limitations for credit or refund referred to in section 901(a). This section was\namended on August 5, 1997, with the amendment being effective for taxes paid or\naccrued in the taxable years beginning after its enactment. 39 Thus, taxable year --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------is subject to the pre-amendment version of section 6511 and taxable year --------the\npost-amendment version.

Under the pre-amendment\nlanguage, both the IRS and the courts determined that the year referred to in the\nforegoing statutes is the same \u2014 the year the taxes were actually paid or accrued, and\nnot the later year to which excess credits were carried and \u201cdeemed\u201d paid or accrued\nunder section 904(c). 42 The court in Chrysler stated that, \u201cIn our view, the most\n38 Rev.

No disclosure of this\nmemorandum should be made without consultation with our office. You have requested our advice regarding the following issues:\n1. Whether the interest allocated to the equity accounts of the participants in the\nMutual Help Homeownership Opportunity program (the \u201cMHO\u201d) administered by ------------------Housing Authority (the \u201c----HA\u201d) is taxable. 2. If the interest is taxable, whether all of the interest allocable to a participant in\n2006 should be reportable for that year, or should only the amount actually\nearned in 2006 be reported for that year. 3. If the interest is taxable, whether ----HA is required to report the interest to the\nInternal Revenue Service (the \u201cService\u201d) and the program participants via Forms\n1099-INT. These issues will be addressed below. POSTU-116467-09 2 FACTS\nMHO Program Generally. The MHO, a program established by the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (\u201cHUD\u201d), is designed to help low-income Indian families achieve home\nownership. 1 Under the MHO, HUD pays for 50% of the price to construct a new home\nand the appropriate Indian Housing Authority (\u201cIHA\u201d) pays the other 50%. Eligible\nIndian families are then able to occupy the home on the condition that the family makes\na contribution to the IHA of not less than $1,500.00, which could be through contribution\nof land, labor, cash, materials, equipment or other similar means. The family must also\nparticipate in a home-buying counseling program. ----HA\u2019s MHO Program. ----HA administers a lease-to-own program under the MHO program using the\nstandard HUD Mutual Help and Occupancy Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). Terms of the Agreement. Under the Agreement, ----HA gives each program participant an opportunity to\nachieve home ownership in the project in return for fulfilling the participant\u2019s obligation\nto (1) make contribution to the development of the project, (2) make monthly payments\nbased on income, (3) provide all maintenance of the home, and (4) satisfy all other\nprogram requirements including an annual certification of income and family\ncomposition. 2\nCommencement of Occupancy. The term of the participant\u2019s lease under the Agreement commences on the first\nday of the calendar month following the date specified in the Date of Occupancy3 and\nexpires when the Initial Purchase Price4 has been fully amortized in accordance with the\n1 The regulations governing the MHO, 24 C.F.R. Part 950, Subpart E, has been withdrawn by HUD due to\nthe implementation of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1998\n(\u201cNAHASDA\u201d). Therefore, the MHO program is no longer offered by HUD. However, some individuals\nwho participated in the MHO program prior to the enactment of NAHASD are still in existence. Therefore,\nthe withdrawn HUD regulations are still helpful to understand the MHO program. 2 See Article 1.1 of the Agreement. 3",

    "text": "However, the safest approach is to get all the individual grantors and the\nfiduciaries for each of the grantor trusts to extend their respective statutes of limitations. Issue 2: Which Form 872 Should be Used to Extend the Statute of Limitations\nIRM section 25.6.22.4.1 states that a Form 872 or Form 872-A are the appropriate\nforms to extend the statute of limitations for income tax. However, you have asked\nwhether Forms 872-I should be secured. We understand that that Form is intended to\nbe used to extend the statute of limitations on partnership items under both Internal\nRevenue Code \u00a7\u00a7 6229 and 6501. In our opinion, a Form 872-I does not appear to\nprohibit extending the individual grantor\u2019s statute of limitations under \u00a7 6501 where the\nForm states, \"Without otherwise limiting the applicability of this agreement, this\nagreement also extends the period of limitation ... attributable to any partnership items\n(see section 6231(a)(3)) ....\" Therefore, we think the best practice is to have the\ngrantors extend their individual statute of limitations under \u00a7 6501 by executing a Form\n872-I. Similarly, the trust fiduciaries should be asked to execute Forms 872-I. Please note that our conclusions are based on the following assumptions:\n1. The subject grantor trusts are not electing small business trusts under \u00a7 641 (c). 2. None of the subject grantor trusts are partners in any TEFRA partnerships. POSTF-103406-08 7 3. The named individuals (-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------)\nare the grantors and/or owners of their respective grantor trusts.

If the\nrepresentative was acting on behalf of an employer or any firm or other entity in connection with the conduct\ngiving rise to such penalty, the Secretary may impose a monetary penalty on such employer, firm, or entity if\nit knew, or reasonably should have known, of such conduct. Such penalty shall not exceed the gross income\nderived (or to be derived) from the conduct giving rise to the penalty and may be in addition to, or in lieu of, any\nsuspension, disbarment, or censure of the representative. (c) After notice and opportunity for a hearing to any appraiser, the Secretary may \u2014\n(1) provide that appraisals by such appraiser shall not have any probative effect in any administrative\nproceeding before the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, and\n(2) bar such appraiser from presenting evidence or testimony in any such proceeding. (d) Nothing in this section or in any other provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of the\nSecretary of the Treasury to impose standards applicable to the rendering of written advice with respect to any\nentity, transaction plan or arrangement, or other plan or arrangement, which is of a type which the Secretary\ndetermines as having a potential for tax avoidance or evasion.

For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section,\ninformation is considered to be clearly identified as a supplement to or\nexplanation of the taxpayer's primary presentation of income, profit, or loss\nas reported on the face of the taxpayer's income statement if the\ninformation either-(A) Is reported in an appendix or supplement that contains a general\nstatement identifying all such supplemental or explanatory information;\n(B) Is identified specifically as supplemental or explanatory by a statement\nimmediately preceding or following the disclosure of the information;\n(C) Is disclosed in the context of making a comparison to corresponding\ninformation disclosed both on the face of the taxpayer's income statement\nand in the supplement or appendix; or POSTS-104573-11 6 (D) Is a disclosure of the effect on an item reported on the face of the\ntaxpayer's income statement of having used the LIFO method. For example, a restatement of cost of goods sold based on an inventory\nmethod other than LIFO is considered to be clearly identified as\nsupplemental or explanatory information if the supplement or appendix\ncontaining the restatement contains a general statement that all\ninformation based on such inventory method is reported in the appendix or\nsupplement as a supplement to or explanation of the taxpayer's primary\npresentation of income, profit, or loss as reported on the face of the\ntaxpayer's income statement. Section 1.472-2(e)(5), which is supposed to provide specific rules related to the\nexception of the conformity requirement for internal management reports, has been\nreserved. Analysis\nBecause the Taxpayer elected the LIFO method of accounting for federal income tax\npurposes, it is subject to the LIFO conformity requirements. See I.R.C. \u00a7 472(c), (e)(2);\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.472-2(e)(1).

The Taxpayer provided the same IFRS-only balance sheet and income statement\nprovided to the foreign parent to the lending bank. It also provided tabulated versions of\nthese documents that adjusted the IFRS amounts to arrive at U.S. GAAP amounts. Both the balance sheets and income statements involve the ascertainment of items of\nincome, profit, or loss. The balance sheets do not fall within the exception under\nTreasury Regulation section 1.472-2(e)(1)(ii), (4), which provides valuing inventory as\nan asset is not an ascertainment of income, profit, or loss, as the Taxpayer also used\nIFRS to ascertain retained earnings and net income on the balance sheets.",
