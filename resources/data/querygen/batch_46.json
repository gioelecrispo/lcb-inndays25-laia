Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule\n3, line 2). 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part\nIII). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number. You must enter each dependent's social security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered\nagree with the dependent's social security card.",

(1)(i) If a taxpayer receives an advance\npayment in a taxable year with respect to an agreement for the sale of goods\nproperly includible in his inventory or with respect to an agreement (such as a gift\ncertificate) which can be satisfied with goods or a type of goods that cannot be\nidentified in such taxable year, and on the last day of such taxable year the\ntaxpayer \u2013\n(a) Is accounting for advance payments pursuant to a method described in\nparagraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for tax purposes.

In order to qualify for the 2-year deferral of Treas. Reg. \u00a71.451-5(c), a taxpayer must\nreceive an advance payment for the sale of goods properly includible in his inventory or\nwith respect to an agreement (such as a gift card) which can be satisfied with goods. The regulation first requires that a taxpayer receive an advance payment. An advance\npayment is any amount received by a taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting\nfor purchases and sales and to be applied against an agreement. The regulation next\nrequires that the amount is applied to an agreement. An agreement exists because the\namount (cash) is exchanged for a gift card.

The taxpayer, A, does not qualify for the deferral available under \u00a7 1.451-5, as to\nrestaurants that are not owned by the taxpayer because the amount received is not an\n\u201cadvance payment\u201d under \u00a7 1.451-5(a)(1) since the taxpayer, A, will not be redeeming\ngift cards with its own goods held for sale. In other words, the taxpayer, A, only owns\nand will supply the inventory for the restaurant that it owns, i.e., C. It does not have\ninventorial goods on hand to be consumed in the restaurants that it does not own, at\nwhich the gift cards will be redeemed. As to these other restaurants, the taxpayer, A, is\nonly in the business of providing management services and gift card selling services,\nnot supplying or selling its own meals. It will be transferring cash to the seller of the\nmeals, when a customer redeems the gift card through the sale of its own goods.",

Married Filing Separately\nCheck the \u201cMarried filing separately\u201d\nbox at the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nif you are married, at the end of 2022,\nand file a separate return. Enter your\nspouse\u2019s name in the entry space below\nthe filing status checkboxes.

Also, if you file a\nseparate return, you can't take the student loan interest deduction or the education credits, and you will only be able\nto take the earned income credit and\nchild and dependent care credit in very\nlimited circumstances.
