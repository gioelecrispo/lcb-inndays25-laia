    "text": "\u00a7 421(b). The tax consequences for the employee in a disqualifying disposition are\nessentially the same as the tax consequences for exercising a nonstatutory stock option\nunder \u00a7 83(a). Indeed, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.421-2(b)(1) provides that the rules of \u00a7\u00a7 83(a)\nand (h) apply to determine the tax consequences to the employee and the employer\ncorporation when the employer disposes of the stock in a disqualifying disposition. Because the employee is required to include the compensatory element of a stock\noption in gross income as a result of a disqualifying disposition, Congress provided that\nthe employer corporation may deduct the compensatory element. By permitting the POSTU-153378-08 9 deduction, Congress reinforced the policy that an employer may deduct the\ncompensatory element only if the compensatory element is includible in the gross\nincome of the employee. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.421-2(b)(1) provides that the employer may\ntake this deduction under \u00a7 162. 4. Taxpayer\u2019s Argument Corporation 1 argues that because the text of \u00a7 421(a)(1) specifically disallows a\ndeduction under \u00a7162 for compensation attributable to a statutory stock option then a\ndeduction for such compensation is allowable under another section of the Code. Section 421(a) provides for the exclusion of the compensatory element from an\nemployee\u2019s gross income. In essence, by claiming that it is entitled to a deduction\nunder \u00a7 174, Corporation 1 effectively seeks to receive the tax benefits of \u00a7 83(h), which\nprovides for a deduction for the employer, for ISOs and ESPPs that are eligible for tax\ntreatment provided in \u00a7 421(a). Effectively, Corporation 1 argues that it is entitled to a\ndeduction triggered by a disqualifying disposition without the disqualifying disposition\ntaking place and without an employee recognizing income. Corporation 1\u2019s argument and \u201cplain reading\u201d of \u00a7 421 are disingenuous. Corporation\n1\u2019s position violates congressional policy that an employer may deduct the\ncompensatory element of a stock option only if the compensatory element is included in\nthe gross income of the employee. In Albertson\u2019s Inc. v. Commissioner, 42 F.3d 537,\n545 (9th Cir. 1994), the Ninth Circuit reasoned that it \u201cmay not adopt a plain language\ninterpretation of a statutory provision that directly undercuts the clear purpose of the\nstatute.\u201d In Albertson\u2019s, the taxpayer argued that certain amounts paid into deferred\ncompensation agreements constituted interest and could be deducted under \u00a7 404. The Ninth Circuit, however, concluded that not withstanding the statutory language, the\ntaxpayer\u2019s interpretation would not be consistent with Congress\u2019s intent. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Albertson\u2019s should apply to this situation. Provided the\nrequired holding periods are satisfied, Congress intended to prohibit an employer\ncorporation from deducting the compensatory element of a statutory stock option. The\nlegislative history of \u00a7 421 reinforces the policy that an employer may deduct the\ncompensatory element of a stock option only if the compensatory element is included in\nthe gross income of the employee. Accordingly, Section 421(a)(2) does not permit a\ndeduction for the compensatory element attributable to statutory stock options because\nthe compensatory element is excluded from the employee\u2019s gross income. C. Conclusion As discussed earlier, Corporation 1 may not deduct the Spread of a statutory stock\noption under \u00a7 174.",

    "text": "Rev. Rul. 2004-41, 2004-1\nC.B. 845. Washington law provides that members of an LLC are\nnot personally liable for the LLC\u2019s debts and obligations. R.C.W. \u00a7 25.15.125. Therefore in Washington, the LLC is the\nemployer for purposes of federal employment tax liability. Rev.\nRul. 2004-41, 2004-1 C.B. 845.; see also IRS CCA 200235023, 2002\nIRS CCA LEXIS 66. We have identified no special circumstances\nthat would enable the Service to collect the taxes at issue from\nthe members\u2019 property. In this case, the multimember LLC ----------------------- was liable for the unpaid employment taxes,\nnot its individual members, ----------- and -------------. Subsequent to the LLC incurring the unpaid tax debt at\nissue, the LLC redeemed the 50 percent interest of -------------------------------, LLC. After the redemption, ------ was a\nsingle member LLC that had assumed the liabilities incurred\nprior to the redemption. The LLC liable for the debt continued\nwith one member; however, that member continued to be protected\nunder state law from liability for the obligations of the LLC. No provision of state law renders the member liable for the\nLLC\u2019s obligations because of the change in membership. GL-126770-09 5 After ------------ became the single member, the LLC did\nnot make an election to be taxed as a corporation. Therefore,\nthe entity was disregarded and treated as a sole proprietorship. For wages paid prior to January 1, 2009, the owner of the\ndisregarded entity, i.e. the individual, is the employer for\nemployment tax purposes, the same as a sole proprietorship. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7701-2(a); see Kandi v. United States, 2008\nTNT 190-20 (9th Cir. unpublished opinion).3 Upon the redemption of the interest of the withdrawing\nmember of the LLC, the LLC was disregarded for tax purposes so --------------, as the single member, became liable for\nemployment taxes incurred subsequently by the LLC. But that is\nirrelevant to the question whether the event of the member\u2019s\nwithdrawal terminated the limited liability of the members of --------------- for the liability of the LLC for the employment\ntaxes incurred when it was a multimember LLC taxed as a\npartnership. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iii) provides that an entity\nthat is otherwise disregarded as separate from its owner is\ntreated as an entity separate from its owner for purposes of\nfederal liabilities of the entity with respect to any taxable\nperiod for which the entity was not disregarded. Because the\ntaxable periods involved in this case date back to when the\ntaxable entity was a multi-member LLC that was not disregarded,\n---------------- and his property cannot be liable for taxes\nincurred during those periods. By virtue of the redemption and\nsettlement agreement, the LLC itself remains liable for the\nunpaid taxes and its property may be levied against. 3 That regulation has been revised to render a single-member LLC liable for\nemployment taxes as the employer, even though it is disregarded for other\nfederal tax purposes. Because the revised regulation is effective for wages\npaid on or after January 1, 2009, it has no effect on the analysis in this\ncase.

Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nCases If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case, income taxable to the bankruptcy estate and reported on the estate's\nincome tax return includes:\n\u2022 Earnings from services you performed after the beginning of the case\n(both wages and self-employment income); and\n\u2022 Income from property described in\nsection 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code\nthat you either owned when the case began or that you acquired after the case\nbegan and before the case was closed,\ndismissed, or converted to a case under a\ndifferent chapter. Because this income is taxable to the\nestate, don\u2019t include this income on your\n-23- own individual income tax return. The\nonly exception is for purposes of figuring your self-employment tax. For that\npurpose, you must take into account all\nyour self-employment income for the\nyear from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is appointed) must allocate between you and\nthe bankruptcy estate the wages, salary,\nor other compensation and withheld income tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for income and withheld income tax reported\nto you on Forms 1099. You must also\ninclude a statement that indicates you\nfiled a chapter 11 case and that explains\nhow income and withheld income tax reported to you on Forms W-2 and 1099\nare allocated between you and the estate. For more details, including acceptable\nallocation methods, see Notice 2006-83,\n2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at\nIRS.gov/irb/\n2006-40_IRB#NOT-2006-83.

To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from\n50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more\namounts to figure the amount to enter on\na line, include cents when adding the\namounts and round off only the total. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov.

    "text": "Section 1.46-3(d)(2)\nprovides examples of when property is in a condition of\nreadiness and availability. One of those examples is equipment\nthat is acquired for a specifically assigned function and is\noperational but undergoing tests to eliminate any defects. See\nalso Rev. Proc. 79-40, 1979-1 C.B. 13, where machinery and\nequipment were placed in service in the year critical tests\n(with appropriate materials) and operational tests were\ncompleted. Several Tax Court cases have held that facilities can be\ndeemed placed in service upon sustained power generation near\nrated capacity. However, a facility that operates on a regular\nbasis but does not produce the projected output may still be\nconsidered placed in service. Sealy Power, Ltd v. Commissioner,\n46 F.3d 382 (5th Cir. 1995), nonacq. 1996-1 C.B. 6. At a\nminimum, a property has to have been in a state of readiness\nsufficient to produce its product on a sustained and reliable\nbasis in commercial quantities to have been placed in service. See Sealy Power, Ltd., AOD 1995-010. And in Rev. Rul. 84-85,\n1984-1 C.B. 10, a solid waste facility that was experiencing\noperational problems such that it was unable to operate at its\nrated capacity was considered to have been placed in service\nsince it was being operated on a regular basis and saleable\nsteam was being produced. But if a facility is merely operating\non a test basis, it is not placed in service until it is\navailable for service on a regular basis. Consumers Power Co.\nv. Commissioner, 89 T.C. 710, 724 (1987). The above-referenced cases and rulings, which address\nelectric generating facilities, provide some parallels in\nevaluating a placed in service issue for section 29 facilities. The following factors are important in determining when a CC:LM:NR:----Page 20\nsynfuel plant is placed in service:\n(1) approval of required licenses and permits;\n(2) passage of control of the facility to taxpayer;\n(3) completion of critical tests; and\n(4) commencement of daily or regular operation. As stated above, the Service found that reaching the design\ncapacity is not a prerequisite to a determination that a\nfacility was placed in service. Rev. Rul. 84-85, 1984-1 C.B.\n103. In that ruling, the Service looked to daily operation of\nthe facility to determine the placed in service date. In Valley\nNatural Fuels v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1991-341, aff\u2019d in\nunpublished opinion, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 6739 (9th Cir. Mar.\n23, 1993), the court required an ethanol plant to be producing\nethanol of the quality for which the plant was designed prior to\nbeing placed in service. Likewise, however, a facility is not placed in service when\nit is merely at an interim stage of construction. Noell v.\nCommissioner, 66 T.C. 718, 729 (1976). Thus, the operation of\nequipment, such as q, prior to -------------------------------------, is an interim construction stage, and not placed in\nservice. The focus in determining a placed in service date should be\non ascertaining from the relevant facts and circumstances the\ndate the unit begins supplying product in such a manner that it\nis routinely available and is consistent with the unit=s design. To do so, one must examine relevant factors occurring both\nbefore and after the claimed placed in service date to verify\nthe commencement of commercial operations.",

    "text": "Here, even though\nthe funds in the equity accounts are held in trust by the ----HA for the benefit of the\nprogram participants, the funds, including interest earned thereon, remain property of\nthe program participants. Therefore, the interest earned on the funds in the equity\naccounts is fully taxable. However, the main issue is when the interest becomes\ntaxable to the program participants. Unlike the facts under Rev. Rul. 99-44, the MHO\nprogram participant\u2019s access to the funds held in the equity accounts, including interest\nearned thereon, are subject to substantial limitations and restrictions. Based on the treasury regulations and case law cited above, income is\nconstructively received by a taxpayer in the taxable year during which it is credited to\nhis account, set apart for him, or otherwise made available so that he may draw upon it\nany time, or so that he could have drawn upon it during the taxable year if notice of\nintention to withdraw has been given. However, income is not constructively received if\nthe taxpayer\u2019s control of its receipt is subject to substantial imitations or restrictions. Under the Agreement, the program participants\u2019 right to control and access the\nfunds, including the interest thereon, are subject to various limitations. For example,\nduring the period of occupancy, if ----HA determines that the home needs to be\nrepaired, ----HA has the right to use the funds in the participant\u2019s equity accounts as -------HA deems necessary. In addition, ----HA also has the right to pay for the utilities on\nbehalf of the participant and charge the participant\u2019s equity account. Although the\nprogram participant may use the funds in the equity account for the limited purpose of\nmaking improvements and additions to the home, ----HA has the right to determine\nwhether the participant will be required to replenish the equity account or if the funds\nare to be loaned to the participant at an interest rate determined by ----HA. In addition, although ----HA is authorized to use a portion of the participant\u2019s\nMEPA for low-income housing purposes (provided that a reserve of the participant\u2019s\nMEPA is maintained), ----HA must continue to credit the interest to each homebuyer\u2019s\naccount based on the MEPA balance and rate of interest that would have been earned\nif the funds were invested. Also, the Agreement specifically provides the participant cannot, without the\napproval of ----HA or HUD, assign, mortgage, or pledge any right in this Agreement or to\nany reserve or account. POSTU-116467-09 10 Given the limitations and restrictions set forth in the Agreement, a participant\u2019s\nright to the interest earned on the funds in his equity accounts is subject to substantial\nlimitations or restrictions. Under the Agreement, the participant may terminate the\nAgreement any time by providing written notice to ----HA. Upon termination of the\nAgreement, the balances in the participant\u2019s equity accounts will be used to pay certain\nmaintenance and replacement costs as well as any unpaid required monthly payment. If there is an excess in the equity accounts after payment of the maintenance and\nreplacement costs, such excess will be refunded to the participant, including all\nallocated interest earned on these equity accounts.",

The cash received by TSub was deposited with\na qualified intermediary (as defined in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-(1)(g)(4)) and was ultimately used to\npurchase two service stations located in City 1 and City 2, State 2. All of the time limits\nset forth in the \u00a7 1031 regulations were met with respect to the identification and\npurchase of the replacement property (i.e. service stations). On its Federal income tax return for the taxable year ending Date 3, Taxpayer reported\na gain of Amount 2 on the exchange. Taxpayer attached Form 8824, Like-Kind\nExchanges, to its Federal income tax return for the tax year ending Date 3. Even\nthough Line 15 of the Form 8824 indicates a multi-asset exchange, Taxpayer treated\nthe exchange as a single-asset exchange in its calculations in the Attachment to Form\n8824, which was the basis of Taxpayer\u2019s reported gain. 3 For purposes of the\ncalculation, Taxpayer characterized all the assets as tangible. The personal properties\nexchanged and received were not further classified in accordance with General Asset\nClasses or SIC codes as prescribed by the \u00a7 1031 regulations. Exam proposes to treat\nthe exchange as a multi-asset exchange. Exam requests advice regarding the proper classification of the pipelines used\nexclusively in the crude oil gathering system for purposes of determining the correct\ngain (if any) to be recognized as the result of this transaction. The County 1 pipeline is\ncomprised of approximately Amount 8 of Amount 9, Amount 10, Amount 11, and\nAmount 12 pipeline that is buried below plow depth. The County 2 pipeline is\ncomprised of approximately Amount 13 of Amount 14 pipeline that is buried below plow\ndepth. TSub and the unrelated third-party do not own the land across which the\npipelines cross, but enjoy numerous agreements with landowners that permit TSub and\nthe unrelated third-party limited access to and use of their land. The examination team\nproposes to classify the pipelines as personal property in accordance with State 1 law. LAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 1031(a) provides that no gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of\nproperty held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment (not including\nstocks, bonds, notes, choses of action, certificates of trust or beneficial interest and\ncertain other types of property not here pertinent) if such property is exchanged solely\nfor property of like kind which is to be held for productive use in a trade or business or\nfor investment. 3 Form 8824 Attachment.
