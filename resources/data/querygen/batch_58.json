If you don\u2019t file your return\nby the due date (including extensions),\nthe penalty is usually 5% of the amount\ndue for each month or part of a month\nyour return is late, unless you have a\nreasonable explanation. If you have a\nreasonable explanation for filing late, include it with your return. The penalty\ncan be as much as 25% of the tax due. The penalty is 15% per month, up to a\nmaximum of 75%, if the failure to file is\nfraudulent.

If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a qualiTIP fying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the\nEIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying\nchild. For more information, see Pub. 596. Example. Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the\nfive tax benefits listed here based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s AGI is higher than yours and you don\u2019t claim J as a qualifying child, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 596.

However, if \u201cValid for Work Only With DHS Authorization\u201d is printed on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC purposes only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid. To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number\n(SSN) near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't\nhave an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You\nCan't File on Time? If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of\nyour 2022 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC\non your original or an amended 2022 return. If a child didn't\nhave an SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (including extensions), you can't count that child as a qualifying\nchild in figuring the amount of the EIC on your original or an\namended 2022 return.

You had no tax shown on your\n2021 return and you were a U.S. citizen\nor resident for all of 2021. 2. The total of lines 25d, 26, and\nSchedule 3, line 11, on your 2022 return\nis at least 100% of the tax shown on\nyour 2021 return (110% of that amount\nif you aren't a farmer or fisherman, and your adjusted gross income (AGI)\nshown on your 2021 return was more\nthan $150,000 (more than $75,000 if\nmarried filing separately for 2022)). Your estimated tax payments for 2022\nmust have been made on time and for\nthe required amount. For most people, the \u201ctax shown on\nyour 2021 return\u201d is the amount on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24,\nminus the total of any amounts shown\non lines 27a, 28, 29, and 30; Schedule 3,\nlines 9, 12, 13b, 13g, and 13h; and\nForms 8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III\nthrough IX only), 8885, and 8919. Also\nsubtract from line 24 any:\n\u2022 Tax on an excess parachute payment,\n\u2022 Excise tax on insider stock compensation of an expatriated corporation,\n\u2022 Uncollected social security and\nMedicare or RRTA tax on tips or\ngroup-term life insurance, and\n\u2022 Look-back interest due under section 167(g) or 460(b). When figuring the amount on line 24,\ninclude household employment taxes\nonly if line 25d is more than zero or you\nwould have owed the estimated tax penalty for 2021 even if you didn't include\nthose taxes. If the Exception just described\ndoesn't apply, see the Instructions for\nForm 2210 for other situations in which\nyou may be able to lower your penalty\nby filing Form 2210. Figuring the Penalty If you choose to figure the penalty yourself, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farmers and fishermen). Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the\npenalty to any tax due and enter the total\non line 37. However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37. Don\u2019t file Form 2210 with your return unless Form 2210 indicates that you\nmust do so. Instead, keep it for your records. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. -60- Because Form 2210 is compli- TIP cated, you can leave line 38\nblank and the IRS will figure\nthe penalty and send you a bill. We\nwon't charge you interest on the penalty\nif you pay by the date specified on the\nbill. If your income varied during the\nyear, the annualized income installment\nmethod may reduce the amount of your\npenalty. But you must file Form 2210\nbecause the IRS can't figure your penalty under this method. Third Party Designee",

    "text": "Id. at 523. The NAIC continued to work on its RBC standards after the Special Committee\non Blue Cross Plans issued its final report in 1994. The current RBC standards will be\ndiscussed below as part of the response to the Taxpayer's argument. In summary, in the context of NAIC Annual Statement reporting, when the NAIC\nfirst considered \"cost-plus\" type arrangements, it rejected any analysis based on the\nlabel of the arrangement and instead determined that arrangements should be classified\nas \"insured\" or \"uninsured,\" even to the point of breaking an arrangement into\ncomponents and classifying each component as insured or uninsured. In the context of BCBS financial reporting, the NAIC initially used the phrase\n\"cost-plus\" to describe an arrangement that was classified as insured. The\narrangement included the following features:\n\"Experience rated groups for which premiums are fully determined\nretrospectively.\" \"Typically the plan pays the benefits and bills the account for the cost of benefits\nand normal retention items.\" \"The plan issues a Blue Cross & Blue Shield identification card, pays the benefits\nfrom its bank account, and uses its contractual payment arrangements with\nproviders in the administration of the contract.\" \"Often these accounts select aggregate and individual stop loss features for\nwhich the cost of coverage is included as part of retention or other separate\ncharge.\" The description used by the NAIC for BCBS financial reporting is similar to the\ndescription used by the BCBSA in its risk-based capital formula, where it described the\nmajor characteristics of ASC/Cost-Plus business to include:\n\"issuance of carrier ID cards and membership materials\"\n\"access to participating providers and associated discounts, if any\"\n\"retrospectively determined revenue.\" \"Cost-plus\" -- the Taxpayer's definition. In its Protest, the Taxpayer\nacknowledges that Congress did not define the term \"cost-plus contract\" when it POSTU-144536-09 19 amended section 833 in 1997. The Protest asserts \"the term has a well-understood\nmeaning in the insurance industry.\" Protest, page 13. However, rather than citing any\nindustry definition, the Taxpayer offers its own version of the term:\nCost-plus contracts have three essential features. First, the \"cost\" must be paid\nunder an arrangement in which the insurance company is a party to the\nobligation to make a payment. By contrast, \"cost\" is not involved under an ASO\nplan because the participant is the only party that pays or funds the obligation. Second, in the context of I.R.C. \u00a7 833(b) the \"cost\" must relate to heath-related\nclaim payments (other than those that are underwritten and qualify as insurance). The third feature of cost-plus contracts is that the insurance company receives\nreimbursement for the claims, \"plus\" a fee to cover any expenses and profit. Taxpayer's Program X plans satisfy each of these criteria and are commonly\nunderstood to be cost-plus arrangements. \"Cost-plus\" -- the Taxpayer's references to NAIC accounting materials. As\nnoted above, the Taxpayer's refund claims were prompted by an internal audit of the\nTaxpayer's NAIC Annual Statements. Accordingly, the Taxpayer's argument is\nprincipally based upon the Accounting Practices and Procedures of the NAIC and the\nNAIC's Risk-Based Capital standards.",
