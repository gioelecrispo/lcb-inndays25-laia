    "text": "Summary. We believe that an objective review of the treatment of \"cost-plus\"\narrangements by the NAIC, by the BCBSA, and by the IRS, establishes that much more\nis required than being a mere \"party to the obligation to make a payment.\" The only\nfeature that the NAIC's current description of \"Administrative Services Contracts\" (ASC)\nhas in common with arrangements that have been considered \"cost-plus,\" is the fact\nthat \"the reporting entity pays claims from its own bank accounts, and only\nsubsequently receives reimbursement from the uninsured plan sponsor.\" But, in the\nNAIC accounting materials, an ASO arrangement may also pay claims out of the\nadministrator's own bank accounts. The only difference between an ASO arrangement\nand an ASC arrangement, from the perspective of the NAIC, is the timing of the transfer\nof funds from the policyholder to the BCBS plan. In an ASO arrangement, the BCBS\nplan receives the funds before it makes a payment from its account. In an ASC\narrangement, the BCBS plan does not receive funds from the policyholder until after it\nhas paid the claim. The NAIC does not consider this difference significant and treats\nboth arrangements as uninsured. We do not believe that this single feature is sufficient\nto classify an Administrative Services Contract as a \"cost-plus\" contract for purposes of\nsection 833(b). NAIC accounting materials may have some relevance in the sense that the NAIC\nAnnual Statement and the Federal Income Tax Return both include a determination of\nincome. But the NAIC's Risk-Based Capital Rules serve a completely different purpose:\n\"measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a reporting entity to support\nits overall business operations.\" The fact that separate items on the RBC Report are\nsubject to the same risk charge does not establish that they are legally-equivalent\narrangements, with the same legal responsibilities.

ISSUES\n1. Whether the Year 10 transaction at issue constitutes a sale of assets for tax\npurposes. 2. Whether the non-recourse contingent payment notes from the Year 10\ntransaction constitute debt instruments. 3. Alternatively, if the Year 10 transaction is a contingent payment asset sale for tax\npurposes:\nA. Whether the regulations promulgated pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 338 and 1060\nmodify the application of Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-1(c) to allow all basis\nto be recovered before recognition of any gain, as in open transaction\nreporting, by treating the sale as divisible into seven separate sales for each Page 3 of 37 POSTF-134629-07\nclass of property, i.e. Classes I through VII, taxed serially in class order with\ndifferent gross profit ratios. B. Whether I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 453A and 483 apply and, if so, how said sections should\nbe applied. 4. Whether I.R.C. \u00a7 481 applies to tax all previously deferred income from the use\nof the installment method in the year under examination. CONCLUSIONS 1. The Year 10 transaction, in substance, is not a sale for tax purposes. 2. The non-recourse contingent payment notes do not constitute debt instruments. 3. Alternatively, if the form of the Year 10 transaction is respected:\nA. The regulations promulgated pursuant to Sections 338 and 1060 do not\nmodify the installment method of accounting to allow the equivalent of open\ntransaction reporting. B. The form of the transaction is a contingent payment asset sale for which the\nmaximum selling price is determinable and both \u00a7\u00a7 383 and 453A apply, as\naddressed below. 4. Section 481 applies to tax the previously deferred income in the year under\nexamination, as addressed below. FACTS\nA. Summary Most of the assets the subject of the Year 10 transaction were originally owned\nby Owner 1 ----------------, Owner 2 ---------------, and Owner 3 ----------------via a S\ncorporation. Owners 1 through 3 sold ** percent of their stock in the S corporation to a\nthird party for approximately $ **, with an I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10) election.

    "text": "3. Who is the Employer? Section 3401(d)(1) provides, that for purposes of income tax withholding, the term\nemployer means the person for whom an individual performs or performed any service, POSTF-123043-08 12 of whatever nature, as the employee of such person, except that if the person for whom\nthe individual performs or performed the services does not have control of the payment\nof the wages for such services, the term \u201cemployer\u201d (except for purposes of the\ndefinition of wages) means the person having control of the payment of such wages. Neither the FICA nor the FUTA contains a definition of employer similar to the definition\ncontained in section 3401(d)(1), relating to income tax withholding. However, Otte v.\nU.S., 419 U.S. 43 (1974), holds that a person who is an employer under section\n3401(d)(1), relating to income tax withholding, is also an employer for purposes of FICA\nwithholding under section 3102. Otte involved a trustee in bankruptcy who was an\nemployer under section 3401(d)(1) by virtue of having control over the payment of\nwages owed by the bankrupt. The Court stated, \u201cThe fact that the FICA withholding\nprovisions of the Code do not define \u201cemployer\u201d is of no significance, for that term is not\nto be given a narrower construction for FICA withholding than for income tax\nwithholding.\u201d Otte, 419 U.S. at 51. The Otte decision has been extended to provide\nthat the person having control of the payment of wages is also an employer for\npurposes of section 3111, which imposes the FICA tax on employers, and for purposes\nof section 3301, which imposes the FUTA tax on employers. It has been further\nextended to apply equally to the employer's FICA tax and to FUTA tax10. In re Armadillo\nCorp., 410 F. Supp. 407 (D. Col. 1976), aff'd, 561 F.2d 1382 (10th Cir. 1977), In re Laub\nBaking Co., 642 F.2d 196 (6th Cir. 1981), and STA of Baltimore -ILA Container Royalty\nFund v. U.S., 621 F. Supp. 1567 (D.C. Md. 1985), aff'd, 804 F.2d 296 (4th Cir. 1986)\nreached similar conclusions. The preliminary common law factor analysis you provided with regards to whether the ------- members are common law employees also seems to indicate that -------- is the\ncommon law employer and therefore liable for employment taxes under the statutory\nregime. However, we recognize that there may be arguments that another party, such\nas ------------------ or the ------------------------, is the common law employer. The\narguments raised by ---------\u2019s general counsel regarding the level of independence from\nother -------------district business as required by the state statutory scheme are\nconsistent with this general caveat. If -------- is not the common law employer of the -------members, it appears that --------would be the section 3401(d)(1) employer (\u201cstatutory employer\u201d), within the meaning of\nOtte and its progeny, because----------has control over the payment of wages to the -----members. As stated in your request for opinion, payments to the ------ members were\nbudgeted for in the general --------- budget, paid to each -------member individually from\nthe --------- checking account, and tracked within the --------- financial statements. There is no indication that --------- is reimbursed by any other party for the compensation\npaid to the ------ members. 10",
