    "text": "The settlement document does not explicitly allocate the money into one category or the\nother. However, the Federal statute as well as the State X statute that the suit invoked speak only\nof fines, not of damages. Additionally, the amount that Taxpayer paid was below the maximum\nthat either act allows for a penalty. Presumably, then, all settlement money that flowed to State\nX is non-deductible, all of it having been paid as penalty. State Y and State Z law are less clear\nabout whether an anti-trust monetary judgment is a penalty or simple damages. However, the\nfact that those states also filed their complaint under federal anti-trust statutes, and the amount\nthat Taxpayer paid was well within the penalty limits of that law, means that the payment can\nreasonably be treated as a penalty. Furthermore, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint specifically requests civil penalties, at paragraph\n51, while it does not specifically request compensatory damages anywhere. It would be\ninconsistent with the relief requested to assume that the Taxpayer\u2019s $amount1 payment\nconstituted deductible damages. Taxpayer may argue that the payment was compensation for damages in the three states,\nor that it was an amount paid outside of anti-trust law to settle the suit. It may point to the fact\nthat the settlement does not admit any wrongdoing on the company\u2019s part. The admission of\nwrongdoing is not necessary for IRC 162(f) to apply; all that is necessary is that the payment be\nmost properly characterized as a penalty. Here, Taxpayer paid $amount1 to settle anti-trust\nallegations, and had Taxpayer been found liable for these allegations, it would have been subject\nto a fine of up to $10 million. PREF-123891-07\n7 Conclusion\nTaxpayer\u2019s $amount1 payment in settlement of the anti-trust claims of States X, Y, and Z\nwas the payment of a penalty, and is thus not a deductible business expense under IRC 162(f).

    "text": "Since there was no value\ndistributed with respect to the common shares, petitioner argued\nthat section 332 did not apply with respect to the common shares\nand it was entitled to a loss pursuant to section 165(g). Respondent argued that section 332 applied to the\nliquidation and no loss was allowed with respect to the\ninvestment in the common shares. Respondent advanced two\narguments: 1) Spaulding Bakeries was erroneously decided and the\ndecision should be reconsidered; and 2) even under the rationale\nof Spaulding Bakeries, section 332 applies. H.K. Porter Company,\nInc., 87 T.C. at 693. The Tax Court rejected Respondent\u2019s argument that Spaulding\nBakeries was erroneously decided. The Court agreed with the\nSecond Circuit\u2019s focus in Spaulding Bakeries on the importance of\npriorities on dissolution. Id. at 694. The Court reasoned that\nsince the assets are distributed first to the preferred stock,\nand there was no property left for distribution to the common\nstock, the distribution was not a distribution with respect to\nall of the subsidiary\u2019s stock. Id. Therefore, section 332 did\nnot apply on the liquidation with respect to the common stock. In H.K. Porter Company, Respondent made two arguments to\nsupport its position that section 332 applied even under the\nreasoning of Spaulding Bakeries: 1) the preferred stock had\nvoting rights and, therefore, the distribution in the present\ncase cannot be considered \u201cimmaterial\u201d, and 2) substance prevails\nover form and, here, petitioner in substance held only one class\nof stock. Id. at 696. The Court refused to focus on the voting rights of the\npreferred stock. Instead, the Court focused on the liquidation\npreference of the stock and held that since no property was left\nfor distribution with respect to the common shares, section 332\nis inapplicable. Id. The Court also rejected Respondent\u2019s\nsubstance-over-form argument. Respondent argued that the\nsubstance of the transaction indicates that petitioner had only\none class of stock, since the preferred stock did not grant\npetitioner any benefits or privileges that it did not already\npossess as the only stockholder in the corporation. Id. at 697. In rejecting Respondent\u2019s argument, the Court focused on the\nfact that the preferred stock was issued approximately 10 years\nbefore Porter Australia was liquidated. The Court concluded that\nthe preferred stock \u201cwas not illusory or part of a financial\nfacade constructed of shuffled papers.\u201d Id. The Court discussed\nthat intercompany loans were capitalized into the preferred\nshares which carried specific rights and privileges. B. Analysis In our case, taxpayer produced a valuation report indicating\nthat -----and ----were insolvent after taking into account the\noutstanding loans from the taxpayer. The report valued the\nentities as ongoing concerns taking into account all tangible and\nintangible assets of the businesses. Therefore, taxpayer argues\nthat section 332 did not apply on the liquidations and it is\nentitled to worthless stock losses pursuant to section 165(g)\nwith respect to its stock in ---- and --. In addition, taxpayer\nargues that it is entitled to bad debt losses for the portion of\nthe loans not satisfied in liquidation (excess of outstanding\nloans over the value of the assets). The audit team has challenged taxpayer\u2019s position that ---and ----were insolvent at the time of the deemed liquidations. Specifically, it has challenged taxpayer\u2019s characterization of\nthe advances to ----and -----as debt.",

Hicks, Team Manager\nNatural Resources & Construction (Group 1495)\nJoseph A. Roussos\nField Specialists (Territory 1840 and Team 1846)\nA. Lee Keenan\nResearch Credit Technical Advisor from: Area Counsel, LMSB Area 1 (Financial Services) subject: I.R.C. \u00a7 6694 Penalty\nU.I.L. Nos. 6694.01-00 and 6694.02-00 This memorandum responds to your request for assistance\ndated December 28, 2002. The national office has reviewed and\nconcurred with the advice rendered herein. This memorandum\nshould not be cited as precedent. LEGEND\nTaxpayer\nPreparer\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nYear 4\nTime Period 1\nDate 1 =\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n= CC:LM:F:MAN:POSTU-162762-02 page 2 INTRODUCTION You have requested our advice on asserting a section1 6694\npenalty against Preparer\nfor making an\nimpermissible election for a reduced credit under section\n280C(c)(3)(\u201csection 280C(c)(3) election\u201d). This memorandum\ndiscusses Preparer\u2019s return preparation activities for Taxpayer. FACTS Preparer\nspecializes in advising\nclients on issues related to the section 41 credit for increasing\nresearch activities (\u201cresearch credit\u201d). On its original tax returns for its Year 1, Year 2, Year 3\nand Year 4 taxable years, the Taxpayer did not claim the research\ncredit. Subsequent to filing its returns for these taxable\nyears, the Taxpayer hired Preparer to review its activities,\nbooks and records for the purpose of claiming research credits on\namended returns. During Time Period 1, Preparer provided the\nTaxpayer with a research credit study. The study does not\ncaution the Taxpayer that it is only an example of how the Year\n1, Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4 taxable years could have been\ntreated. On Date 1, the Taxpayer used this study to file claims\nfor refunds for its Year 1, Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4 taxable\nyears. The preparation of the study was supervised by a Preparer\npartner In the research credit study, Preparer outlined its\nmethodology for identifying the Taxpayer\u2019s qualified research\nexpenses (\u201cQREs\u201d) and computed the Taxpayer\u2019s research credit,\nusing the actual figures for research expenditures and other\nitems for each of the years in question. When computing the\nresearch credit in the study, Preparer used a section 280C(c)(3)\nelection. The numbers from the Preparer study were mechanically\nplaced on the Forms 1120X filed with the Service. Preparer\nrendered advice which is directly relevant to the determination\nof the Taxpayer's entire claims for refund made on these Forms\n1120X. Preparer did not sign the Taxpayer\u2019s refund claims as a\npreparer, and at this point, we do not know whether Preparer or\nTaxpayer actually prepared the amended returns. As a result of\nPreparer\u2019s computation, the Taxpayer attempted to make a section 1 Unless otherwise noted, all section references are to the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. CC:LM:F:MAN:POSTU-162762-02 page 3 280C(c)(3) election on the refund claims it filed with the\nService. The Taxpayer\u2019s attempt to make a section 280C(c)(3) election\nresulted in understatements of the Taxpayer\u2019s income tax\nliability for the Year 1, Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4 taxable\nyears. That is, the attempted section 280C(c)(3) election\nresulted in the Taxpayer claiming refunds greater than the\nrefunds it could have claimed if it did not attempt to make the\nelection. ISSUE\nShould the Service consider asserting the section 6694\npenalty against Preparer for advising the Taxpayer to make an\nimpermissible section 280C(c)(3) election on a refund claim? CONCLUSION",

Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nCases If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case, income taxable to the bankruptcy estate and reported on the estate's\nincome tax return includes:\n\u2022 Earnings from services you performed after the beginning of the case\n(both wages and self-employment income); and\n\u2022 Income from property described in\nsection 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code\nthat you either owned when the case began or that you acquired after the case\nbegan and before the case was closed,\ndismissed, or converted to a case under a\ndifferent chapter. Because this income is taxable to the\nestate, don\u2019t include this income on your\n-23- own individual income tax return. The\nonly exception is for purposes of figuring your self-employment tax. For that\npurpose, you must take into account all\nyour self-employment income for the\nyear from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is appointed) must allocate between you and\nthe bankruptcy estate the wages, salary,\nor other compensation and withheld income tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for income and withheld income tax reported\nto you on Forms 1099. You must also\ninclude a statement that indicates you\nfiled a chapter 11 case and that explains\nhow income and withheld income tax reported to you on Forms W-2 and 1099\nare allocated between you and the estate. For more details, including acceptable\nallocation methods, see Notice 2006-83,\n2006-40 I.R.B. 596, available at\nIRS.gov/irb/\n2006-40_IRB#NOT-2006-83. Community Property States\nCommunity property states include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington,\nand Wisconsin. If you and your spouse\nlived in a community property state, you\nmust usually follow state law to determine what is community income and\nwhat is separate income. For details, see\nForm 8958 and Pub. 555. Nevada, Washington, and California\ndomestic partners. A registered domestic partner in Nevada, Washington,\nor California must generally report half\nthe combined community income of the\nindividual and their domestic partner. See Form 8958 and Pub. 555. Rounding Off to Whole\nDollars You can round off cents to whole dollars\non your return and schedules. If you do\nround to whole dollars, you must round\nall amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from\n50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3. If you have to add two or more\namounts to figure the amount to enter on\na line, include cents when adding the\namounts and round off only the total. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. If you are entering amounts that include cents, make sure to include the\ndecimal point. There is no cents column\non the form. The lines on Forms 1040 and\n1040-SR are the same.
