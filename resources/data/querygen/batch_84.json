    "text": "The fragile bark of a small business can be wrecked on just such\nuncharted shoals. Emeloid at 233. Despite the business need for management continuity, Section 264(a)(1) denies\ndeductions for premiums on any life insurance policy if the taxpayer is directly or\nindirectly a beneficiary under the policy. According to the within facts, the policies were\npossessed by the trust with the trustee named as benefi-ciary. The Trust Agreement, in\ndiscussing the disbursement of the life insurance proceeds, directed that the\ndisbursement would occur pursuant to the Stockholders' Agreement. Although no contemporaneous agreement was made, the Year 3 Stock Sale Agreement executed with\nA specifically detailed that the proceeds were to be used for the reacquisition of\ncorporate stock. POSTF-106186-02 7 While the trust document failed to reflect who was respon-sible for making the\npremium payments, and in fact relieved the trustee from such responsibility, the Year 3\nStock Sale Agreement named the corporation and the shareholders as obligated for the\npayments. Nevertheless, the audit revealed that the premium payments were wholly\nmade by the corporate taxpayer, with the corporation consequently seeking business\ndeductions for the payments. This situation is nearly identical to that confronted and analyzed in an earlier\nprivate letter ruling. LTR 6508270960A (Aug. 27, 1965). The only significant difference\nis that in that case, the trustee therein held possession of the stock certifi-cates\nwhereas the language of the applicable agreements in this matter states that the within\ntrustee will need to secure the share certificates from the relevant estate, suggesting\nthat the stockholders retained possession of the shares. Be that as it may, consistent with the letter ruling, the company is the true\nbeneficiary, directly or indirectly, under the policies in question since the reacquisition\nplan permits the orderly continuation of the business after the death of a share-holder. Id. Thus, the deductions are not allowed under \u00a7 264(a). Alternatively, the Service has already determined that premium payments as\nthose within do not constitute ordinary and necessary business expenses. In Rev. Rul. 70-117, 1970-1 C.B. 30, the Service determined that such premium expenses were in\nthe nature of amounts paid for the acquisition of a corporate asset, treasury stock, and\ntherefore not deductible under I.R.C. \u00a7 162. The purchase of stock, including the\nrepurchase by an issuing corporation of its own stock, is generally treated as a capital\ntransaction that does not give rise to a current deduction. LTR 96-41-001, n.3 (May 31,\n1996). Finally, since 1986 the Code has specifically denied deductibility of expenses for\na corporation's reacquisition of its shares. The current section reads in pertinent part,\n\"[N]o deduction otherwise allowable shall be allowed ... for any amount paid ... by a\ncorporation in connection with the reacquisition of its stock.\" I.R.C. \u00a7 162(k). Under the\nfacts presented, the payments by the corporation of the insurance premiums fall within\nthe broad \"in connection with\" language of section 162(k) since the proceeds of such\npolicies were obligated for the reacquisi-tion of the corporation's stock. Constructive Dividends to the Insured Stockholders When an individual shareholder receives an economic benefit through a\ndiversion of corporate earnings and profits, such receipt may be taxed as a constructive\ndividend.",

However, a facility\ndoes not have to achieve full design output to be placed in\nservice as long as it is in the process of ramping up its\nproduction levels. Subject to exceptions that are beyond the\ntaxpayer=s control, the Service has generally required actual\noperational use as a prerequisite for an asset to be deemed\nplaced in service. For this reason, it is critical to know when\nthe facility began producing synfuel, and whether this\nproduction continued to Aramp-up@ or ceased until significant\nproblems with the facility were corrected. Regarding facilities that are not operating as of the cutoff date, the facilities\u2019 readiness and availability to produce,\non a regular basis, commercial quantities of synfuel are\ncritical to determining whether it has been placed in service. In addition, subsequent production should reflect the same ramp- CC:LM:NR:----Page 21\nup to facility capacity. However, if the facility never\noperates at a significant production level, or in the same or\nnext tax year shuts down for any significant period of time to\ncorrect production problems, the earlier activity is likely in\nthe nature of start-up and testing, and the facility has not\nbeen placed in service. We believe that, based upon the facts as presently known,\nit is questionable whether any of the facilities were placed in\nservice by June 30, 1998. We believe that the facts concerning\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------are critical to this\nanalysis. To the extent that you can further develop these\nareas, it will make clearer the proper determination, and\naddress areas of ambiguity. a. As set forth above, in the absence of regulations\nspecific to section 29, we look to other published guidance of\nthe Service and other analogous Code sections to interpret the\nrequirement that the taxpayers were in the trade or business of\nproducing and selling synthetic fuel at the time that the\nfacilities were placed in service. In general, business operations must have begun for the\nsubject property to be considered placed in service. See,\nPiggly Wiggly Southern, Inc. v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. 739, 748\n(1985), nonacq. on another issue, 1988-2 C.B. 1, aff\u2019d on\nanother issue, 803 F.2d 1572 (11th Cir. 1986). Sporadic\nactivity may be merely start-up activity. The property cannot\nbe placed in service until the trade or business begins. Wall\nv. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1992-321; Richmond Television Corp.\nv.

To depreciate property, section 167 requires property to be\nused in a trade or business or for the production of income. However, activities that constitute a trade or business are not\ndefined in the regulations under 167. Similar provisions under\nsection 162 provide guidance. In pertinent part, section 162(a)\nallows as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses\npaid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any\ntrade or business.
