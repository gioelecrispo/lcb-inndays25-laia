Second, A sells gift checks directly to scrip organizations at a 10%\ndiscount, which in turn, resell the gift checks. A recognizes the discount at the time of\nsale for both book and tax purposes. Finally, A sells gift checks through online sales. The link to online sales is located on the B website; however, A processes the orders\nand directly receives payment. The link on the B website is strictly a service provided\nfor the benefit of --------. A maintains a small supply of gift checks on hand to fill orders\nfrom D stores, scrip organizations and online sales. A securely stores the unissued gift\nchecks in a warehouse until it needs to replenish its supply. The face of the gift checks is printed to read, in part, as follows:\nPay to the Order of any D\nPayable at E Bank, City, State, Zip Code\nSEE OTHER SIDE FOR DETAILS. The reverse of the gift checks is printed to read, in part, as follows:\nTo D (B or B system) \u2026 This is a check issued by [\u2026 A \u2026]. Please credit bearer $X and present to any\nbank. To Contacting Bank: Upon presentation, handle as a cash item payable at paying\nbank. 2 See The A versus B Litigation -----------------------. POSTF-149051-10 6 This gift check is worth $X and is redeemable toward the purchase of any product\nat most D restaurants in the United States. All taxes are payable by bearer. The gift checks are similar to actual checks that circulate in the economy as\nnegotiable instruments. The pre-numbered gift checks have separate checking account\nnumbers based upon the face value of the gift check and, like an actual check, are\nprocessed through the Federal Reserve System. The gift checks are honored by E\nwhen presented for payment. The gift checks are not dated and have no expiration\ndates. A orders the gift checks in batches, and A opens a new checking account each\ntime a batch of gift checks is produced. On average it takes about three (3) years to sell\nan entire batch of gift checks. Because the gift checks are associated with a specific bank account through\nwhich they clear, A establishes a general ledger account for each batch of gift checks\nby denomination.",

    "text": "However, A\u2019s direct sales of gift checks to online purchasers and scrip\norganizations are sales, and not deposits, in which the purchaser receives the right to\nreceive goods and services. Further, for the direct sales, D stores do not advance any\nfunds to the taxpayer, and A is not holding any of the proceeds from these sales as\ndeposits or funds held-in-trust for the benefit of the D stores. On the other hand, when A places gift checks with D stores to be sold by D\nstores to customers, the D store retains the ability to redeem the checks and recover\nthe funds. These funds held by A may be viewed as deposit or an amount held in trust\nfor the benefit of D stores. However, once a D store sells the gift check to a customer\nor other third-party,7 the store has no right to recover the funds. Thus, if the value of the\ngift check funds held by A is viewed as a D store deposit, the funds are no longer a\ndeposit when the D store sells the gift check to a customer. Taxpayer\u2019s reliance on the Seven-Up, supra, case is misplaced. such request with regard to taxpayer\u2019s method of accounting will require referral to the national office,\nCC:ITA:7.\n6 We conclude that the redemption amounts represent cost of sales (for A\u2019s previous gift check sales) that\nA may deduct when paid to the redeeming store, and the amounts received by the redeeming stores\nrepresent food sale revenue to the food establishment. 7 It is important to note that the D stores may be reimbursed not only by selling the gift check, but also by\nusing the gift checks as a means to pay employees, or for sale incentives, or otherwise. In all of these\ncases, the exchange is presumed to be an arms-length exchange for equal value. POSTF-149051-10 14 Taxpayer relies solely on Seven-Up Co. v. Commissioner, 14 T.C. 965 (1950)\nacq. 1950-2 C.B. 4, withdrawn and acq 1974-2 C.B. 4, to support its position that gift\ncheck sales proceeds are not taxable income. In that case, the Tax Court determined\nthat funds deposited with a soft drink company by its bottlers were not taxable income. In Seven-Up, the bottlers were given exclusive territories, and it was not feasible for any\nlocal bottler to conduct a national services campaign. Determining that a national\nadvertising campaign would be beneficial, the bottlers decided to combine their funds\nfor that purpose. The program was funded by contributions from the participating\nbottlers based on the volume of their beverage sales. Because the advertising agency had no means to administer the bottlers\u2019 multiple\ncontributions, the agency recommended that the bottlers make payments to the\ncompany. The agency and the company then entered into an agreement setting forth\nthe arrangement. The company consistently represented that it was a trustee or\ncustodian of the bottlers\u2019 funds in the discussions leading to the implementation of the\nfund and thereafter. Each time product was shipped to a bottler, the company sent a\nstatement reflecting the bottler\u2019s required contribution to the advertising fund. In turn,\nthe company paid the agency for advertising.",

    "text": "It should be noted that in Craig, the\nevidence established that the Steelers ticket policy allowed season ticket holders to\ntransfer season ticket holder status and the attendant right to renew if a $5 fee was\npaid. In Platt, the court found that although the Red Sox had a stated policy that did not\nallow tickets to be transferred, in practice, it had ignored the policy and allowed the\ntransfer of tickets for the previous five years. Walsh did not address this issue, but\nclearly the payment of the $10,000 influenced the Court\u2019s decision. Several other cases have addressed the issue of whether a season ticket holder\nhas a \u201cright\u201d to renew season tickets. The context of these cases is that the team, for\none reason or another, refused to renew the tickets of a season ticket holder, and the\nholder filed suit. Generally, these cases have held that there is no \u201cright\u201d to renew\nseason tickets. See Charpentier v. Los Angeles Rams Football Co., 75 Cal.App.4th\n301, 89 Cal. Rptr.2d 115 (1999) (affirming dismissal of an implied contract claim against\nthe Rams alleging a right to renewal, while stating in dicta that some renewal right might\nbe subject of implied contract but no fan could reasonably expect right to renew season\ntickets when team moved halfway across country); Soderholm v. Chicago Natl. League\nBall Club, Inc., 225 Ill. App.3d 119, 124, 167 Ill.Dec. 248, 587 N.E.2d 517 (1992), appeal\ndenied 145 Ill.2d 644, 596 N.E.2d 637, 173 Ill.Dec. 13 (1992) (Chicago Cubs season\nticket renewal canceled for scalping, no right to renew); Yarde Metals, Inc. v. New\nEngland Patriots Ltd. Partnership, 64 Mass. App.Ct. 656, 834 N.E.2d 1233\nMass.App.Ct.,2005) (New England Patriot season ticket renewal cancelled for rowdy\nbehavior, no right to renew); Kully v. Goldman, 208 Neb. 760, 305 N.W.2d 800 (1981)\n( GL-148771-08 4 (Nebraska Cornhusker season ticket renewal not a property right); But see, Beder v.\nCleveland Browns, Inc., 129 Ohio App.3d 188, 195, 717 N.E.2d 716 (1998), appeal\ndenied 84 Ohio St.3d 1438, 702 N.E.2d 1215 (1998) (season ticket holders had\npurchased a right of first refusal to tickets to Browns' games; the Browns had destroyed\nthat right by moving their team to Baltimore). There does seem to be an apparent conflict in these cases. For example, it is\ndifficult to reconcile the 10th Circuit opinion in Harrell with the Bankruptcy opinion in\nCraig. Part of the difference in the cases can be attributed to state law. For example,\nPennsylvania law seems to favor transfers of rights such as these. For example the\nCraig court cited In re Nejberger, 934 F.2d 1300 (3d Cir. 1991), which found a property\ninterest in a liquor license allowed a trustee to transfer a Pennsylvania liquor license). Nejberger was relied on to find that there is a transferable right by the Bankruptcy court\nin Craig. In contrast, the Harrell decision denied the existence of a right based on the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of Arizona law. However, there does not seem to be a\ngreat deal of difference in the laws of other states on this point.",

    "text": "POSTF-123043-08 14 by the agreement constituted employment as defined in section 1426 of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1939 [section 3121]. Thus, when states signed on to social security coverage, they contractually agreed to\npay the equivalent of FICA taxes (\u201csocial security contributions\u201d) with respect to\nemployees within coverage groups. As a result of this contract relationship with the state, the state had primary liability for\nsocial security contributions rather than the employing entity. If SSA established an\nunderpayment of social security contributions under a section 218 agreement, the state\nwas the party liable under the contract, not the governmental entity employing the\nindividual. The Administrator of SSA was empowered to exercise discretion to deduct\nunpaid contributions and interest from any payment due to the state under the Social\nSecurity Act. See section 218(j) of the Social Security Act prior to repeal in 1986. In\n1978, only the state, and not the employing governmental entities or the individual\nworkers, had standing to bring suit against SSA for overpayment of section 218\ncontributions. See section 218(a) prior to its 1986 amendment. This scheme of social\nsecurity contributions under a section 218 agreement was completely at odds with the\nfocus of section 530 on an individual employing entity's entitlement to relief based on a\nreasonable basis. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Public Law 99-509, amended the\nSocial Security Act and the Code to provide that payments for coverage under section\n218 agreements were FICA taxes. Section 3121(b)(7)(E) was added to the Code to\nprovide that \u201cemployment\u201d includes service included under an agreement entered into\npursuant to section 218 of the Social Security Act. In addition the definition of\n\u201cemployee\u201d under section 3121(d) was expanded by adding section 3121(d)(4), which\nprovides that the term \u201cemployee\u201d includes any individual who performs services that\nare included under an agreement entered into pursuant to section 218 of the Social\nSecurity Act. The cumulative effect of these amendments is that individuals who are\ncovered under section 218 agreements are automatically treated as employees\nperforming employment for FICA tax purposes, as is discussed above at 2.a. The premise of section 530 is that, with respect to the employer's liability for federal\nemployment taxes, an individual will not be treated as an employee despite his or her\nstatus as an employee11. The classification of state and local employees as employees\nunder section 3121(d)(4) is made specifically with reference to section 218 of the Social\nSecurity Act. If the individual is covered under a section 218 agreement, he or she is, by\ndefinition, an employee for FICA purposes. The determination of whether an individual\nis covered under a section 218 agreement is made by the Social Security Administrator\nand the Social Security Administration under section 210(j) of the Social Security Act. Section 530 relief for FICA taxes is inappropriate, because coverage under the section\n218 agreement is dispositive of the individual's FICA tax status. 11 Section 530 has since been modified to provide that application of section 530 is not dependent upon a\nfinding that the individual is otherwise an employee. See Section 530(e)(3). POSTF-123043-08 15",
