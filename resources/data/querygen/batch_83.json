    "text": "NAIC Proc.\n1991-2, page 60; 1994-4, page 85. Meanwhile on the Congressional level the\nChairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Committee on POSTU-144536-09 14 Governmental Affairs, requested the General Accounting Office to study the BCBS\nplans and the BCBS Association. In 1994 the GAO issued a report, Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield: Experiences of Weak Plans Underscore the Role of Effective State\nOversight, GAO/HEHS-94-71 (April 1994). The 1994 GAO report reflected the lack of\nunderstanding about the internal arrangements of BCBS plans at that time: The revelation that several Blues plans were in poor financial condition prompted\nfundamental questions about all Blues plans because of the large number of\nAmericans they insure. Are the plans run by a single corporate headquarters, or\ndo they each operate as an independent business? How do Blues plans differ\nfrom commercial health insurers? How many Blues plans are in financial trouble\nand why? What are the responsibilities of the Blues Association when plans\nhave financial problems? [Id. at 2.] The NAIC Special Committee on Blue Cross Plans found that the organization\nand regulation of BCBS plans varied significantly from state to state. In many states,\nBCBS plans were not subject to the general laws and regulations governing commercial\ninsurers. The special statutes governing BCBS plans differed considerably, especially\nin the areas of financial standards and the level of regulatory authority provided to\nregulators. NAIC Proc. 1993-1, page 152. Similarly, the 1994 GAO report found that\n\"Blues plans differ considerably in organization, operations, and regulation.\" 1994 GAO\nReport, p 34. In December, 1994, the NAIC Special Committee on Blue Cross Plans issued its\nfinal report. During this same period, the NAIC was developing \"risk-based capital\"\n(RBC) standards for insurance companies. The NAIC Special Committee on Blue\nCross Plans considered risk-based capital standards for BCBS plans but recommended\nthat the standards should be developed by the specific subcommittee that was working\non risk-based capital initiatives. NAIC Proc. 1992-2, page 160, 1993-3, page 11. In its\nfinal report the Special Committee on Blue Cross Plans repeated its recommendation\nthat \"development of risk-based capital standards for health carriers specifically include\nstandards for Blue Plans\" and noted that the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association had\nbeen developing its own risk-based capital mechanisms in order to monitor its\nmembers. NAIC Proc. 1994-4, p 85. The final report indicated the Committee had reviewed how BCBS national\naccounts are handled, noting that a written description of these programs had been\nprovided by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. The final report indicated that the Committee had considered recommending the\ndevelopment of a separate Annual Statement form for BCBS plans but instead a\n\"Financial Reporting Working Group\" was formed which developed \"financial reporting\nsupplements and instructions\" for obtaining additional information from Blue Cross/Blue\nShield Plans. Id. at 85, 86. The Working Group indicated that \"The supplement was\nlargely modeled after filings already required of Plans, primarily internal filings required POSTU-144536-09 15 of Plans by the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association.\" NAIC Proc. 1994-4, page 86. The\nsupplement had three parts:\n1. Statement of Operations By Line of Business - Statutory Basis\n2. Non-Underwritten Health Benefit Programs - Benefit Payments 3. Interrogatory",

Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule\n3, line 2). 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part\nIII). 5. Earned income credit (line 27). No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed\nbased on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can\nclaim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term \"parent\" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual. \u2022 If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is\ntreated as the qualifying child of the parent. \u2022 If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the\nchild as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying\nchild of the parents. \u2022 If the parents don\u2019t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the\nchild as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child\nlived for the longer period of time in 2022. If the child lived\nwith each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat\nthe child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022. \u2022 If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the\nchild is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the\nhighest AGI for 2022. \u2022 If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no\nparent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but\nonly if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any\nparent of the child who can claim the child. Example. Your child, J meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of\nthose five tax benefits based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s\nAGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying\nchild, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 501. If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to\nStep 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't claim any benefits based on\nthis child. Social security number. You must enter each dependent's social security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered\nagree with the dependent's social security card.",

    "text": "Additionally, the Tax Court has also held that when a spouse\nraises a claim for relief under I.R.C. \u00a7 6015 in any judicial\nproceeding before the Tax Court, and the other spouse is not a\nparty to the case, the IRS must notify the nonpetitioning spouse of\nhis or her right to intervene. King v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 118\n(2000). In this case, however, petitioner --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------was already party when petitioner\n------raised the claim for relief under I.R.C. \u00a7 6015 in the Tax\nCourt proceeding. Thus, respondent was not required under I.R.C.\n\u00a7 6015 to notify - of --\u2019s claim for relief and -\u2019s right to\nintervene in --\u2019s case. The fact the counsel for ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------did not object to the\nseverance of --\u2019s case or assert -\u2019s right to participate --------------\u2019s determination of relief does not create a responsibility\non respondent to notify - of his right to become a party to the\ncase again. Note that in this case Mr. -- had actual knowledge of ----------------'s innocent spouse proceeding and was a party to that\nproceeding as he jointly petitioned. Also, - was at all times\nrepresented by counsel. If the Estate of -----wishes to challenge the Tax Court's\ngrant of innocent spouse relief to -----, then the Estate must either move for reconsideration of the decision in ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'s case or move to\nvacate the decision; either such motion would have to be filed in\nthe Tax Court. Based upon the discussion above, it is unlikely\nthat the Tax Court would reconsider or vacate its decision in -------------'s case. The probate court lacks jurisdiction to override or overrule\nthe Tax Court's judgment in -----'s case. The United States Courts\nof Appeal have exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the\nTax Court. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). The probate court is required\nunder principles of comity and federalism to honor the judgment of\nthe Tax Court. (Judicial comity is \"[t]he respect a court of one\nstate or jurisdiction shows to another state or jurisdiction in\ngiving effect to the other's laws and judicial decisions.\" Black's\nLaw Dictionary 262 (7th ed. 1999).) If, nonetheless, the probate court were to assert jurisdiction\nand rule that ------is jointly and severally liable with -----------for the - through - income tax deficiencies, the Internal\nRevenue Service could not collect from -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------individually. This is so because the\nTax Court relieved her of liability, and the Service is bound by\nthe Tax Court's decision. The Internal Revenue Service could,\nhowever, collect from ----- as transferee of assets from ----------'s estate. And, of course, the Estate of --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------is liable for the full amount of\nthe deficiencies regardless of whether ------is or is not relieved\nof liability.

In the present case, ----------------------------took the right to the use of ------\u2019s real property for a\nperiod of ----months. ----------------------------compensated ------ for the right to use the property,\nnot for a fee interest in property. Therefore, it follows that these payments received by -----were in the nature of rent. -------contends that Rev. Rul. 83-70, 1983-1 C.B. 189, is authority for its position that the\nproceeds it received were received in connection with an involuntary conversion. In Rev. Rul.\n83-70, the Service ruled that a fee interest in real property acquired by a taxpayer with\ncondemnation proceeds constituted \u201cproperty similar or related in service or use\u201d to a 15-year\nleasehold interest that had been involuntarily converted. The taxpayer had leased property that\nit used in its furniture storage business with a 15-year term remaining on the lease at the time of\nthe taking. The taxpayer had no options to renew the lease. The taxpayer acquired a fee\nsimple interest in property to use in its business and was allowed nonrecognition treatment. Rev, Rul. 83-70 is distinguishable from the present case. In Rev. Rul. 83-70, the taxpayer\u2019s\nentire interest (its 15-year leasehold interest) was taken. Thus, the taking constituted a final\ndisposition of the taxpayer\u2019s property. The taking was not a lease or sublease of the property. In contrast, in the taking at issue in the present case, ----------------------------took the ----------------------------and the ----------------for only ----months and -------retained a continuing fee interest in\nboth properties. The taking did not affect ------\u2019s right to develop the properties after the\nexpiration of the ----month taking period or to realize capital appreciation on the properties both\nduring and after the ----month period. Therefore, ----------------------------- temporary taking of the\n----------------------------and the ----------------does not qualify as an involuntary conversion\ndescribed in I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a).
