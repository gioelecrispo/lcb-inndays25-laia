    "text": "The first and second\nalternatives are the ones most commonly used by members. Basis and hedge-to-arrive\ncontracts are less common. Coop offers different alternatives to accommodate the desire of many members who POSTF-143023-10 8 want to retain as much flexibility as possible to determine when and how to sell their b. The alternatives that Coop offers are similar to the choices offered farmers by\ncommercial b companies, though of course, commercial b companies do not market b\non a patronage basis and pay patronage dividends. One way to sell b to Coop for marketing on a patronage basis is to sell the b to Coop in\na spot sale at the bid price. All country elevators have posted bid prices. The cash bid\nprices vary from day to day. The variations are in response to developments in the b\nmarkets (and future exchanges). Those markets are very active. Cash bid prices also\nvary during each day. It is usually not advantageous for farmers to simply deliver b to sell it at the posted cash\nbid prices at the time of harvest since prices normally are lowest at the time. Some\nfarmers have the capacity to store b on their farms and can deliver the b later when they\nbelieve the price is right. Many farmers deliver b to an elevator for storage (and pay the\nelevator storage fees), retaining ownership of the b until they believe the bid price is\nright. The most popular way for members to sell their b to Coop is by forward contract\n(sometimes also referred to as a \u201cto arrive\u201d contract). Forward contract calls for a\ndelivery of a specified quantity and quality of b, at a specified location, during a\nspecified time period. Forward contracts also specify the price that is to be paid for the\nb. Forward contracts can be entered into before b is planted or while it is growing. Farmers interested in entering into a forward contract with Coop can determine the price\nCoop is willing to pay at its various elevators during various periods of time in the future\nfrom Coop's cash b bid schedule. When a b company purchases b from a member\npursuant to a forward contract, ownership of the b passes to the company at the time of\ndelivery under the contract and ordinarily payment is then due. A farmer can contract to sell his b to Coop at the time of harvest (or at some other time)\nunder a basis contract. These contracts are sometimes used by Coop and its members,\nbut are not as popular as forward contracts and selling b in spot sales. Basis contracts allow a farmer, who believes that the future price of b will increase in the\nmonths after he or she enters into the contract, to defer setting the cash price until a\nlater date. Contracts governing these arrangements specify the shipment period and\ntime period during which the farmer has the option of asking that his or her b be priced.",

An additional potential issue has arisen based upon\nthe document review. This question deals with whether\nCorporation entered in to a valid binding written contract as of\nDecember 31, 1996, to construct the subject synfuel facilities. It is duly noted that the taxpayers have each received PLRs\nstating that the Execution Date contract is a qualified binding\nwritten contract. Nevertheless, a review of the subject\ncontract discovered that the parties, per the terms of the\ncontract, were not bound until -----------------------------------------------------------------------. To our knowledge, ---------------------------------------------pursuant to this\ncontract until Year. It is also noted that the facility described in the\nagreement for the construction of d Facilities is not the\nfacility ultimately constructed. The main difference is that\nthe contract called for material handling/control components\nwhich would have allowed for the Process. These facilities were\nnever constructed. The contract rights to bc of the Facilities were sold to\nanother taxpayer. Of the remaining Facilities that it\ncontracted for, Corporation had bd constructed. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n1. In general, section 29 provides a credit for the\nproduction of solid synthetic fuel from coal. Section 29(g)(1)\nprovides a tax credit for the sale of qualified fuels that are\nsold through the end of 2007 and produced from a facility that\nwas originally placed in service after December 31, 1992, and CC:LM:NR:----Page 19\nbefore July 1, 1998, pursuant to a binding written contract that\nwas in effect before January 1, 1997. No regulations have been\npromulgated under section 29. Thus, we look to other published\nguidance of the Service and other analogous Code sections to\ninterpret the meaning and scope of that section, in particular\nthe meaning of placed in service. In general, property is placed in service in the taxable\nyear the property is placed in a condition or state of readiness\nand availability for a specifically designed function. See,\nTreas. Reg. sections 1.46-3(d)(1)(ii) and 1.167(a)-11(e)(1)(i). Placed in service is construed as having the same meaning for\npurposes of the investment tax credit under section 46 and\ndepreciation under section 167, in Rev. Proc. 2001-30, 2001-1\nC.B. 1163 and in private letter rulings. Section 1.46-3(d)(2)\nprovides examples of when property is in a condition of\nreadiness and availability. One of those examples is equipment\nthat is acquired for a specifically assigned function and is\noperational but undergoing tests to eliminate any defects.",
