    "text": "The fact that the expenses of five1\nfamily members who travelled on the expedition were not deducted on the corporate return\nsuggests that the expedition was primarily a family recreational event and not primarily\nbusiness-related. The Regulations under \u00a7 162 envision three types of travel: (1) \u201cSolely on business,\u201d in\nwhich case all reasonable and necessary travel expenses, including meals and lodging, are\ndeductible (Reg. \u00a7 1.162-2(a)); (2) travel that mixes personal and business, in which case\nthe expenses of travel to the destination are deductible if the trip is \u201cprimarily\u201d for business\n(Reg.\n\u00a7 1.162-2(b)(1)); and (3) travel \u201cprimarily personal in nature\u201d, in which case the\n\u201ctraveling expenses to and from the destination are not deductible even though the\ntaxpayer engages in business activities while at such destination\u201d but \u201cexpenses while at\nthe destination which are properly allocable to the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business are\ndeductible\u201d (Reg. \u00a7 1.162-2(b)(1)). In your examination the *** al expedition appears to be\nprimarily personal. The company has not established (and cannot establish) that any part\nof the expenses are business, because the only potentially business-related activity would\nbe advertising-related which (as explained above) is too insufficient to qualify as ordinary\nand necessary. As we do not believe the expenditures qualify under \u00a7 162, we do not reach the issue\nof whether they would be capitalized and amortized (rather than deducted currently) as\ndiscussed in Reg. \u00a7 1.162-20(a). Neither are the expenses deductible as a charitable contribution. Although a small --------------- documenting the *** al -------------- was placed in the taxpayer\u2019s ------------, that ------------------- is not a tax-exempt entity as defined in I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 170 and 501(c)(3). In\nconnection with the *** al --------------, no cash or other thing of value was transferred to a\ntax-exempt entity, nor did the company pay any expenses that were the legal obligation of\na tax-exempt entity. A charitable contribution deduction is thus not an appropriate\nalternative. As you have noted, the Service examined this taxpayer in previous years and did not\ndisallow deductions arising from a previous --------- (in -------) for the -------------------------------------------. We note that, as a matter of law, the Service is not required to treat a taxpayer\nconsistently from year to year; the fact that the Service allows a deduction in one year does\nnot bar the Service from disallowing a similar deduction in a later year. Each year stands\non its own. United States v. Skelly Oil Co., 394 U.S. 678, 684 (1969); Knights of Columbus\nCouncil #3660 v. United States, 783 F.2d 69 (7th Cir 1986); Rose v. Commissioner, 55 T.C.\n28, 32 (1970); Rooney v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2011-14. Even if justification were\nneeded for treating the two years differently, there may be factual distinctions between the\n1 *** am, *** at, *** an, *** ao, and *** ap. CC:LM:RFPH:CHI:2:M:POSTF-130690-11 Page 10 two --------------- which justify the deduction of one but not the other. For example, the\nearlier -------------- is included in the ------*** v which may be of legitimate advertising value;\nthe second -------------- took place after the making of the ----- and does not appear to have\nbeen given any significant exposure to the public.",

    "text": "ISSUE\nShould the Service consider asserting the section 6694\npenalty against Preparer for advising the Taxpayer to make an\nimpermissible section 280C(c)(3) election on a refund claim? CONCLUSION Since Preparer is a \u201creturn preparer\u201d who advised the\nTaxpayer to take a frivolous position (i.e., to make a section\n280C(c)(3) election, for the first time, on a refund claim\n) that resulted in a tax\nunderstatement, the Service should consider the asserting the\nsection 6694 penalty against Preparer. APPLICABLE LAW\nA. Sections 41, 174 and 280C Section 41 allows taxpayers a credit against tax for\nincreasing research activities. Generally, the credit is an\nincremental credit equal to the sum of 20 percent of the excess\n(if any) of the taxpayer's QREs for the taxable year over the\nbase amount, and 20 percent of the taxpayer's basic research\npayments determined under section 41(e)(1)(A).2 Section 174(a)\nprovides that a taxpayer may treat research or experimental\nexpenditures that are paid or incurred during the taxable year in\nconnection with the taxpayer's trade or business as expenses not\nchargeable to capital account. Section 280C(c)(1) requires taxpayers to reduce the amount\nof QREs otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 174 by\nan amount equal to the research credit determined under section\n41(a). However, section 280C(c)(3) allows a taxpayer to make an\nelection that will allow it to avoid the reduction of the section 2 Under section 41(c)(2), however, the minimum base amount\nis 50 percent of the credit year QREs. CC:LM:F:MAN:POSTU-162762-02 page 4 174 expenditures. Specifically, a proper section 280C(c)(3)\nelection enables a taxpayer to avoid the reduction of section 174\nexpenses by claiming a reduced research credit generally equal to\n13 percent of the excess of a taxpayer's QREs for the taxable\nyear over the base amount. I.R.C. \u00a7 280C(c)(3)(B).\nSection 280C(c)(3)(C) specifically provides that the section\n280C(c)(3) election shall be made not later than the time for\nfiling the return of tax for such year (including extensions),\nshall be made on such return, and shall be made in such manner as\nthe Secretary may prescribe. This rule is repeated in Treasury\nRegulation \u00a7 1.280C-4(a), which states \u201c[t]he election under\nsection 280C(c)(3) to have the provisions of section 280C(c)(1)\nand (2) not apply shall be made by claiming the reduced credit\nunder section 41(a) determined by the method provided in section\n280C(c)(3)(B) on an original return for the taxable year, filed\nat any time on or before the due date (including extensions) for\nfiling the income tax return for such year.\u201d (Emphasis added). B. Section 6694\ni. General Rules Section 6694(a) and (b) impose penalties on income tax\nreturn preparers for certain understatements of liability on a\nreturn or claim for refund. An \u201cincome tax return preparer\u201d is a\nperson who prepares, for compensation, any return of tax imposed\nby subtitle A (income taxes) or any claim for refund of taxes\nimposed by subtitle A. A person who does not physically prepare\nan income tax return is considered a preparer if that person\nfurnishes a taxpayer sufficient information and advice so that\ncompletion of the return or claim for refund is largely a\nmechanical matter.

See Center\nfor Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Dept. of Health and Human\nServices, Guidance for Industry, 180-Day Exclusivity When Multiple ANDAs Are Submitted on the Same\nDay (July, 2003). 63 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(2010) provides that approvals can be made effective subject to conditions;\nhowever, the statute also provides that the FDA can send tentative approval letters. The FDA\u2019s POSTU-139175-10 58 ANDA filings.64 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(2010). The 180 days of exclusivity is\nvaluable to the generic drug producer. The article by David E. Korn, Erika Lietzan and\nShaw W. Scott (cited above) addresses multiple views of the value of the 180-day\nexclusivity,65 with one view stated as follows: 66 interpretation of the definition of tentative approval letters may limit the use of tentative approval letters to\nsituations where the exclusivity period is relative to the NDA-approved drugs (e.g., new innovative\npediatric drug exclusivity or new innovative drug for rare condition exclusivity - periods of exclusivity that\ncan apply after the patents expire and are cross referenced in the statute provision defining tentative\napproval), not the 180-day exclusivity of the first applicant. Tentative Approval. If a generic drug product is ready for approval before the\nexpiration of any patents or exclusivities accorded to the reference listed drug\nproduct, FDA issues a tentative approval letter to the applicant. The tentative\napproval letter details the circumstances associated with the tentative approval. FDA delays final approval of the generic drug product until all patent or\nexclusivity issues have been resolved. A tentative approval does not allow the\napplicant to market the generic drug product. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Glossary of Terms,\nwww.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm079436.htm (last visited on 8/16/2011)(emphasis added). The article by Erika Lietzan and David E. Korn, Issues in the Interpretation of 180-Day Exclusivity, 62\nFood & Drug L.J. 49, 50 (2007) may interpret the language in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 505(j)(5)(B)(iv) as barring FDA\napproval (even tentative) if a prior ANDA filer may be a first applicant entitled to 180-days of exclusivity.
