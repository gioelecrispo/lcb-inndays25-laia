In the present case, -- purpose in acquiring -- is that,\ncombined, - and -- can be run more efficiently and can use its\ncapital more profitably than either company on its own, thus\ncreating substantial long-term value. See Form 886-A. Thus the\nexpenses in question, since directly related to seeking the longterm value, should be capitalized. 7\n7 It is possible, though not likely, that among these expenses some are\nordinary and necessary in nature and the long-term benefit they generated is\nonly incidental. In that situation, as the INDOPCO Court states, such\nordinary and necessary expenses should be allowed as currently deductible. However, it is the taxpayer that has the burden to establish that the\nexpenses should be currently deductible rather than capitalized. INDOPCO\nInc. v. Commissioner, 503 U.S. 79, 85 (1992).

Accordingly, under INDOPCO, these expenses must be capitalized. This conclusion is consistent with the Service\u2019s Proposed\nRegulations for \u00a7 263. Under these Proposed Regulations,\nregardless when it is paid, an amount that is inherently\nfacilitative to an acquisition should be capitalized. See Prop.\nTreas.

An amount is inherently facilitative if it is paid for\nactivities performed in determining the value of the\ntarget, negotiations or structuring the transaction,\npreparing and reviewing transactional documents,\npreparing and reviewing regulatory filings required by\nthe transaction, obtaining regulatory approval of the\ntransaction, securing advice on the tax consequences of\nthe transaction, obtaining shareholder approval of the\ntransaction, or conveying property between the parties\nto the transaction.

    "text": "Tate & Lyle, 87 F.3d at 104. It was\nto avoid this result, which Congress viewed as \u201cunduly harsh,\u201d that the Secretary was\nauthorized to address, by regulation, amounts owed to foreign payees. But the statute\ncertainly does not specify whether the Secretary was to apply the matching principle by,\nas taxpayer suggests, allowing payees in its situation an immediate deduction when\ninterest is accrued, or, as the Secretary determined in the Treasury Regulation, allowing\na deduction only when the interest is paid. Moreover, the assumption underlying taxpayer\u2019s argument, that because the\ninterest income is exempt from tax by treaty, there is nothing to match against, is\nmistaken. As Judge Gerber explained in his Tax Court dissent in Tate & Lyle, 103 T.C. POSTF-108700-08 13 at 683\u2013684, \u201cCongress did not relieve taxpayers from the requirements of section 267\nwhere one of the related members is tax-exempt under section 501,\u201d and it thus \u201cdoes\nnot follow that, if an entity is exempt from tax and the related entities are subject to\nsection 267, an otherwise taxable entity that is exempt from some portion of its income,\nespecially under a treaty, would result in the related entities\u2019 not being subject to section\n267.\u201d As Judge Gerber further explained, \u201cit does not follow that\u2014because the income\nis tax-exempt, it is or becomes nonexistent for purposes of the accounting method\nrequirements of sections 881(a)(1), 1442(a), and 267. The character of income is not\nchanged simply because a treaty provides relief from part or all of the tax of one of the\ntreaty countries. Rather, the [treaty] simply has the effect of eliminating the U.S. tax.\u201d 103 T.C. at 684. In sum, as the Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle observed, \u201c[t]he legislative history of\nsection 267(a)(3) reveals that Congress anticipated other reasons [than a difference in\naccounting methods] for the mismatch of interest expense and income between related\npersons, which would defer the deduction of interest expense until actually paid.\u201d 87\nF.3d at 105. Instead, as the Tax Court in Square D explained, \u201cthe scope of the\nregulations under Section 267(a)(3) is generally determined by the presence or absence\nof a U.S. method of accounting for the income in the hands of the foreign recipient,\nwhere the U.S. payor seeks to accrue a deduction with respect to that item.\u201d Square D,\n118 T.C. 299 at *312. Both the Senate and the House reports on I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3)\nmake clear, as the Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle observed, 87 F.3d at 105, that Congress\ncontemplated that the Commissioner might combat such abuse by applying I.R.C. \u00a7\n267(a)(3) to situations where the payee was not ultimately subject to tax on the amount\nreceived. In Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.267(a)\u20133, the Secretary did no more than what the House\nand Senate reports said he could do. The Secretary adopted a rule providing that\nwhere an accrual basis United States taxpayer accrues interest payable to a related\nforeign payee, the United States taxpayer is allowed a deduction only when the interest\nis paid. Therefore, as found by the Seventh Circuit, the Third Circuit and the Tax Court,\nthe regulation is based on a permissible construction of the statute and should be\nupheld. III.",

In the absence of persuasive corroborating evidence,\nthe Commissioner is not required to accept the self-serving\ntestimony of interested parties. Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of\nU.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 512 (1984). In this case,\nhas not provided any detailed\nproof that the expatriate employees performed specific activities\ndirectly for its benefit. It has relied entirely on generalized\nstatements as to what the overall benefits were. Therefore, we\ndo not believe\ncould meet its burden of proof and\nestablish that it is entitled to deduct any part of the exercised\nstock options as its own expense. Nonetheless, we will analyze\nwhether\ngeneralized argument would meet the\n\u201cdirect and proximate benefit\u201d exception. 1 We note that this \u201cunique and compelling circumstances\u201d\ndoctrine is a judicially developed rule that has no specific\nsupport in the statute, the regulations, or the legislative\nhistory of section 162. The courts have sporadically applied the\ndoctrine, and no definitive set of criteria for invoking the\ndoctrine has emerged from the case law. CC:LM:F:MAN:1:POSTF-112619-02 page 6 First Argument Awarded Stock Options to the\nExpatriate Employees for Increasing\nRoyalty\nIncome\nA parent may claim a 162 deduction for compensation it paid\nto employees working abroad at its foreign subsidiaries if the\nparent proves that the specific services rendered by each of the\nemployees were performed for the parent\u2019s direct and proximate\nbenefit. Young & Rubicam, 410 F.2d at 1238-39; Columbian Rope, 42\nT.C. at 815-16. The general and indirect benefit which obviously\ninures to a parent corporation when one of its subsidiaries\nsuccessfully performs its functions does not satisfy the\nrequirements of section 162. Young & Rubicam, 410 F.2d at 123839; Columbian Rope, 42 T.C. at 815-16. Moreover, a parent cannot\nclaim as its own expense, compensation paid for activities\nconnected with the day-to-day operation of the subsidiary\u2019s\nbusiness. Young & Rubicam, 410 F.2d at 1239; Columbian Rope, 42\nT.C. at 815-16. Any benefit to the parent from these activities\ncannot be considered proximate and direct to its own business,\nand therefore, these expenses are not allowable deductions under\nsection 162. Young & Rubicam, 410 F.2d at 1238-39; Columbian\nRope, 42 T.C. at 815-16. Thus, a parent ordinarily may not\ndeduct compensation paid by it to the employees of its wholly\nowned subsidiary, even though the indirect benefit of their\nservices inures to the parent as sole shareholder of the\nemployer. Young & Rubicam, 410 F.2d at 1238-39; Columbian Rope,\n42 T.C. at 815-16. However, where an employee performed services\nproximately and directly benefitting both the parent and the\nsubsidiary, a reasonable allocation to determine the parent\u2019s\ndeduction should be made. Young & Rubicam, 410 F.2d at 1238-39;\nColumbian Rope, 42 T.C. at 815-16. Again,\nhas not\npresented any contemporaneous evidence that such an allocation\nshould be made nor how this allocation was made. claims that the direct benefit it received\nfrom the rendered services was an increase in both royalty income\nearned from its subsidiaries and the sales of\nto its subsidiaries.

    "text": "[citations omitted.] As the court stated in Mathes v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1990-483,\nSection 162(a) is not a carte blanche grant by the Government for the right\nto deduct all expenses which arguably are somewhat related to an incomeproducing activity, no matter how unreasonable in amount. The element of\nreasonableness is inherent in the phrase \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d . . .\nwhether the amount of the deduction claimed is reasonable is determined\nunder the facts and circumstances of each case. The burden of proving that\nsuch amounts are reasonable rests with petitioner. In determining whether\nthe amount expended is reasonable, the amount of the expenditure has\nbeen compared with the benefit to be derived. [citations omitted.] Admittedly, it is not for the Service to decide whether a taxpayer\u2019s expenditure is the\nbest possible use of the company\u2019s funds, only whether it was ordinary and necessary in\npursuit of the business. Expenditures for advertising are deductible whether or not the\nadvertising is effective; they are even deductible if the advertising completely misfires and\nhas disastrous results for the company\u2019s sales and reputation. The deduction depends\nprimarily on whether the expenditure, at the time it was authorized, \u201cmight reasonably be\nexpected to produce some patronage benefit.\u201d On the other hand, the expenditure cannot\nhave merely a remote or tangential connection with promoting the company; and the\nexpense must be reasonable in amount compared to the reasonably expected benefits. Extravagant expenditures from which a reasonable person could expect only minimal\nbenefits are not deductible. As the court stated in Helstoski v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1990-382: We do not intend to suggest that we should, as a matter of course, secondguess taxpayers' business decisions or restrict taxpayers to deduction of\nonly the least expensive method of conducting their businesses. Nevertheless, when the individuals involved are major owners and ranking\nofficers of the business in question, and when the issue is whether the travel\nexpenses were primarily the personal expenses of those controlling\nindividuals or primarily business expenses, one factor that may bear upon\nthat issue is whether there are less expensive alternatives that would have\nbeen practical ways to conduct the business activities without so much, or\nso costly, travel. In your examination, the taxpayer has not demonstrated that the *** al -------------- was\nintended to benefit the reputation or increase the sales of the corporation. It has not\ndemonstrated that the results of the -------------- were disclosed to customers or potential CC:LM:RFPH:CHI:2:M:POSTF-130690-11 Page 8 customers (or were intended to be so disclosed) in any manner beyond the -----------exhibit, public report, and perhaps some other minimal publications. It has not proven that\nthe large expenses of the -------------- were reasonable in relation to the corporate benefits\nthat could reasonably be expected. We note also that, even if it could be established that the -------------- improved the\nreputation and goodwill of the *** ah family, such an accomplishment is not necessarily a\npromotion of the corporation itself and thus not deductible by the corporation. Brown v.\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 1970-253. Only the promotion of the company and its products\nqualify for deduction under \u00a7 162(a).",

    "text": "What this opinion does is recognize that a necessary element of this definition\nis a mutual agreement between the Coop and the member/patron that the b purchase\nprice will be treated as a per-unit retain before it can be so classified. The Code\ndefinition reads, as follows:\n(f) Per-unit retains allocation. For purposes of this subchapter, the term \u201cper-unit retain allocation\u201d\nmeans any allocation, by an organization to which part I of this subchapter applies, to a\npatron with respect to products marketed for him, the amount of which is fixed without POSTF-143023-10 15 reference to the net earnings of the organization pursuant to an agreement between\nthe organization and the patron. [Emphasis added]. Per-unit retains are unique; they are different from closed sale proceeds. At the inception, one must recognize the difficulty presented by the fact that,\nalmost any payment made in money to a member or a participating patron for\ncommodities that the Coop markets may be made to fit within the definition of a per-unit\nretain allocation for tax purposes, namely, as allocations, made to patrons, being fixed\nwith reference to the products being marketed for the patron, and without reference to\nthe net earnings of the cooperative. See, Farm Service Coop. v. Commissioner, 619\nF.2d 718 (8th Cir. 1980), rev\u2019g 70 T.C. 145 (1978). However, as this opinion attempts to\nclarify, this does not mean that closed purchase price proceeds and per-unit retains are\none and the same. The distinction between the two is not clean, but there is a distinction\nto be drawn. Conceptually, in the case of per unit retains, the Coop is marketing the\ncommodity on behalf of the patron and gives back some of the patron\u2019s equity (an\n\u201cadvance\u201d in lieu of an eventual potential patronage dividend). In the case of a closed b\nsale/purchase transaction, the patron already received his/her equity in the commodity,\nas his/her b selling price. The blurring of the distinction between the two occurs because\nthe patron in a closed sale/purchase transaction will also benefit from any patronage\ndividend that may be declared and this benefit is proportional to the amount of business\nthat it does with the cooperative. Despite the blurring of the two concepts, we are of the\nopinion, that closed purchases and per unit retains paid in money remain distinct\nconcepts. Per-unit retains can be distributed in money, certificates, or other property. I.R.C.\n\u00a7\u00a71382(b)(3)-(4). Per-unit-retains paid in money serve a very specific need: They are\nused to make cash payments to members or participating patrons before the profit from\nthe coop\u2019s marketing of the member\u2019s or participating patron\u2019s commodity can be\ndetermined. A typical situation would occur where the cooperative uses commodity pools. The\nprofit (loss) from the pool is shared by the members (participating patrons) of the\nmarketing cooperative. The profit (loss) from the pool can not be determined until the\npool is closed; at that time, pool sale proceeds and associated expenses will be known.",
