The tax compliance check will be\nlimited to an inquiry regarding whether an applicant\nhas filed all required individual or business tax\nreturns and whether the applicant has failed to pay, or\nmake proper arrangements with the Internal Revenue\nService for payment of, any Federal tax debts. The suitability check will be limited to an inquiry\nregarding whether an applicant has engaged in any\nconduct that would justify suspension or disbarment\nof any practitioner under the provisions of this part\non the date the application is submitted, including\nwhether the applicant has engaged in disreputable\nconduct as defined in \u00a710.51. The application will\nbe denied only if the results of the compliance or\nsuitability check are sufficient to establish that the\npractitioner engaged in conduct subject to sanctions\nunder \u00a7\u00a710.51 and 10.52. (2) If the applicant does not pass the tax\ncompliance or suitability check, the applicant will\nnot be issued an enrollment or registration card or\ncertificate pursuant to \u00a710.6(b) of this part.

(e) Temporary recognition. On receipt of a properly\nexecuted application, the Commissioner, or delegate,\nmay grant the applicant temporary recognition to\npractice pending a determination as to whether status\nas an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent,\nor registered tax return preparer should be granted. Temporary recognition will be granted only in\nunusual circumstances and it will not be granted, in\nany circumstance, if the application is not regular on\nits face, if the information stated in the application,\nPage 10 \u2014 \u00a7 10.5 if true, is not sufficient to warrant granting the\napplication to practice, or the Commissioner,\nor delegate, has information indicating that the\nstatements in the application are untrue or that the\napplicant would not otherwise qualify to become\nan enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or\nregistered tax return preparer.

If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a qualiTIP fying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the\nEIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying\nchild. For more information, see Pub. 596. Example. Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the\nfive tax benefits listed here based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s AGI is higher than yours and you don\u2019t claim J as a qualifying child, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 596.

However, if \u201cValid for Work Only With DHS Authorization\u201d is printed on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC purposes only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid. To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number\n(SSN) near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't\nhave an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You\nCan't File on Time? If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of\nyour 2022 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC\non your original or an amended 2022 return.

In summary, it appears that the \"cost-plus\" arrangements that were offered by\nBCBS plans in the early 1990's were underwritten, experience-rated or retrospectivelyrated products, characterized by the issuance of a BCBS card, the use of funds from the\nplan's bank account, and the use of the plan's contractual payment arrangements with\nproviders. The NAIC distinguished these underwritten \"cost-plus\" arrangements from\n\"administrative services only\" arrangements. The NAIC also distinguished underwritten\n\"cost-plus\" arrangements from underwritten and nonunderwritten \"National Accounts POSTU-144536-09 17 arrangements. No type of National Accounts arrangement was ever considered \"costplus.\"\nc. Risk-Based Capital standards. \"Risk-Based Capital\" issues are not unique\nto BCBS organizations and RBC standards were being developed during the same\nperiod that the Special Committee on Blue Cross Plans was conducting its study. As\nnoted above, the Special Committee recommended that the risk-based capital\nstandards that the NAIC was developing for health carriers should specifically include\nstandards for BCBS plans. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association \"observed, with great interest\" the NAIC\nwork on risk-based capital, which \"led BCBSA to create a team to develop a proposed\nformula that could be used by the NAIC as a starting point in developing a health RBC\nformula.\" NAIC Proc. 1993-4, pages 518, 519. In October, 1993, the BCBSA presented\nits proposed formula to the NAIC. The proposal by the BCBSA noted that the NAIC's formula for life and health\ninsurers:\ndoes not specifically consider risk characteristics of large portions of Plans'\nrevenue base (and probably of other health carriers'), including Administrative\nServices Contracts (ASC), Cost-Plus and Federal Employee Health Benefits\nProgram (FEHBP) lines of business. While these lines constitute risk business,\nthe risk to the health entity is less than most other types of prospectively rated\nbusiness because revenue from these products is retrospectively determined. [NAIC Proc., 1993-4 at 519-520.] *** Major characteristics of ASC/Cost-Plus business include: issuance of carrier ID\ncards and membership materials, access to participating providers and\nassociated discounts, if any, conversion coverage rights for subscribers, and\nretrospectively determined revenue. *** To the extent self-funded groups utilizing ASC/Cost-Plus products, are unable to\nfund their claim obligations, the carriers, no longer acting solely as administrators\nas in ASO arrangements, are at risk for fulfilling claims obligations in the event\nthe group is unable to meet its revenue funding obligation. Although ASC/Cost-Plus arrangements are at risk, the carrier's risk is\nsubstantially less than traditional health insurance because the risk of trend\nvariation has been transferred to the group via the retrospectively determined\nrevenue. [Id. at 520.] POSTU-144536-09 18 The BCBSA proposal recommended a separate category for \"ASC/Cost-Plus\", with a\nrisk factor of 0.5%. The BCBSA did not include any category for \"national accounts\"\narrangements and did not show any risk factor for national accounts. Id. at 523. The NAIC continued to work on its RBC standards after the Special Committee\non Blue Cross Plans issued its final report in 1994. The current RBC standards will be\ndiscussed below as part of the response to the Taxpayer's argument.",

Check that both the name and SSN\non your Forms 1040 or 1040-SR, W-2,\nand 1099 agree with your social security\ncard. If they don\u2019t, certain deductions\nand credits on Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nmay be reduced or disallowed and you\nmay not receive credit for your social\nsecurity earnings. If your Form W-2\nshows an incorrect SSN or name, notify\nyour employer or the form-issuing agent\nas soon as possible to make sure your\nearnings are credited to your social security record. If the name or SSN on\nyour social security card is incorrect,\ncall the SSA. Once you are issued an SSN, use it to\nfile your tax return. Use your SSN to file -14- your tax return even if your SSN does\nnot authorize employment or if you have\nbeen issued an SSN that authorizes employment and you lose your employment authorization. An ITIN will not be\nissued to you once you have been issued\nan SSN. If you received your SSN after\npreviously using an ITIN, stop using\nyour ITIN. Use your SSN instead. IRS Individual Taxpayer\nIdentification Numbers\n(ITINs) for Aliens If you are a nonresident or resident alien\nand you don\u2019t have and aren\u2019t eligible to\nget an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN. If you already have an ITIN, enter it\nwherever your SSN is requested on your\ntax return. Some ITINs must be renewed. If you\nhaven't used your ITIN on a federal tax\nreturn at least once for tax years 2019,\n2020, or 2021, it expired at the end of\n2022 and must be renewed if you need\nto file a federal tax return in 2023. You\ndon't need to renew your ITIN if you\ndon't need to file a federal tax return. You can find more information at\nIRS. gov/ITIN. ITINs assigned before 2013\nTIP have expired and must be renewed if you need to file a tax\nreturn in 2023. If you previously submitted a renewal application and it was approved, you do not need to renew again\nunless you haven't used your ITIN on a\nfederal tax return at least once for tax\nyears 2019, 2020, or 2021. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't\nentitle you to social security benefits or\nchange your employment or immigration status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, including application, expiration, and renewal, see Form W-7 and its instructions. If you receive an SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS\noffice or write a letter to the IRS explaining that you now have an SSN and\nwant all your tax records combined under your SSN.
