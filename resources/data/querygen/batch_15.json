Under this\nmethod, a percentage of the total contract revenue is included in\ntaxable income during each year of the contract. 10\nBeginning in Taxable Year1, Taxpayer utilized a Foreign\nSales Corporation (\u201cFSC\u201d), a subsidiary incorporated in CountryZ,\nwith respect to its export sales for U.S. Federal income tax\npurposes, including sales from long-term contracts under both the\nFMS and DCS systems. Taxpayer's U.S. subsidiaries or business\nunits involved in the production of military equipment sold under\nFMS or DCS long-term contracts entered agreements with the FSC\nwhich provided that the FSC would arrange for sales to export\ncustomers. 11\nWhen the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion\nAct of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-519, 114 Stat. 2423 (Nov. 15, 2000)\n(hereinafter \u201cETI Act\") was enacted, Taxpayer sought to apply the\n10 Taxpayer has elected to apply the modified \"10-percent\" method under which\nno income is included until the first year in which 10 percent of the\nestimated total contract costs have been incurred. 11 An example of such an agreement is the ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. CC:LM:HMT:--------:POSTF-103313-03 page 13 ETI rules to income relating to certain long-term contracts which\nwere entered into prior to October 1, 2000 (the general effective\ndate of the 2000 Act). Under the FSC regime, only fifty percent\nof the foreign trading gross receipts (\u201cFTGR\u201d) attributable to\nthe sale of military property was eligible for the partial\nexemption from U.S. income tax provided by sections 923(a)(1) and\n921(a). I.R.C. \u00a7 923(a)(5). This provision, referred to as the\nmilitary property \u201chaircut\u201d, was not retained in the ETI\nexclusion provisions. Reporting its military property sales\nunder the ETI regime, consequently, doubles Taxpayer\u2019s tax\nbenefit in comparison with the benefit available under the FSC\nregime. Only FTGR are eligible for the favorable tax treatment\navailable under both the FSC and ETI regimes.

    "text": "In general, if a BCBS organization is acting as a \"Host\" plan, it collects the initial\nclaims data and forwards it to the Home plan for a determination whether the claim is\ncovered by the policy issued by the Home plan. The Host plan does not make any\ndetermination regarding the scope of coverage or the subscriber's eligibility for\ncoverage. The Home plan evaluates the data submitted by the Host plan, determines\nwhether or how much of the claim is allowable, and advises the Host plan of its\ndetermination. The Host plan then makes payment to the service provider and submits\na claim to the Home plan for reimbursement. All of the financial transactions between the Host plan and the Home plan are\ncarried out through a BCBSA entity which nets and automatically settles inter-licensee\nfinancial obligations arising from claims handled through these inter-plan programs. These net settlements are made on a daily basis by direct access to each plan's bank\naccounts. Thus, in one sense two BCBS plans do make \"payments\" with respect to an outof-territory claim. Initially the Host plan \"pays\" the claim submitted by the service\nprovider, but eventually the Home plan \"pays\" the claim by reimbursing the Host plan. Ultimately, however, only one BCBS plan -- the Home plan -- is responsible for the\npayment of the claim, and ultimately the claim is only paid once -- by the Home plan. LAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 833 represents a stage in the evolution of Blue Cross and Blue Shield\n(BCBS) organizations, which began during the Depression as community-based nonprofit organizations providing funding for health care and now rank among the largest\nhealth insurance companies on the New York stock exchange. Background on the special deduction. On December 7, 1985, the House\nCommittee on Ways and Means released a report on a bill entitled \u201cTax Reform Act of\n1985,\u201d H.R. 3838, 99th Cong. (1985). The Report expressed concern \"that exempt\ncharitable and social welfare organizations that engage in insurance activities are\nengaged in an activity whose nature and scope is so inherently commercial that taxexempt status is inappropriate. The committee believes that the tax-exempt status of\norganizations engaged in insurance activities provides an unfair competitive advantage\nto these organizations.\" H.R. Rep. No. 99-426 at 664 (1985). See also, Staff of the POSTU-144536-09 5 Joint Committee on Taxation, General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 at\n584 (1987). On October 25, 1985, before the House bill was passed, the Chairman of the\nSubcommittee on Health of the Committee on Ways and Means requested that the\nGeneral Accounting Office examine the potential impact on the availability of health\ninsurance that would result from taxing BCBS plans. On July 11, 1986, after the House\nbill had been passed but before the final statute was enacted, the General Accounting\nOffice transmitted a report to the Chairman entitled Health Insurance: Comparing Blue\nCross and Blue Shield Plans With Commercial Insurers, GAO/HRD-86-10 (July 1986). In preparing the report, GAO obtained information from the BCBSA and a draft of the\nreport was furnished to the Association for comment.",

    "text": "Conceivably, one could conclude from this decision that the pertinent statute of\nlimitations related to the trust, rather than to the grantors. However, the issue before\nthe Court was not whether the statute of limitations had expired; rather, the case\ninvolved whether a purchase of stock in exchange for the taxpayer\u2019s promissory note\ninvolved a \u201cloan\u201d under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 675(3) and whether the taxpayer or\nthe trust was entitled to an interest deduction. Please note that no other Second Circuit\ndecision cites Rothstein. In response to this decision, the Service issued Rev. Rul. 8513, 1985-1 C.B. 184, which states that the Service will not follow Rothstein to the extent\nthat it holds that a trust owned by a grantor must be regarded as a separate taxpayer\ncapable of engaging in sales transactions with the grantor. 3 We do not have the address of either ---------------------- or -------------------------. For purposes of this\nadvice, we assume that any litigation involving --------- or ------------------------- would also be appealable to\nthe Second Circuit. POSTF-103406-08 6 Other courts have found that the \u201creturn\u201d of a passthrough entity such as a grantor trust\ndoes not start the statute of limitations running because the statute of limitations should\napply to the person who pays the tax. That position is articulated in Siben v.\nCommissioner, 930 F.2d 1034, 1035 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 429 (1991),\nwhere the Court states, in a partnership context, that \u201cit appears to us that the \u2018return\u2019\nthat starts the running of the limitations period at issue is that of the taxpayer whose\nliability is being assessed and not that of a[n] \u2026 entity whose return might also report\nthe transaction that gives rise to the liability.\u201d Ultimately, the Court held that the\ncontrolling return was the individual income tax return. See also, \u00a7 6501(c)(4) requiring\nthe \u201ctaxpayer\u201d to consent to the extension of the period allowed for assessment. We\nrecognize that the Siben Court based its decision, in part, on the fact that a partnership\ndoes not itself report any tax imposed by the Code. In addition, the Court noted that the\npartnership return does not furnish information necessary to calculate the individual\npartner\u2019s income tax, such as income, losses, deductions or credits derived from third\nparty sources. Thus, the facts in Siben are not identical to the facts here. However, we\nconclude that the general principle articulated, that it is the return of the taxpayer whose\nliability is in issue that triggers the statute of limitations for assessment, applies in this\ngrantor trust context. Thus, if it is the individual grantors against whom you seek to assess tax, it is the\nindividual grantors that should extend their individual statute of limitations. To the\nextent that you propose to adjust items reported on each of the Forms 1041 filed by any\nof the subject grantor trusts, if any, the fiduciary for each trust should extend the statute\nof limitations. However, the safest approach is to get all the individual grantors and the\nfiduciaries for each of the grantor trusts to extend their respective statutes of limitations.",

    "text": "3 The basic purpose of I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a) is to allow a taxpayer to replace property\nor to continue an investment without realizing gain. S. E. Ponticos, Inc., v.\nCommissioner, 40 T.C. 60, 64 (1963). Courts have long recognized that I.R.C. \u00a7 1033\nis a relief provision that should be liberally construed to effect its purpose. E.g.,\nMassillon-Cleveland-Akron Sign Co. v. Commissioner, 15 T.C. 79, 83 (1950)\n(interpreting former I.R.C. \u00a7 112(f), the precursor to I.R.C. \u00a7 1033). 2 The cost of the replacement equipment itself represents the core relocation cost. However, the FCC\nalso requires that the Transition Administrator cover all costs of removing existing equipment, which the\nbroadcast stations have on towers and buildings, and in helicopters, trucks, and studios; and of installing\nthe replacement equipment. This equipment is part of an engineering system. Therefore, costs for\ndesign, integration, testing, and training will be incurred to ensure that the replacement equipment\nprovides comparable functionality to the broadcast stations. These costs must also be covered by the\nTransition Administrator. 3 I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a)(2) provides that if property so converted is converted into money or property not similar\nor related in service or use to the converted property, the gain (if any) shall be recognized except to the\nextent thereafter provided in that section. CC:LM:CTM:LA:2:POSTF-108806-08 page 4 I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a) deals with property that is compulsorily or involuntarily converted\nas a result of its destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, or requisition or\ncondemnation or threat or imminence thereof. For purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a), a\n\"conversion\" by condemnation or requisition means the process by which private\nproperty is taken for public use without the consent of the property owner but upon the\naward and payment of just compensation. Rev. Rul. 57-314, 1957-2 C.B. 523. Accordingly, the concept of a governmental taking for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a) has\nthree components: (1) there must be a \"taking\" of the taxpayer's rights in private\nproperty; (2) the taking must be for \"public use;\" and (3) the taxpayer must receive\n\u201cpayment of just compensation.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a)(1) provides that if property (as a result of its destruction in whole\nor in part, theft, seizure, or requisition or condemnation or threat or imminence thereof)\nis compulsorily or involuntarily converted into property similar or related in service or\nuse to the property so converted, no gain shall be recognized. Such nonrecognition of\ngain is mandatory under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1033(a)-2(b). In the present case, nonrecognition of gain under I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a)(1) will apply if\nthree requirements are met: (1) the BAS equipment of the broadcast stations are\n\u201ctaken\u201d by a governmental authority as a result of requisition or condemnation (or threat\nor imminence thereof); (2) the \u201ctaking\u201d is for public use; and (3) the replacement\nequipment is similar or related in service or use to the equipment so converted. These\nrequirements are discussed below. A. \"Taking\" of Rights in Private Property For purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 1033, a taking by governmental authority may include\nthe regulation against otherwise lawful use of private property in order to effect a public\npurpose.",

When figuring the amount on line 24,\ninclude household employment taxes\nonly if line 25d is more than zero or you\nwould have owed the estimated tax penalty for 2021 even if you didn't include\nthose taxes. If the Exception just described\ndoesn't apply, see the Instructions for\nForm 2210 for other situations in which\nyou may be able to lower your penalty\nby filing Form 2210. Figuring the Penalty If you choose to figure the penalty yourself, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farmers and fishermen). Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the\npenalty to any tax due and enter the total\non line 37. However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37. Don\u2019t file Form 2210 with your return unless Form 2210 indicates that you\nmust do so. Instead, keep it for your records. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. -60- Because Form 2210 is compli- TIP cated, you can leave line 38\nblank and the IRS will figure\nthe penalty and send you a bill. We\nwon't charge you interest on the penalty\nif you pay by the date specified on the\nbill. If your income varied during the\nyear, the annualized income installment\nmethod may reduce the amount of your\npenalty. But you must file Form 2210\nbecause the IRS can't figure your penalty under this method. Third Party Designee",
