    "text": "Accordingly, \u00a7 421(a) provides different tax treatment than \u00a7 83(a). Whereas \u00a7 83(a)\nrequires an employee to recognize income on the date of exercise of the nonstatutory\nstock option if the option did not have an ascertainable fair market value on the date of\ngrant, \u00a7 421(a)(1) does not require such recognition. Consistent with the policy that an\nemployer may deduct the compensatory element of a stock option only if the\ncompensatory element is included in the gross income of the employee, \u00a7 421(a)(2)\ndoes not permit a deduction for the compensatory element attributable to statutory stock\noptions because the compensatory element is excluded from the employee\u2019s gross\nincome. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.421-2(a)(1)(ii) reinforces this tax treatment by providing that,\n\u201cNo deduction under sections 83(h) or 162 or the regulations thereunder (relating to\ntrade or business expenses) is allowable to any time with respect to the share so\ntransferred. \u201d2\n2 Discussing an ISO, Example 7 of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.424-1(c)(4) notes in passing that a corporation is not POSTU-153378-08 2. 7 Legislative History of Section 421 The legislative history for ESPPs and ISOs demonstrate Congress\u2019s intent that\n\u00a7 421(a)(2) does not permit an employer to deduct the compensatory element of a\nstatutory stock option. The Revenue Act of 1964 provided the tax treatment for ESPPs. House Report No. 749 (1963) explained the intended tax treatment for stock options\ngranted pursuant to ESPPs: As indicated previously, except for the addition of the nondiscrimination\nrequirement (and the requiring of stockholder approval) the tax treatment of\nemployee stock purchase plans continues to be substantially similar to the tax\ntreatment of restricted stock options under present law. Thus, as under present\nlaw, no income is to be reported by the employee either at the time the option is\ngranted or at the time it is exercised. Similarly, no deduction is available to the\nemployer corporation with respect to the employee stock purchase plan. 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. (vol. 1) at 1377 (Emphasis added). The Report\u2019s provision that \u201cno\ndeduction is available to the employer corporation with respect to the employee stock\npurchase plan\u201d is unqualified. The Report does not provide that a deduction may be\navailable to the employer corporation under another section of the Code. Congress\nenacted \u00a7 174 in 1954. If Congress intended for a deduction to be available under\n\u00a7 174 for compensation attributable to stock options granted under an ESPP, it would\nhave qualified its 1964 statement that \u201cno deduction is available to the employer\ncorporation with respect to the employee stock purchase plan.\u201d House Report No. 749 also explained the intended tax treatment of qualified stock\noptions, which are the predecessors to ISOs:\nGenerally, in the case of qualified stock options, no income tax is imposed either\nat the time the option is granted or at the time the option is exercised and the\nstock is transferred to the employee. Similarly, no business expense deduction\nis allowed to the employer corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of that\ncorporation) at any time with respect to this option. 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. (vol. 1) at 1374 (Emphasis added).",

You or whoever enrolled\nyou should have received Form 1095-A\nfrom the Marketplace with information\nabout who was covered and any advance\npayments of the premium tax credit. Innocent Spouse Relief\nGenerally, both you and your spouse are\neach responsible for paying the full\namount of tax, interest, and penalties on\nyour joint return. However, you may\nqualify for relief from liability for tax on\na joint return if (a) there is an understatement of tax because your spouse\nomitted income or claimed false deductions or credits; (b) you are divorced,\nseparated, or no longer living with your\nspouse; or (c) given all the facts and circumstances, it wouldn't be fair to hold\nyou liable for the tax. You may also\nqualify for relief if you were a married\nresident of a community property state\nbut didn't file a joint return and are now\nliable for an unpaid or understated tax. File Form 8857 to request relief. In\nsome cases, Form 8857 may need to be\nfiled within 2 years of the date on which\nthe IRS first attempted to collect the tax\nfrom you. Don\u2019t file Form 8857 with\nyour Form 1040 or 1040-SR. For more\ninformation, see Pub. 971 and Form\n8857, or you can call the Innocent\nSpouse office toll free at 855-851-2009. Income Tax Withholding\nand Estimated Tax\nPayments for 2023 If your SSN has been lost or stolen or\nyou suspect you are a victim of tax-related identity theft, visit IRS.gov/\nIdentityTheft to learn what steps you\nshould take. You can use the Tax\nTIP Withholding Estimator instead\nof Pub. 505 or the worksheets\nincluded with Form W-4 or W-4P to determine whether you need to have your\nwithholding increased or decreased. Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a systemic\nproblem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that haven't been resolved through normal channels, may be\neligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service\n(TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS\nby calling the National Taxpayer Advocate helpline at 877-777-4778. People\nwho are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a\nspeech disability and who have access to\nTTY/TDD\nequipment\ncan\ncall\n800-829-4059. Deaf or hard-of-hearing\nindividuals can also contact the IRS\nthrough Telecommunications Relay\nServices at FCC.gov/TRS. Protect yourself from suspicious\nemails or phishing schemes. Phishing\nis the creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business emails and websites. The most\ncommon form is sending an email to a\nuser falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to\nscam the user into surrendering private\ninformation that will be used for identity\ntheft. In general, you don\u2019t have to make\nestimated tax payments if you expect\nthat your 2023 Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nwill show a tax refund or a tax balance\ndue of less than $1,000. If your total estimated tax for 2023 is $1,000 or more,\nsee Form 1040-ES and Pub. 505 for a\nworksheet you can use to see if you have\nto make estimated tax payments.

    "text": "Chevron, 467\nU.S. at 843. The Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle held the regulation valid because it \u201cis not\nmanifestly contrary to section 267(a)(3).\u201d 87 F.3d at 105. Similarly, the Tax Court in\nSquare D concluded that \u201c[r]egardless of whether petitioner or respondent (with whom\nwe happen to agree) has the better interpretation\u201d of the statute, the Secretary\u2019s\n\u201cconstruction, as embodied in the challenged regulation, is a permissible one,\u201d and,\n\u201c[u]nder the Chevron doctrine, that settles the matter.\u201d 118 T.C. 299 at *312. POSTF-108700-08 11\nPermissible Application of the Matching Principle When trying to determine how the matching principle of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) should\nbe applied, one argument is that it only applies where there is a timing mismatch in\nitems of income and deduction between related taxpayers due to differences in\naccounting methods, and that if the mismatch is not due to a difference in accounting\nmethod, the matching principle of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) does not apply. This notion is\nincorrect. In the first place, I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) does not use the term \u201cmatching\nprinciple\u201d that the Secretary is directed in I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3) to apply by regulation, nor\ndoes any other section of the Internal Revenue Code use that exact term. Thus,\nnothing in the plain language of the statute requires that the matching principle be\ndefined as only including a difference in accounting methods. Further, when Congress enacted the present version of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) in\n1984, it was directed at mismatches in income and deduction that occurred as a result\nof differences in accounting methods, because it was that narrow situation that\nCongress viewed as giving rise to abuse, and thus a difference in accounting methods\nwas made the \u201ctrigger.\u201d In I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3), Congress directed the Secretary to issue\nregulations addressing other circumstances in which mismatches occur when foreign\nentities are involved, but it does not further specify what those circumstances are. Rather, the statute delegates broad authority to the Secretary to determine when, and\nunder what circumstances, \u201cthe matching principle of\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) should be\napplied. As Judge Swift reasoned in his Tax Court dissent in Tate & Lyle, 103 T.C. at\n681: It is apparent that a treaty may represent the\nreason and cause for a mismatch in the tax\nreporting and treatment of items of income and\nexpense as between domestic taxpayers and\nrelated foreign parties, and the conclusion is\ncompelling that [the Secretary] has been\ndelegated regulatory authority under section\n267(a)(3) to provide that such a reason and cause\nfor a mismatch will trigger the correction\ncontemplated by section 267. The bottom line is that what Congress did in I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3) was instruct the\nSecretary to issue regulations defining other circumstances in which the matching\nprinciple of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) should apply when foreign entities are involved. Congress did not instruct the Secretary to limit the triggering mechanism to the\napplication of the regulation to differences engendered by a method of accounting. Thus, the application of the plain meaning rule here makes clear that Congress granted\nthe Secretary broad authority to determine when, and under what circumstances, the\nmatching principle of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) should be applied.
