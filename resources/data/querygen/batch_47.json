    "text": "Texas & Pacific\nRailway Co. v. U.S., 286 U.S. 285, 290 (1932). Taxpayer's use of the BEA payments to\npay operating expenses merely subsidized its current operations. Therefore, the BEA\npayments did not become a permanent part of Taxpayer\u2019s working capital structure. Second, the BEA payments were payments for specific services provided. Our\nconclusion is based upon the aforementioned criteria established by the Fund for\nreceipt of a BEA payment, the mechanisms employed to calculate the amount of BEA\npayments, the lack of restrictions on the use of the BEA payments by recipients,\nTaxpayer\u2019s increase of its general revenue account for receipt of the BEA payments,\nand the issuance of Forms 1099-G. As discussed above, it is our opinion that the BEA\npayments were intended to supplement Taxpayer\u2019s operating revenue in exchange for\nproviding banking activities in distressed communities. While a public benefit is clearly\nderived from the BEA program, it is our opinion that the BEA program was merely a\nconduit by which financial institutions are compensated for qualifying activities in\ndistressed communities. Third, there is no evidence of any bargaining relative to the BEA payments. The\namount of the BEA payment is unilaterally prescribed by the Fund without any\nnegotiation between the parties. The BEA payment is based upon Taxpayer\u2019s increase POSTF-147002-10 10 in equity investment, lending and deposit activities in distressed communities from the\nprior award year. In Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R., the Supreme Court held that\ngovernment subsidies to construct improvements, including overpasses, crossings and\nsignage, were not contributions to the taxpayer\u2019s capital as the payments were not in\nany real sense bargained for by the taxpayer. 412 U.S. at 413-414. Moreover, the\nFund has complete discretion as to the amount of any BEA payment made to Taxpayer. Finally, the BEA payments were not employed in or contribute to the production\nof additional income. During the taxable years *** c and *** d, the BEA payments could\nbe used for any purpose and were not exclusively restricted to the acquisition of capital\nassets or the making of capital investments. Taxpayer's use of the BEA payments to\npay operating expenses and its failure to invest the BEA payments in any capital assets\nprecludes the generation of additional income from the BEA payments. Application of Section 362 Even assuming that Taxpayer could show that the BEA payments satisfy the\nrequirements for exclusion under section 118, Taxpayer failed to reduce the basis of\nany assets in accordance with section 362. If a contribution to capital has been made\nunder section 118, then the basis of the contributed property in the hands of the\ntaxpayer must be determined. A contribution of property other than money by a\nnonshareholder to the capital of a corporation will result in the property having a basis of\nzero. I.R.C. \u00a7 362(c)(1). In the event that money is contributed by a nonshareholder,\nthen any property acquired with the money during the following 12 months shall have its\nbasis reduced by the amount of the contribution. I.R.C. \u00a7 362(c)(2).",

Where's My Refund will provide a\npersonalized refund date as soon as the\nIRS processes your tax return and approves your refund. Effect of refund on benefits. Any refund you receive can't be counted as income when determining if you or anyone else is eligible for benefits or\nassistance, or how much you or anyone\nelse can receive, under any federal program or under any state or local program\nfinanced in whole or in part with federal\nfunds. These programs include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families\n(TANF), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Supplemental\nNutrition Assistance Program (formerly\nfood stamps). In addition, when determining eligibility, the refund can't be\ncounted as a resource for at least 12\nmonths after you receive it. Check with\nyour local benefit coordinator to find out\nif your refund will affect your benefits. DIRECT DEPOSIT Simple. Safe. Secure. Fast Refunds! Join the eight in 10 taxpayers\nwho choose direct deposit\u2014a fast, simple, safe,\nsecure way to have your refund deposited\nautomatically to your checking or savings\naccount, including an individual retirement\narrangement (IRA). See the information about\nIRAs, later. If you want us to directly deposit the\namount shown on line 35a to your\nchecking or savings account, including\nan IRA, at a bank or other financial institution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union) in the United\nStates:\n\u2022 Complete lines 35b through 35d (if\nyou want your refund deposited to only\none account), or\n\u2022 Check the box on line 35a and attach Form 8888 if you want to split the\ndirect deposit of your refund into more\nthan one account or use all or part of\nyour refund to buy paper series I savings\nbonds. If you don\u2019t want your refund directly deposited to your account, don\u2019t check the box on line 35a. Draw a line\nthrough the boxes on lines 35b and 35d. We will send you a check instead. Account must be in your name. Don\u2019t\nrequest a deposit of your refund to an\naccount that isn't in your name, such as\nyour tax return preparer\u2019s account. Although you may owe your tax return\npreparer a fee for preparing your return,\ndon\u2019t have any part of your refund deposited into the preparer's account to pay\nthe fee. The number of refunds that can be directly deposited to a single account or\nprepaid debit card is limited to three a\nyear. After this limit is reached, paper\nchecks will be sent instead. Learn more\nat IRS.gov/DepositLimit. Why Use Direct Deposit? \u2022 You get your refund faster by direct deposit than you do by check. \u2022 Payment is more secure. There is\nno check that can get lost or stolen. \u2022 It is more convenient. You don\u2019t\nhave to make a trip to the bank to deposit your check. \u2022 It saves tax dollars. It costs the\ngovernment less to refund by direct deposit.\n\u2022 It's proven itself. Nearly 98% of\nsocial security and veterans' benefits are\nsent electronically using direct deposit.",

How Long Should\nRecords Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items\nappearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and\n1099) until the statute of limitations runs\nout for that return. Usually, this is 3\nyears from the date the return was due or\nfiled or 2 years from the date the tax was\npaid, whichever is later. You should\nkeep some records longer. For example,\nkeep property records (including those\non your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or\nreplacement property. For more details,\nsee chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return\nFile Form 1040-X to change a return\nyou already filed. Generally, Form\n1040-X must be filed within 3 years af- ter the date the original return was filed\nor within 2 years after the date the tax\nwas paid, whichever is later. But you\nmay have more time to file Form\n1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically\nor mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. Use the Where's My Amended Return\napplication on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return.

Check that both the name and SSN\non your Forms 1040 or 1040-SR, W-2,\nand 1099 agree with your social security\ncard. If they don\u2019t, certain deductions\nand credits on Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nmay be reduced or disallowed and you\nmay not receive credit for your social\nsecurity earnings. If your Form W-2\nshows an incorrect SSN or name, notify\nyour employer or the form-issuing agent\nas soon as possible to make sure your\nearnings are credited to your social security record. If the name or SSN on\nyour social security card is incorrect,\ncall the SSA. Once you are issued an SSN, use it to\nfile your tax return. Use your SSN to file -14- your tax return even if your SSN does\nnot authorize employment or if you have\nbeen issued an SSN that authorizes employment and you lose your employment authorization. An ITIN will not be\nissued to you once you have been issued\nan SSN. If you received your SSN after\npreviously using an ITIN, stop using\nyour ITIN. Use your SSN instead. IRS Individual Taxpayer\nIdentification Numbers\n(ITINs) for Aliens If you are a nonresident or resident alien\nand you don\u2019t have and aren\u2019t eligible to\nget an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN. If you already have an ITIN, enter it\nwherever your SSN is requested on your\ntax return. Some ITINs must be renewed. If you\nhaven't used your ITIN on a federal tax\nreturn at least once for tax years 2019,\n2020, or 2021, it expired at the end of\n2022 and must be renewed if you need\nto file a federal tax return in 2023. You\ndon't need to renew your ITIN if you\ndon't need to file a federal tax return. You can find more information at\nIRS. gov/ITIN. ITINs assigned before 2013\nTIP have expired and must be renewed if you need to file a tax\nreturn in 2023. If you previously submitted a renewal application and it was approved, you do not need to renew again\nunless you haven't used your ITIN on a\nfederal tax return at least once for tax\nyears 2019, 2020, or 2021. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't\nentitle you to social security benefits or\nchange your employment or immigration status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, including application, expiration, and renewal, see Form W-7 and its instructions. If you receive an SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS\noffice or write a letter to the IRS explaining that you now have an SSN and\nwant all your tax records combined under your SSN.

The levy identified the taxpayer as -------------- and levied his personal accounts. His social security\nnumber was the identifying number on the levies. The levies\nstated that the levies attached to accounts of ---------------as owner of ---------------, LLC, but not to accounts in the\nname of ---------------, LLC which were also maintained at the\nbanks upon which the levies were served. No liability has been assessed against --------------- as\nthe person responsible for collecting and paying over the trust\nfund portion of the payroll taxes of ------------ under I.R.C. \u00a7\n6672. -------------- seeks relief through the TAS on the ground\nthat the levy on his individual bank accounts to collect the\nliability of the LLC incurred when it was taxable as a\npartnership was improper.
