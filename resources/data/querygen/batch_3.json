I.R.C. \u00a7 1001(a). The \u201camount realized\u201d is \u201cthe sum of any money received\nplus the fair market value of the property (other than money) received.\u201d I.R.C.\n\u00a7 1001(b). Accordingly under said section, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this\nsubtitle, the entire amount of the gain or loss, determined under this section on the sale\nor exchange of property shall be recognized.\u201d This is the general rule, with any\ndeferrals or exceptions a matter of legislative grace. For gain from debt instruments issued for property, Treas. Reg. \u00a71.1001-1(g)(1)\nprovides, in general, that \u201c[i]f a debt instrument is issued in exchange for property, the\namount realized attributable to the debt instrument is the issue price of the debt\ninstrument as determined under [Treas.

In general, section 29 provides a credit for the\nproduction of solid synthetic fuel from coal. Section 29(g)(1)\nprovides a tax credit for the sale of qualified fuels that are\nsold through the end of 2007 and produced from a facility that\nwas originally placed in service after December 31, 1992, and CC:LM:NR:----Page 19\nbefore July 1, 1998, pursuant to a binding written contract that\nwas in effect before January 1, 1997. No regulations have been\npromulgated under section 29. Thus, we look to other published\nguidance of the Service and other analogous Code sections to\ninterpret the meaning and scope of that section, in particular\nthe meaning of placed in service. In general, property is placed in service in the taxable\nyear the property is placed in a condition or state of readiness\nand availability for a specifically designed function. See,\nTreas. Reg. sections 1.46-3(d)(1)(ii) and 1.167(a)-11(e)(1)(i). Placed in service is construed as having the same meaning for\npurposes of the investment tax credit under section 46 and\ndepreciation under section 167, in Rev. Proc. 2001-30, 2001-1\nC.B. 1163 and in private letter rulings. Section 1.46-3(d)(2)\nprovides examples of when property is in a condition of\nreadiness and availability. One of those examples is equipment\nthat is acquired for a specifically assigned function and is\noperational but undergoing tests to eliminate any defects.",

    "text": "It usually takes\nabout 2 weeks to get an SSN once the\nSSA has all the evidence and information it needs. Check that both the name and SSN\non your Forms 1040 or 1040-SR, W-2,\nand 1099 agree with your social security\ncard. If they don\u2019t, certain deductions\nand credits on Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nmay be reduced or disallowed and you\nmay not receive credit for your social\nsecurity earnings. If your Form W-2\nshows an incorrect SSN or name, notify\nyour employer or the form-issuing agent\nas soon as possible to make sure your\nearnings are credited to your social security record. If the name or SSN on\nyour social security card is incorrect,\ncall the SSA. Once you are issued an SSN, use it to\nfile your tax return. Use your SSN to file -14- your tax return even if your SSN does\nnot authorize employment or if you have\nbeen issued an SSN that authorizes employment and you lose your employment authorization. An ITIN will not be\nissued to you once you have been issued\nan SSN. If you received your SSN after\npreviously using an ITIN, stop using\nyour ITIN. Use your SSN instead. IRS Individual Taxpayer\nIdentification Numbers\n(ITINs) for Aliens If you are a nonresident or resident alien\nand you don\u2019t have and aren\u2019t eligible to\nget an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN. If you already have an ITIN, enter it\nwherever your SSN is requested on your\ntax return. Some ITINs must be renewed. If you\nhaven't used your ITIN on a federal tax\nreturn at least once for tax years 2019,\n2020, or 2021, it expired at the end of\n2022 and must be renewed if you need\nto file a federal tax return in 2023. You\ndon't need to renew your ITIN if you\ndon't need to file a federal tax return. You can find more information at\nIRS. gov/ITIN. ITINs assigned before 2013\nTIP have expired and must be renewed if you need to file a tax\nreturn in 2023. If you previously submitted a renewal application and it was approved, you do not need to renew again\nunless you haven't used your ITIN on a\nfederal tax return at least once for tax\nyears 2019, 2020, or 2021. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't\nentitle you to social security benefits or\nchange your employment or immigration status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, including application, expiration, and renewal, see Form W-7 and its instructions. If you receive an SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS\noffice or write a letter to the IRS explaining that you now have an SSN and\nwant all your tax records combined under your SSN. Details about what to include with the letter and where to mail it\nare at IRS. gov/ITIN. Nonresident Alien Spouse If your spouse is a nonresident alien,\nyour spouse must have either an SSN or\nan ITIN if:\n\u2022 You file a joint return, or\n\u2022 Your spouse is filing a separate return.

A and its affiliates\nA is an S corporation and a full-service restaurant management company based in B. It maintains its books and files its income tax returns on the accrual basis with a 52-53\nweek fiscal year ending on the last Wednesday of the calendar year. Its financial\nstatements are audited annually by an independent certified public accounting firm. The firm has provided an unqualified opinion for all years and has also prepared and\nsigned A\u2019s tax returns. A has sold gift certificates since the Service began auditing the taxpayer; in Year 24,\nit replaced the certificates with plastic gift cards in varying denominations. A has\nconsistently accounted for its receipts from the sales under section 1.451-5 of the\nregulations. The Internal Revenue Service (the Service) has audited the returns of A\nand its affiliates on a number of occasions since the Service began auditing the\ntaxpayer and, according to A, there is no record of the Service\u2019s having previously\nexamined A \u2019s reliance on Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.451-5.\nA was incorporated in Year 1 to succeed by merger to #AA affiliated restaurant\ncorporations. The merger did not result in a change of control or operation of the\nrestaurants. Since the merger, A has closed all but the first of the #AA restaurants, C.\nIn the Service began auditing the taxpayer, however, when A began selling gift\ncertificates and accounting for them under Treas. Reg. 1.451-5, it owned and operated\n#OO or #JJ of the original #AA restaurants. A affiliates then owned and operated POSTF-134398-08 4 approximately #BB restaurants.1 All or substantially all of the restaurants participated\nin A\u2019s gift card (then gift certificate) program. Today, A continues to own and operate one affiliated restaurant corporation, C(in its\noriginal leased premises in B), and manages approximately #CC other affiliated\nrestaurants. These restaurants are owned by S corporations, partnerships and\nlimited liability companies (taxed as partnerships). A has an equity interest (in varying\namounts from nominal to substantial) in a number of these restaurants. A provides\nstaffing, administrative, and/or management services to these restaurants.

CONCLUSIONS The Closing Agreement does not prevent the IRS from changing the taxpayer\u2019s LIFO\ndefinition of an item for tax years after Year 1. The language of the Closing Agreement\ndoes not reflect an agreement between the parties as to the appropriateness of the\ntaxpayer\u2019s LIFO item definitions or the permissibility of such item definitions in future\nyears.

Of course, we cannot now (on the grounds of consistency)\ndisallow the ------- deduction, as the statute of limitations on assessment has expired for\nthat fiscal year. But the Service need not allow a similar deduction in ------- on the grounds\nof consistency. Consistency objections could also be raised due to the Service disallowing the costs of\nthe *** al -------------- of ------- while allowing other contributions to or expenses of the\ncompany ------------ in that year. Again, we note that the Service is not obliged to disallow\nevery deduction that could conceivably be challenged; the Service can allow some\nquestionable deductions while disallowing others. In this case, the Service does not\nchoose to question whether the entire ------------ and all of its costs are defensible as an\nadvertising and promotional expense in the years under examination. The taxpayer states\n(without citation to any authority) that the deduction of the costs of company ------------- on\nthe grounds that they promote the company and its products is not unheard of. It is entirely\npossible that the taxpayer in this case can justify and substantiate that the ------------ in\ngeneral (and the ----- *** v are legitimate advertising expenses; we maintain, however, that\nthe taxpayer has not proven that the costs of the ----------------------were primarily business\nrather than personal under \u00a7\u00a7 162(a) and 262, and that the -------------- resulted in any\nuseful promotional communication to potential customers, or was intended to do so, at least\nnot on a scale commensurate to the size of the ----------------. Of course, consistent with the expense not being deductible on the corporate return, that\npart of the cost of the -------------- which is a personal benefit to the president of the\ncompany is income to him not reported on his return. It is at the discretion of the\nCompliance Division, however, whether an examination of the president\u2019s individual return\nshould be opened and an adjustment proposed; this decision involves matters regarding\nthe allocation of IRS time and resources that are beyond the scope of Counsel\u2019s knowledge\nand authority. Conclusion We conclude that there is no legal basis for deducting the costs of the fiscal year -----------------------to locate the ------------- of the ------------------.
