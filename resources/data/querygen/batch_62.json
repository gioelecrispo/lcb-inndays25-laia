    "text": "d. Basis for determining outstanding gift cards A\u2019s tax and audited balance sheets report the entire liability for all outstanding gift\ncards, whether sold by A or the other Participating Restaurants. At the beginning and\nend of Year 27, the reported liabilities for the unredeemed gift cards were $QL and\n$QM, respectively. Those amounts were determined by adjusting the beginning\nbalance for cash receipts and cash disbursements resulting from the sale and\nredemption of gift cards and were verified using generally accepted auditing\nstandards. A management has stated that, due to the high demand for the gift cards during the\nyear-end holiday season, gift cards are activated by A before being distributed to the\nother Participating Restaurants and sold by them.7 A management believes the\nprocedure is necessary because: (i) the unusually high volume of gift cards sold during\nthe holiday season makes it logistically impractical to activate cards as sold; (ii) it\n7 A has acknowledged the following: A changed its process for issuing gift cards in Year 24. Prior to Year\n24, the company activated gift cards at the time they were sold. In Year 24, A began to activate cards\nprior to issuing them to the stores in order to make the process more efficient and to free-up store\nmanagers\u2019 time. A states that the problem with the change is that A\u2019s gift card system tracks outstanding\ngift cards based on activation date rather than sale date. This does not present A a problem in\ndetermining the gift card liability because management can subtract its gift card inventory from the total\ngift cards activated to arrive at the true number of gift certificates outstanding. This is a problem when\nestimating the amount of income to recognize in a particular year because the inventory is not\naged by activation date. This makes it difficult for management to determine when the gift cards\ncurrently outstanding were actually sold. (Emphasis added). POSTF-134398-08 10 enables the restaurant managers to concentrate on running their respective restaurants\nduring the busy season and (iii) the procedure minimizes the possibility of the\nrestaurants\u2019 selling non-activated cards that would create problems on redemption. Participating Restaurants who do not sell \"activated\" gift cards at year end can return\nthe unsold activated cards to A. A then places the returned cards into its inventory of\nactivated but not sold gift cards. At any point during the year, a Participating Restaurant\ncan request additional gift cards from A in any denomination. A may then transfer from\ninventory previously activated gift cards that had been returned to it from one\nParticipating Restaurant and send those back out to a different Participating\nRestaurant. During the Year 27 year, A activated gift cards totaling $QN. Of those activated, $QO in\ngift cards was outstanding at year-end, and gift card sales totaled $QB. A total of $QP\nreflects the value of cards sold in Year 27 that were redeemed during the year. A uses an outside vendor to track the issuance and aging of the gift cards. A also\nattempts to track the aging of the gift cards and the gift card liability in-house using\nspreadsheets and other programs.",

If the generic applicant makes a paragraph IV certification and suit\nis brought within forty-five days, final approval is stayed for thirty\nmonths or until a court decision of validity and non-infringement. If\nthe case is resolved in favor of the patent owner, the court must\norder that final approval take effect no earlier than patent expiry. If\nthe litigation is ongoing at the conclusion of the thirty months, FDA\nmust approve the ANDA if it is otherwise approvable, and the\ngeneric applicant may market its product. In this case,\nhowever, [the ANDA holder] risks damages for patent infringement\nif it later loses the lawsuit. The patent owner may bring a patent\ninfringement suit later, but if it brings suit after the forty-five day\nnotice period, there is no thirty-month stay of generic approval. Krista Hessler Carver, Jeffrey Elikan and Erika Lietzan, An Unofficial Legislative History\nof the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, 65 Food & Drug L.J. 671,\n678 (2010)(footnotes omitted). To counter the burden of being sued for infringement, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides\nan incentive for the generic company to expose itself to an infringement suit in order to\nbring a generic drug to market, a 180-day period of exclusivity for the generic product in\nthe market. The fundamental goal behind 180-day exclusivity was to provide an\nincentive for generic drug applicants to challenge innovator patents,\nand the core of the concept--as it has been applied by the Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) and the courts--is that the first\ngeneric drug applicant to challenge an innovator's patent is entitled\nto six months of exclusivity against subsequent patent challengers\nfor the same innovator drug. 180-day exclusivity is governed by\nsections 505(j)(5)(B)(iv) and 505(j)(5)(D) of the FDCA.",

    "text": "Similar provisions under\nsection 162 provide guidance. In pertinent part, section 162(a)\nallows as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses\npaid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any\ntrade or business. To qualify as such a deduction, an\nexpenditure must: (1) be paid or incurred during the taxable CC:LM:NR:----Page 22\nyear, (2) be for carrying on any trade or business, (3) be an\nexpense, (4) be necessary, and (5) be ordinary. Commissioner v.\nLincoln Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 403 U.S. 345, 352 (1971). The\ninstant issue concerns the interpretation of the second\nrequirement. Neither the Code nor the regulations provide any explicit\ndefinition of the term \u201ccarrying on any trade or business\u201d for\npurposes of section 162. The Supreme Court has stated that to\nbe engaged in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d for purposes of section 162,\nthe taxpayer must be involved in the activity with continuity\nand regularity, and the taxpayer\u2019s primary purpose for engaging\nin the activity must be for income or profit. Commissioner v.\nGroetzinger, 480 U.S. 23, 35 (1987). Determining whether a\ntaxpayer is carrying on a trade or business for purposes of\nsection 162 requires an examination of the facts in each case. 480 U.S. at 36. In Richmond Television Corp., supra, the Fourth Circuit\naddressed the issue of the point in time at which the taxpayer\u2019s\nbusiness began. After reviewing other cases to see the\nevidentiary bases on which factual determinations were made, the\ncourt stated the following rule: \u201c[E]ven though a taxpayer has\nmade a firm decision to enter into business and over a\nconsiderable period of time spent money in preparation for\nentering that business, he still has not \u2018engaged in carrying on\nany trade or business\u2019 within the intendment of section 162(a)\nuntil such time as the business has begun to function as a going\nconcern and performed those activities for which it was\norganized.\u201d 345 F.2d at 907 (footnote omitted). In Jackson v.\nCommissioner, 864 F.2d 1521, 1526 n.7 (10th Cir. 1989), the\ncourt discussed the case of Kennedy v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1973-15, which held that a pharmacy did not begin to function as\na going concern until the date it first opened its doors to the\npublic. The Jackson court explained that, although sales\npresumably followed, this holding properly focused on the\ntaxpayer\u2019s \u201copening its doors\u201d to attempt to make a sale, and\nnot on the taxpayer\u2019s success at selling. We do not find the facts, as developed, as providing\nsufficient basis to allow the credits. It does not appear that\nCorporation or Partnerships A, B, C, and D were engaged in the\ntrade or business of producing and selling Synthetic Fuel as of\nthe cut-off date for purposes of the section 29 credit. None of\nthese entities had an existing business to supply coal or\nsynthetic fuel prior to that time. While the taxpayer presented\nAgreement A, it is not certain when Corporation and k entered CC:LM:NR:----Page 23\ninto that contract. Further, it created no real obligation for\nk to purchase Synthetic Fuel.",
