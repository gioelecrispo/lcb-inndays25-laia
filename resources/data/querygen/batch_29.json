If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a qualiTIP fying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the\nEIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying\nchild. For more information, see Pub. 596. Example. Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J\u2019s\nother parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a\nqualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for\nwhich you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the\nfive tax benefits listed here based on J. However, if your parent\u2019s AGI is higher than yours and you don\u2019t claim J as a qualifying child, J is the qualifying child of your parent. For more details and examples, see Pub. 596.

For the EIC, a valid SSN is a\nnumber issued by the Social Security Administration unless\n\u201cNot Valid for Employment\u201d is printed on the social security\ncard and the number was issued solely to allow the recipient of\nthe SSN to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit. However, if \u201cValid for Work Only With DHS Authorization\u201d is printed on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC purposes only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid. To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number\n(SSN) near the beginning of these instructions. If you won't\nhave an SSN by the date your return is due, see What if You\nCan't File on Time? If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of\nyour 2022 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC\non your original or an amended 2022 return. If a child didn't\nhave an SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (including extensions), you can't count that child as a qualifying\nchild in figuring the amount of the EIC on your original or an\namended 2022 return.

Do the facts, as set forth below, support the taxpayers\u2019\ncontention that a synfuel facilities constructed for Corporation\nat the Facility Location were placed in service before July 1,\n1998? Sub-issues of this issue are as follows:\na. Do the facts show that the taxpayers that owned the\nfacilities as of July 1, 1998, were in the trade or business of\nproducing and selling qualified fuel? CC:LM:NR:----Page 7\nb. What additional information will assist in\ndetermining whether the facilities were timely placed in\nservice? 2. Were the facilities placed in service pursuant to a\nbinding written contract in effect as of January 1, 1997? CONCLUSION 1. The facts, as presented, raise serious questions about\nwhether the a synfuel facilities constructed for Corporation at\nthe Facility Location were placed in service before July 1,\n1998. a. The facts are insufficient to show that the\ntaxpayers that owned the facilities as of July 1, 1998, were in\nthe trade or business of producing and selling qualified fuel. b. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2. There appears to be some question as to whether the\ncontract was, in fact, a binding written contract as of January\n1, 1997. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FACTS 1.\nOn or about Execution Date, Corporation entered into\nan agreement with c for the construction of d Facilities. The\nagreements enumerate several types and amounts of equipment for\nthe facilities. The equipment described in the agreement\nrelated to systems that were designed to accomplish the Process. Among other things, the agreement listed e, f, g, and other\nequipment designed for the Process. Additional equipment\nfocused on Subprocess. This plan was described in a Date 1 CC:LM:NR:----Page 8\nreport by a construction/engineering firm, apparently prepared\nfor h. Some time during Timeframe 1, the agreement was assigned to\ni. During Timeframe 2, construction began on a synthetic fuel\nproduction facilities at the Facility Location, near j. This\nsite is owned by k, a subsidiary of l. While Corporation acted\nas the owner of the facilities during construction, at some\npoint, these facilities were transferred to, and owned by\nPartnership A, Partnership B, Partnership C, and Partnership D.\nEach was a State X entity, formed on Date 2. A construction permit was obtained in Month 3. Construction\nbegan at the Facility Location on or about Date 4. Plans called\nfor the construction of a facilities, each projected to cost\napproximately $m. It appears that n of the plants were\nconstructed by i, and the remainder by c. The taxpayers produced several videotapes, labeled with\ndates between Date 5 and Date 6, showing equipment operating at\nthe site. Among the parts of a facility shown to be running\nwere o, p, and q. What was clear was that some of the feedstock\ncoal was run through r. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The videotapes\ndid not show operation of s. No narrative accompanied the\nimages shown on the videotapes, making it difficult to discern\nwhat was being shown. It was not clear from the videotape that\neach of the a facilities was operational.",

Enter on line 5a the distribution from\nForm 1099-R, box 1. From this amount,\nsubtract any contributions (usually\nshown in box 5) that were taxable to you\nwhen made. From that result, subtract\nthe amount of the rollover. Enter the remaining amount on line 5b. If the remaining amount is zero and you have no\nother distribution to report on line 5b,\nenter -0- on line 5b. Also enter \"Rollover\" next to line 5b. See Pub. 575 for more details on rollovers, including special rules that apply\nto rollovers from designated Roth accounts, partial rollovers of property, and\ndistributions under qualified domestic\nrelations orders. Lump-Sum Distributions If you received a lump-sum distribution\nfrom a profit-sharing or retirement plan,\nyour Form 1099-R should have the \"Total distribution\" box in box 2b checked. You may owe an additional tax if you\nreceived an early distribution from a\nqualified retirement plan and the total\namount wasn't rolled over.

If you are filing online using\nsoftware, you must use a Self-Select\nPIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a\nSelf-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. For 2022, if we issued you an identity\nprotection personal identification number (IP PIN) (as described in more detail\nbelow), all six digits of your IP PIN\nmust appear in the IP PIN spaces provi- ded next to the space for your occupation for your electronic signature to be\ncomplete.

If you are filing a joint return and\nboth taxpayers were issued an IP PIN,\nenter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN\nmethod allows you to create your own\nPIN. If you are married filing jointly,\nyou and your spouse will each need to\ncreate a PIN and enter these PINs as\nyour electronic signatures. A PIN is any combination of five digits you choose except five zeros. If you\nuse a PIN, there is nothing to sign and\nnothing to mail\u2014not even your Forms\nW-2.

If you're filing\njointly, your electronic return must also\ninclude your spouse's PIN, last name,\ndate of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and\nAGI, if applicable, in order to be considered validly signed. Don\u2019t use your AGI\nfrom an amended return (Form 1040-X)\nor a math error correction made by the\nIRS. AGI is the amount shown on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11.
