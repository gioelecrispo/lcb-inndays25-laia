    "text": "Exception. You won't owe the penalty\nif your 2021 tax return was for a tax\nyear of 12 full months and either of the\nfollowing applies. 1. You had no tax shown on your\n2021 return and you were a U.S. citizen\nor resident for all of 2021. 2. The total of lines 25d, 26, and\nSchedule 3, line 11, on your 2022 return\nis at least 100% of the tax shown on\nyour 2021 return (110% of that amount\nif you aren't a farmer or fisherman, and your adjusted gross income (AGI)\nshown on your 2021 return was more\nthan $150,000 (more than $75,000 if\nmarried filing separately for 2022)). Your estimated tax payments for 2022\nmust have been made on time and for\nthe required amount. For most people, the \u201ctax shown on\nyour 2021 return\u201d is the amount on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24,\nminus the total of any amounts shown\non lines 27a, 28, 29, and 30; Schedule 3,\nlines 9, 12, 13b, 13g, and 13h; and\nForms 8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III\nthrough IX only), 8885, and 8919. Also\nsubtract from line 24 any:\n\u2022 Tax on an excess parachute payment,\n\u2022 Excise tax on insider stock compensation of an expatriated corporation,\n\u2022 Uncollected social security and\nMedicare or RRTA tax on tips or\ngroup-term life insurance, and\n\u2022 Look-back interest due under section 167(g) or 460(b). When figuring the amount on line 24,\ninclude household employment taxes\nonly if line 25d is more than zero or you\nwould have owed the estimated tax penalty for 2021 even if you didn't include\nthose taxes. If the Exception just described\ndoesn't apply, see the Instructions for\nForm 2210 for other situations in which\nyou may be able to lower your penalty\nby filing Form 2210. Figuring the Penalty If you choose to figure the penalty yourself, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farmers and fishermen). Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the\npenalty to any tax due and enter the total\non line 37. However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37. Don\u2019t file Form 2210 with your return unless Form 2210 indicates that you\nmust do so. Instead, keep it for your records. Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov. -60- Because Form 2210 is compli- TIP cated, you can leave line 38\nblank and the IRS will figure\nthe penalty and send you a bill. We\nwon't charge you interest on the penalty\nif you pay by the date specified on the\nbill. If your income varied during the\nyear, the annualized income installment\nmethod may reduce the amount of your\npenalty. But you must file Form 2210\nbecause the IRS can't figure your penalty under this method. Third Party Designee",

However, if you have an overpayment on line 34, subtract the penalty\nfrom the amount you would otherwise\nenter on line 35a or line 36. Lines 35a,\n36, and 38 must equal line 34. If the penalty is more than the overpayment on line 34, enter -0- on lines\n35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from\nline 38 and enter the result on line 37.

    "text": "Thus, the position articulated in IRM 21.5.9.5.16 (6)(a) is correct. 2. Items such as taxable social security benefits, Schedule A itemized\ndeductions, and exemptions should be recomputed using the married filing\nseparate rules to arrive at: a) the amount of the NOL deduction in the\ncarryover/carryback year; and b) the separate taxable income of each spouse. 3. After the correct NOL deduction has been, the NOL deduction should be taken into\naccount by the loss spouse in determining his or her tax liability for the carryback year\nas if the spouses had filed separate returns in the carryback year. A separate tax\nliability must also be computed for the non-loss spouse. Further, the NOL deduction is\ntaken into account in computing a new joint tax liability for the carryback year. After\nthese calculations are completed, the recomputed joint return tax liability is allocated\nbetween the spouses based on their separate tax liability. Thus, the separate tax\nliabilities are computed solely for purposes of allocating the new joint tax liability and\ndetermining who is entitled to the refund. 4. Various revenue rulings and regulations suggest that all Subtitle A income taxes are\nto be taken into account in determining the amount of the recomputed joint tax liability\nallocated to each spouse. In this regard, the proper fraction to use to determine Spouse\n1\u2019s allocable joint liability would be as follows:\nSpouse 1\u2019s separate tax liability\nSpouse 1 and 2\u2019s tax liability x New Joint Tax liability (using NOL) S2\u2019s allocable joint tax liability would be determined in the same manner. Taxes that\nare not in Subtitle A, such as the gift tax or the Schedule H tax, would not be allocated\nin accordance with the above computation. 5. If the spouses are subject to the AMT in the carryback/joint return year, the spouse\u2019s\nallocation ratio must take into account their separate AMT income and AMT liability. Further, the procedures discussed in Part 2 of this document must be done to compute\na) the AMT NOL deduction to be used in the carryback year; b) the new joint AMT\nliability; and c) the amount of the AMT NOL absorbed in the carryback year. 6. Form 1045, Schedule B is used to compute the amount of the NOL absorbed in the\ncarryback year. In general, the loss spouse\u2019s separate modified taxable income is the 10\namount of NOL absorbed in the carryback year. Where, however, the joint modified\ntaxable income is smaller than the loss spouse\u2019s separate modified taxable income, the\namount of the NOL that is absorbed is equal to the modified joint taxable income. Legal Analysis\nSection 1.172-7 sets forth the treatment to be accorded spouses who filed a joint return\nin one or more of the taxable years involved in the computation of a NOL deduction. Those provisions, however, do not address situations where a NOL is carried to a joint\nreturn year if, as in the instant situation, the spouses are not married when the NOL is\nincurred. A number of revenue rulings and court cases address the use of a NOL incurred by a\nsingle taxpayer in a joint return year.",
