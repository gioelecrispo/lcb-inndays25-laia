    "text": "Reg. 1.861-10T(h), which establishes a 50% and not a 10%\nownership threshold for determining whether the TAXPAYER\nshould use the FMV of its investment vs. the FMV of the\nTAXPAYER\u2019s distributive share of another entity\u2019s assets\nfor interest apportionment. Thus, as interpreted by the TAXPAYER, the language of the\nregulation requires TAXPAYER to value its pro rata share of B\u2019s\nassets only if B is related to the TAXPAYER. The TAXPAYER argues\nthat since B is not related (as that term is defined) to\nTAXPAYER, it cannot be required to reflect its pro rata share of\nB\u2019s assets as part of the its assets. Instead, TAXPAYER suggests\nthat its \u201casset\u201d for purposes of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii)\nis its P interest in the B partnership. We believe that the TAXPAYER\u2019s interpretation of the\nregulations is incorrect. In applying the FMV methodology, we\nbelieve that minority interests held by the TAXPAYER, including a CC:LM:HMT:CIN:1:POSTF-168001-03 Page 8 ten-percent-corporate partnership interest, should be considered\na tangible asset under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii). When\napportioning interest expense incurred by the partnership, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(e)(2) requires a 10 percent corporate partner to\napportion such interest on the basis of all its assets, including\nits pro rata share of the partnership assets. Thus, in\napportioning its partnership-generated interest expense, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(e)(2) applies, in tandem with Treas. Reg. \u00a7\n1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii), to require the ten percent corporate partner\nto look through and take into account its proportionate share of\nthe gross assets of the partnership. Although the regulations may not explicitly address whether\nthe section 1.861-9T(e)(2) gross asset rule applies for purposes\nof apportioning the other interest expense of U.S. partner, the\npolicy of the FMV methodology and the treatment of partnerships\nunder the regulations indicate that the gross asset rule should\nalso apply in apportioning other (non-partnership incurred)\ninterest expense of a 10 percent corporate partner. The FMV methodology is based on the premise that interest\nexpense is spread against all of the taxpayer\u2019s income-generating\nassets. Asset value is essentially a surrogate for a taxpayer\u2019s\ntotal income generating ability. Such valuation suggests that\ntangible assets be valued on a gross, rather than a net basis. Accordingly, from a FMV methodology standpoint, substantial\npartnership interests should be included in the interest\napportionment process on a gross basis. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii) treats minority (less then\n50 percent) interests in corporations as passive (dividend\npaying) interests. The regulation generally values the stock\ninterest (using the capitalized earnings model) on a net or\nequity basis. Similarly, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(4) also\nvalues related party stock on a net-of-liabilities or equity\nbasis. Thus, in the case of corporations, asset look-through\ngenerally does not occur below 80 percent ownership. However, under the regulations, partnerships are treated\ndifferently than corporations. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(e)(1)\nprovides that look-through is the general rule. Treas. Reg. \u00a7\n1.861-9T(e)(4), an exception to the general rule, applies the\nentity (non-look through) approach to interests of a less-than10-percent partner. Thus, in the partnership area, the lookthrough occurs at the ten percent mark and above. Passive/equity\ntreatment occurs below the 10 percent cut off. Accordingly, in\nvaluing a ten-percent-or-more corporate partnership interest\nunder Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii), equity valuation should CC:LM:HMT:CIN:1:POSTF-168001-03 Page 9 not apply.",

    "text": "Thus, a NOL is considered to be absorbed to\nthe extent of modified taxable income in the carryback/carryover year. Modified taxable\nincome is taxable income computed by ignoring any excess of capital losses over\ncapital gains, the \u00a7 1202 exclusion, and the personal exemption deduction. Further,\nmodified taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL for the loss year or for 5\nany taxable year thereafter, and the taxable income so computed shall not be\nconsidered to be less than zero. Finally, \u00a7 172(b)(3)(C) allows a taxpayer to make an irrevocable election to relinquish\nthe entire carryback period and carry forward the NOL to the taxable years following the\nloss year. Illustration and Analysis (NOL not fully absorbed in a carryback year): The following example illustrates the manner in which a NOL is carried back to offset\nincome in the carryback year. Further, the example includes a NOL absorption\ncomputation. Please note that the example is intended to demonstrate the principles of\n\u00a7 172 only and, therefore, intentionally ignores all deductions (including the personal\nexemption deduction) except the \u00a7 213 medical expense deduction. Year 1: Assume a taxpayer has gross income of $1,000 and incurs medical expenses\nof $275. The taxpayer reports the following taxable income when completing his return\nand makes timely payments of tax. Gross income $1,000 Adjusted gross\nincome 1,000 Medical expense\ndeduction 200 (limited to the extent to which the expense ($275) exceeds\n7.5% of AGI ($75)) Taxable income 800 Year 2: The taxpayer has taxable income of $1,000. Year 3: The taxpayer incurs a NOL of $1,500. Taxpayer makes no election to forego\nthe carryback of the NOL and thus must carry the NOL back 2 years to offset the\nincome in Year 1. Recomputed Year 1 taxable income:\nGross income $1,000 Net operating loss\ndeduction (1,500) Adjusted gross\nincome\nMedical expense (500) 6\ndeduction (275) (the deduction is not limited because the AGI, taking into\naccount the NOL deduction, is a negative amount) Taxable income (775) The taxpayer is thus entitled to a refund of all the taxes paid for Year 1. The taxpayer next must compute the amount of the $1,500 net operating loss that was\nabsorbed in Year 1 and thus that may be carried to Year 2. Under \u00a7 172(b)(2), the\namount of the NOL absorbed in Year 1 is equal to the Year 1 modified taxable income\n(taxable income computed with certain modifications set forth in section 172(d)). Further, modified taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL for the loss\nyear of any year thereafter. NOL absorption computation - Year 1\nGross income $1,000 Adjusted gross\nIncome 1,000 Medical expense\ndeduction (200) (the deduction is again limited because AGI is $1,000) Modified taxable\nincome 800 The $1,500 NOL is reduced by the $800 Year 1 modified taxable income leaving $700\nto be carried to Year 2 to offset the Year 2 income. Recomputed Year 1 Taxable income - IRM Method: As discussed above, I.R.M. Section 21.5.9.5.9 provides that in a carryback year in\nwhich a NOL is not fully absorbed, the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income and taxable\nincome should be reduced by the modified taxable income amount shown on Schedule\nB, Form 1045.",

    "text": "The state may pursue treble damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and interest, but may not pursue\nrecovery that would duplicate recovery already granted in a prior suit. Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15e,\nthe monetary relief that an attorney general recovers from a federal anti-trust suit may either be\ndistributed at the court\u2019s discretion, or deemed a civil penalty and distributed at the attorney\ngeneral\u2019s discretion. State X Law1 outlaws any contract to restrain trade. State X\u2019s statute is understood by\nthe courts to bar most price-fixing activities. See, e.g., State X Case1. State X Law2 allows the\nstate attorney general to bring suit for violations of the State X anti-trust act. The statute allows PREF-123891-07\n5\nfor recovery of up to $50,000 for each act of restraint of trade, as well as injunctive relief. State\nX Law3 allows a penalty of up to $1,000,000 for violating the act. State X Law4 clarifies that\nthe penalties in the act are cumulative. State Y Law1 outlaws and voids any contract which interferes in the free exercise of\nbusiness activity by restraining competition. As with State Y and Federal law, the courts\nunderstand that State Y anti-trust law bars price-fixing. See, e.g., State Y Case1. State Y Law2\nallows the state Attorney General to bring an action against corporations that have entered into\narrangements that violate the state anti-trust act. The statute allows for a penalty of up to\n$20,000 beyond damages awarded. State Z Law1 outlaws contracts that unreasonably restrain trade. The comments from the\nState Z Bar on this law state that it prohibits vertical price fixing agreements; however, they also\nstate that a court must examine the purposes and consequences of an agreement before\nconcluding that it has the effect of restraining trade. State Z Law2 empowers the state attorney\ngeneral to bring action against companies and individuals found to be in violation of the act, and\nto seek damages, attorney fees, and treble damages if the restraint of trade is found to be willful. This statute also allows the State Z Attorney General to sue based on federal anti-trust law. State Z law has a provision that explicitly bans price fixing (State Z Law3), but this is\nmeant as a ban on non-competition, horizontal price fixing, not vertical price fixing. State Z law\nalso has a provision that allows the state attorney general to seek up to $1,000,000 in fines, but\nnot on a charge of vertical restraint of trade agreements. Discussion The question is whether the $amount1 that Taxpayer paid to the three plaintiff states\nshould be considered an ordinary business expense or a non-deductible penalty. The answer to PREF-123891-07 6\nthis question turns on whether the payment was meant to cover the actual damages that the\nplaintiff states allegedly incurred through the defendant\u2019s conduct, or if the payment is meant to\nbe a punitive measure to discourage future anti-competitive behavior. The settlement document does not explicitly allocate the money into one category or the\nother. However, the Federal statute as well as the State X statute that the suit invoked speak only\nof fines, not of damages.",
