    "text": "Constructive Dividends to the Insured Stockholders When an individual shareholder receives an economic benefit through a\ndiversion of corporate earnings and profits, such receipt may be taxed as a constructive\ndividend. Sachs v. Com-missioner, 277 F.2d 879, 882 (8th Cir. 1960) cert. denied, 364\nU.S. 833 (1960). Where a corporation pays premiums on an indi-vidual life insurance\npolicy on the life of a corporate officer/ sole stockholder, and the officer is permitted to\ndesignate the beneficiary, and the corporation is not directly or indirectly benefited by\nthe payments, those premium payments constitute income to the insured officer as they\nare paid. Yeungling v. Commissioner, 69 F.2d 971, 972 (3d Cir. 1934); Treas. Reg. POSTF-106186-02 8 \u00a7 1.61-2(d)(2)(ii)(a). Here, however, the named beneficiary on the life insurance\npolicies is the trustee. In the case of Prunier v. Commissioner, 248 F.2d 818 (1st Cir. 1957), life\ninsurance premiums similar to those within were found not to constitute income to the\ninsured shareholder when it was determined that the true beneficial owner of the\npolicies was the corporation. The above issue was directly addressed in Rev. Rul. 59184, 1959-1 C.B. 65. In that matter, the named benefi-ciary was a trustee obligated to\nreacquire the corporation's shares from the decedent stockholder's estate. Whenever a corporation purchases life insurance on the lives of its\nstockholders, the proceeds of which are to be used in payment for the\nstock of any stock-holder, the premiums on such insurance do not constitute income to any stockholder ... if such right of the beneficiary to receive\nthe proceeds is conditioned upon the transfer of the corporate stock to the\ncorporation. Rev. Rul. 59-184. Accord, Sanders v. Fox, 253 F.2d 855 (10th Cir. 1958), Casale v.\nCommissioner, 247 F.2d 440 (2d Cir. 1957). Interestingly, in Rev. Rul. 59-184, the insured stock-holders' heirs were not the\nnamed beneficiaries of the insurance policies. The designated beneficiaries were\ntrustees of an insurance trust who, by agreement with the corporation, were obligated to\ncollect the insurance proceeds and pay those pro-ceeds to the heirs of the deceased\nstockholders in return for the corporate stock. Nevertheless, the revenue ruling goes so\nfar as to hold that even when the insured stockholders have the right to designate the\nbeneficiaries of the life insurance policies, no constructive dividends result from the\ncorporation's payment of the premiums, so long as the beneficiaries must surrender the\ncorporate stock in order to receive the life insurance proceeds. Since this ruling directs that no constructive dividend results when the\ncorporation pays life insurance premiums for its stockholders where the beneficiaries\nnamed in the policies can be the insured stockholders's designees, provided those\nproceeds are to be used to reacquire the corporation's stock, it is plain that where the\ncorporation itself is the beneficiary under the life insurance policy, no constructive\ndividend arises from the pre-mium payments. Admittedly, the policies herein reflect the\ntrustee as the ostensible beneficiary, but as shown in LTR 6508270960A and Rev. Rul.\n59-184, the corporation will be deemed the ultimate beneficiary.",

These affidavits state that the a\nfacilities were substantially constructed as designed and that\neach facility operated in excess of Duration during the\ninspection, but do not describe the level of review of the\ndesign that Consultant undertook. Consultant\u2019s affidavits also CC:LM:NR:----Page 9\nstate that no mechanical failure was observed during each\nDuration period. Consultant did not opine as to whether any\nfacility was capable of sustained daily operations. The taxpayers also produced many photographs documenting\nconstruction of the facilities during the Timeframe 3 period. The initial photographs show the fabrication of the equipment\noff-site. Later photos show this equipment at the Facility\nLocation. Photographs accompanying a affidavits prepared by\nConsultant show the operation of several parts of the\nfacilities. The photographs included with the Consultant\naffidavits have descriptions of what is shown. Records provided by the taxpayers reflect inconsistent\ninformation concerning the production between Date 5 and Date 6. An affidavit by u states that w tons of synfuel were produced\nbetween Date 5 and Date 6. Spreadsheets showing production\nreflect an aggregate production of w tons of product for this\ntime frame1. u\u2019s affidavit states that the production total was\ndivided equally among the a facilities, but does not make clear\nthat this accurately reflects the actual production at each\nfacility. Other documents state that the material was run\nthrough the facilities n times. This coincides with records\nthat show that k had only delivered x tons of coal by Date 92. One of the contractor\u2019s documents stated that the material was\nused for aa. Finally, other documents indicate that ab tons of\nmaterial was processed, of which amount ac tons were sold to k\nin Month 10. The question of what was sold is discussed below. Additionally, the taxpayers provided the affidavit of ad of\nc. This affidavit states that the facilities were placed in\nservice prior to July 1, 1998, subject to completion of the ae. However, here again, there is no assertion that the facilities\nwere in a state of readiness sufficient to produce qualified\nfuel on a sustained and reliable basis in commercial quantities. More important, as is described below, ae involves equipment\nintegral to the facility. The taxpayers provided copies of n separate certifications\nof completion, containing nearly identical language.

Gasper\nGeneral Attorney (Dallas)\n(Large Business & International)\nJack Squyres\nTeam Coordinator (Team 1244)\n(Large Business & International) from: subject: Charles V. Dumas\nAttorney (Detroit)\nMotor Vehicle Industry Counsel\n(Large Business & International) Deductibility of Purportedly Worthless Goodwill This memorandum responds to your request for assistance. This advice may not be\nused or cited as precedent. LEGEND\nDealer\nManufacturer\nW\nX\nY1\nY2\nZ\nDate1\nDate2\nDate3 =\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n= ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ $39x\n$4x = --------------= ------------- ISSUE\nManufacturer terminated Dealer\u2019s franchise rights to sell W and Y2 automobiles,\nand Dealer argues the goodwill allocated to those franchises became worthless. May\nDealer deduct, as purportedly worthlessness, the goodwill associated with those\nfranchises? CONCLUSIONS Even if the goodwill associated with the W and Y2 franchises became worthless\nwhen Manufacturer terminated the franchise agreements, section 197(f)(1) of the\nInternal Revenue Code1 prohibits a deduction for worthless amortizable section 197\nintangibles, including goodwill, where other amortizable section 197 intangibles\npurchased as part of the same transaction or series of transactions remain. The\namount of any worthless amortizable section 197 intangibles instead is included in the\nbasis of the remaining amortizable section 197 intangibles. FACTS Dealer sells and services Manufacturer\u2019s products pursuant to franchise\nagreements. On Date1, Dealer purchased certain assets of another auto dealer; this\nsale included $39x for goodwill related to franchise rights to sell (including parts) and\nservice W, X, Y1, Y2, and Z automobiles. Although Dealer claims that $4x of goodwill\nwas allocated to the W franchise purchase, we see nothing in the contract that makes\nany such allocation. The information provided to you by Dealer is an unsigned, undated\nsummary. We cannot tell who prepared this summary, when it was prepared, or for\nwhat purpose. On Date2, Dealer received notice that Manufacturer was terminating its franchise\nto sell W products. Later, on Date3, Dealer also received notice that Manufacturer was\nterminating its Y2 franchise. In consideration for these franchise terminations and\nDealer\u2019s covenants, releases, waivers, and transfer to Manufacturer of a non-exclusive\nright to use Dealer\u2019s customer lists and service records, Dealer received from\nManufacturer payment of approximately 1.8% of $39x.2 Dealer therefore claims that the\ngoodwill associated with its terminated W and Y2 franchises became worthless on\nDate2 and Date 3, respectively. 1 Unless otherwise noted, references to \u201csection\u201d refer to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended. 2 The tax treatment of the amounts Dealer received as consideration for the W and Y2 franchise\nterminations is not in dispute in this case. See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 2007-37, 2007-1 C.B. 1390. LAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 165(a) allows a deduction for any loss sustained during the taxable year\nand not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The amount of any such deduction\nis subject to any provision of the Code that prohibits it or limits the amount. Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.165-1(a).\nSection 197(a) allows a taxpayer to amortize an \u201camortizable section 197\nintangible\u201d ratably over a 15-year period. If an asset is an \u201camortizable section 197\nintangible,\u201d it is amortizable over a 15-year period, even if the asset might have a\ndifferent useful life. I.R.C. \u00a7 197(b).",

The suitability check will be limited to an inquiry\nregarding whether an applicant has engaged in any\nconduct that would justify suspension or disbarment\nof any practitioner under the provisions of this part\non the date the application is submitted, including\nwhether the applicant has engaged in disreputable\nconduct as defined in \u00a710.51. The application will\nbe denied only if the results of the compliance or\nsuitability check are sufficient to establish that the\npractitioner engaged in conduct subject to sanctions\nunder \u00a7\u00a710.51 and 10.52. (2) If the applicant does not pass the tax\ncompliance or suitability check, the applicant will\nnot be issued an enrollment or registration card or\ncertificate pursuant to \u00a710.6(b) of this part.
