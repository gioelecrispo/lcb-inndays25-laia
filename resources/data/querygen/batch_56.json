    "text": "26 This translation rule applied to taxes claimed as credits under either the cash method or the accrual\nmethod. 27\nGeneral Explanation of Tax Legislation Enacted in 1997, Part Two: Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. JCS28-97, Pt. 2 Title XI [hereinafter General Explanation]. 28\nI.R.C. \u00a7 986(a)(1)(B).\n22 POSTF-113176-10 7 Similarly, section 905(c)(1)(B) provides that, if accrued taxes are not paid before\nthe date two years after the close of the taxable year to which the taxes relate, a foreign\ntax redetermination results. Taxes paid before that date are treated as paid in the year\nto which they relate and no redetermination of U.S. tax is required. The legislative\nhistory and the statute both provide that, \u201c[i]n the case of the direct foreign tax credit,\nany such taxes subsequently paid are taken into account for the taxable year to which\nsuch taxes relate\u2026,\u201d29 although translated at the spot rate on the date of payment. Thus, consistent with Cuba and Revenue Ruling 58-55, taxes paid either within or after\ntwo years after the close of the taxable year to which they relate are considered to\naccrue in the year to which they relate, not in the year in which they are paid. The application of the relation-back doctrine therefore prevents the double\ntaxation of foreign-source income. Otherwise, if the foreign tax accrued for purposes of\nthe credit in the year the liability was finally determined, then the credit would not be\ntaken in the year when the income was earned and subject to double taxation. Such a\ncontrary result would thwart the purpose of the credit. Consistent with the IRS\u2019s position in Revenue Ruling 58-55, in the instant case, ----------------accrued the -----------withholding taxes in --------when the -----------contest\nwas resolved and the taxes were paid. But for purposes of the foreign tax credit, the\naccrual related back to --------and -------, the years for which the taxes were assessed. C. -------------- may not claim the foreign tax credits on its amended --------return. In its rebuttals, ---------------relied on Revenue Ruling 58-55, as well as United\nStates v. Campbell,30 to support its position that the credits may be taken on its\namended --------return, rather than the returns for the years to which the taxes related. Based on these authorities, it argued that, because the foreign taxes accrued in -------,\nthe foreign tax credits may be taken in -------. But in analyzing these authorities, ------------------------took statements out of context and failed to read the respective authorities\nas a whole. In discussing Revenue Ruling 58-55, ---------------dismissed the application of the\nrelation-back doctrine and ignored the remaining contents of the ruling. It only focused\non the statement that the accrual \u201ccannot be made until the . . . liability is finally\ndetermined. \u201d31 On this basis, it asserted that it could claim the credits on its amended ---------return. But the sentence preceding this statement provided: \u201cA foreign tax for the\npurpose of such credit is accruable for the taxable year to which it relates even though\nthe taxpayer contests the liability therefor and such tax is not paid until a later year.\u201d32\nIn the instant case, --------was not the taxable year to which the -----------withholding\n29",

    "text": "POSTF-123043-08 9 tax liability is under the jurisdiction of the Service. The enforcement mechanism with\nrespect to section 218 agreements is also with the Service because the payments under\nthe agreements are treated as FICA taxes. While the Social Security Administration is the final arbiter of coverage issues related to\nsection 218 agreements, we note that the -------- section 218 agreement contains no\nexclusions for employees hired after -------. We point out that only the Medicare portion\nof FICA taxes would be applied in the present case under the section 218 agreement\nbecause the applicable section 218 agreement is limited to Medicare-only. Determining\nwhether the social security tax portion is owed depends on whether the workers are\nmembers of the state retirement system. See section 3121(b)(7)(F). We note that\neligible employees of --------- are covered by the state retirement system, but it is likely\nthat seasonal employees, such as -------panelists, might not be eligible for coverage\nunder the state retirement system. 9\nB. Is the Common Law Test Applicable? If the -------members are covered by the Medicare-only section 218 agreement, there is\na question concerning whether an individual covered under a Medicare-only 218\nagreement is an employee for purposes of social security tax. Section 3121(d)(4)\nprovides that \"for purposes of this chapter, the term \"employee\" means any individual\nwho performs services that are included under an agreement entered into pursuant to\nsection 218 of the Social Security Act. The chapter referred to is chapter 21- Federal\nInsurance Contributions Tax Act which imposes social security tax and Medicare tax on\nemployers and employees. Section 3121(d)(4) also does not provide that the term\n\u201cemployee\u201d excludes an individual who performs services that are included under a\nMedicare-only 218 agreement . Thus, if the -------members are covered under the Section 218 agreement, they are\n\u201cemployees\u201d for purposes of the social security tax under section 3121(d)(4) because\nfor purposes of Chapter 21 they perform services that are included under an agreement\nentered into pursuant to section 218 of the Social Security Act. Consequently, you do\nnot need to make an independent determination under the common law rules under\nsection 3121(d)(2) for determining the status of an individual as an employee for social\nsecurity tax purposes. However, if it is determined that the ------ members are not\ncovered by the Medicare-only 218 agreement, then the common law rules described in\nthe following paragraphs apply. Section 31.3121(d)-1 of the Employment Tax Regulations describe the common law\nrules applicable in determining whether a worker is an employee. See also Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 31.3121(d)-1(c)(1). Such a relationship exists when the person for whom services are\nperformed has the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services,\nnot only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and\n9 We do not opine in this memorandum on the issue of whether or not the ------ members are covered by\nthe state retirement system. POSTF-123043-08 10 means by which that result is accomplished. It is not necessary that the employer\nactually direct or control the manner in which the services are performed; It is sufficient\nif he has the right to do so. Treas.

    "text": "Because the contracts in question are cost-plus contracts, the liabilities incurred\nduring the taxable year under these contracts are included in claims incurred\nunder section 833(b)(1)(A)(i) in determining the special deduction under section\n833(b). It should be emphasized that the \"cost-plus\" contracts described in the TAM are\nvery similar to the underwritten \"Cost Plus/Administrative Services Only\" arrangements\ndescribed in the 1994 financial reporting supplement for BCBS plans prepared by the\nFinancial Reporting Working Group of the Special Committee on Blue Cross Plans, and\nin the description of ASC/Cost Plus arrangements by the BCBSA in its risk-based\ncapital formula. In all three cases, the plan issues an identification card, subscribers\nreceive services directly from health-care providers without making any payment, the POSTU-144536-09 24 plan pays the providers from plan funds, and the plan then bills the account for the cost\nof benefits. Note also that both the cost-plus arrangement described by the Financial\nReporting Working Group and by the TAM included a stop-loss feature, while both the\narrangement described by the Working Group and by the BCBSA were experiencerated. Both the arrangement described by the BCBSA and by the TAM allowed\nsubscribers to convert from group to individual coverage. Finally, note that the Taxpayer in the TAM established claims reserves for\nits \"cost-plus contracts\" but not for its ASO arrangements, and that the Taxpayer in the\nTAM did include its \"cost-plus\" business in computing the section 833(b) deduction, but\ndid not include ASO contracts. In summary, the NAIC first used the phrase \"Cost-Plus/ASO\" in 1994 to describe\n\"underwritten\" cost-plus arrangements, as opposed to arrangements that were\nconsidered nonunderwritten, which were described by the single term \"ASO.\" During\nthis same period, the BCBSA used the phrase \"ASC/Cost-Plus\" to describe an\narrangement similar to the NAIC's \"Cost-Plus/ASO\" arrangement, and the BCBSA\nsimilarly contrasted its \"ASC/Cost-Plus\" with \"ASO arrangements.\" Presently, the NAIC uses the terms \"ASO\" and \"ASC\" to describe two types of\narrangements that are considered \"uninsured.\" To the extent the term \"ASC\" was at\none time used to describe a \"cost-plus\" arrangement, it was used by the BCBSA to\ndescribe an arrangement that was considered insurance at the time. Accordingly, the\nfact that the NAIC now uses the term \"ASC\" to describe an arrangement that is\nconsidered uninsured does not mean that such an arrangement should be considered\n\"cost-plus.\" NAIC Risk-Based Capital Rules. Current NAIC Risk-Based Capital materials\nregarding ASO and ASC arrangements generally follow the descriptions of the NAIC\naccounting materials. There is no definition or discussion of \"National Account\"\narrangements or \"National Account-type\" arrangements and no inference can be drawn\nfrom the RBC line entry description for \"Fee-for service\" items. \"Risk-based capital (RBC)\" is described by the NAIC as \"a method of measuring\nthe minimum amount of capital appropriate for a reporting entity to support its overall\nbusiness operations in consideration of its size and risk profile.\" National Association of\nInsurance Commissioners, Risk-Based Capital Forecasting, Health, 2008 (2008 NAIC\nHealth, Risk-Based Capital Report, Including Overview and Instructions for Companies,\nas of December 31, 2008), page i. It should be emphasized that, unlike the NAIC\nAnnual Statement and the Federal Income Tax Return, Risk-Based Capital is not\nconcerned with the determination of income in any way.",
