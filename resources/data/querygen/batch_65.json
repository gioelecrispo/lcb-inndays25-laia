    "text": "These\nrequirements are discussed below. A. \"Taking\" of Rights in Private Property For purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 1033, a taking by governmental authority may include\nthe regulation against otherwise lawful use of private property in order to effect a public\npurpose. Courts have recognized two categories of regulatory action that are\ncompensable: (1) an action that effects a permanent physical \"invasion\" of the property,\nand (2) an action that denies all economically beneficial or productive use of the\nproperty. Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1015 (1992). However, a taking as a result of the exercise of governmental police powers will not\nqualify as an involuntary conversion. E.g., Rev. Rul. 58-11, 1958-1 C.B. 273 (a\ntaxpayer's court-ordered disposition of stock, the ownership of which was in violation of\nthe Sherman Anti-Trust Act, does not constitute a taking for public use for purposes of\nI.R.C. \u00a7 1033); and Rev. Rul. 57-314, 1957-2 C.B. 523 (the sale of rental properties in\norder to avoid compliance with building, fire, and health code requirements, even\nthough failure to comply would result in the owner's loss of the legal right to rent such\nproperties, does not fall within I.R.C. \u00a7 1033). The FCC, as part of its regulation of spectrum to promote the general public\ninterest, reallocates spectrum to other purposes and relicenses the use of allocated\nspectrum among both public and private users. The Communications Act of 1934 (\u201cthe\nAct\u201d) provides that the Act\u2019s purpose is, among other things, \u201cto provide for the use of\nsuch channels, but not the ownership thereof, by persons for limited periods of time, CC:LM:CTM:LA:2:POSTF-108806-08 page 5 under license granted by Federal authority, and no such license shall be construed to\ncreate any right, beyond the terms, conditions, and periods of the license.\" 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\n301 (2005). The Act also provides that any station license or construction permit may\nbe modified by the Commission either for a limited time or for the duration of the term\nthereof, if in the judgment of the Commission such action will promote the public\ninterest, convenience, and necessity. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(a)(1). Therefore, the FCC's\nreallocation of spectrum for other uses and the relicensing of such spectrum to new\nlicensees is in itself a regulatory act that does not result in a conversion of any private\nproperty rights of the licensee in the license or the spectrum. However, the reallocation\nof spectrum in the present case also has resulted in the condemnation of the broadcast\nstation's related equipment. The Communications Act of 1934 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) provides, in part, that the FCC may\nmake reasonable regulations governing the interference potential of devices which, in\ntheir operation, are capable of emitting radio frequency energy by radiation, conduction,\nor other means in sufficient degree to cause harmful interference to radio\ncommunications. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 302(a). The Act further provides that the FCC may make\nsuch regulations not inconsistent with law as it may deem necessary to prevent\ninterference between stations and to carry out the provisions of this Act. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\n303(f).",

This advice is subject to 15-day post-review by the National Office. CCDM\n33.1.2.3.2. In accordance with IRC \u00a76110(k)(3), this advice should not be cited as\nprecedent. POSTF-118789-08 2 ISSUE\nWhether Taxpayer properly accrued its liability for annual license fees under an\nagreement for rights to telecast sporting events as they occurred over a multi-year term\neven though the fees were payable in installments, some of which were due in the\nfollowing tax year? CONCLUSIONS After reviewing the agreements and applicable authorities, we conclude that Taxpayer\nproperly accrued its annual license fee liabilities as the sporting events occurred and it\nwas entitled to telecast the games, that is, when the liabilities were fixed, and economic\nperformance occurred. FACTS Taxpayer, an accrual-basis taxpayer, is a television network and cable/satellite\nprogramming provider, which transmits television programming to local television\nstations for broadcast to television viewers and to cable and satellite operators for\ndistribution to subscribers. Taxpayer uses a fiscal year ending Date 1. Taxpayer\nentered into three contracts (\u201ctelecast contracts\u201d) with Sports Associations,\nunincorporated, non-profit associations of Teams that oversee and produce\ninterscholastic sporting events for their members. The telecast contracts each grant -------------exclusive rights to telecast, on a live or\ndelayed basis, a specified number of Sport 1 or Sport 2 games per Operating year\n(beginning on Date 2) as well as rights to telecast additional sporting events (for\nexample, Sport 3). Taxpayer agrees to telecast the Sport 1 or Sport 2 games on a\nnational or regional basis and to pay annual fees in installments due over the Operating\nyear before, during and following the respective sports season. Two of the contracts\nprovide for final annual fee installments to be paid in the fiscal year following the\nseason, on Date 3 and Date 4, respectively. None of the telecast contracts call for\ninstallments to be made in fiscal years prior to a respective sports season. A season\u2019s\ngames are played entirely within a single fiscal year since the Sport 1 season runs from\nSeptember through January and the Sport 2 season runs from November through\nMarch of an Operating year. The telecast contracts are for terms from seven to ten\nyears in length. For tax purposes, Taxpayer accrues the entire annual fee for rights to telecast a\nseason\u2019s games in the year the games are played and most of the installments are due,\neven though some installments are not due until the subsequent year.

    "text": "Second, that the NAIC's Risk-Based Capital rules equate ASC and\n\"Fee-for service\" arrangements. And third, that the NAIC's Risk-Based Capital rules\nconsider \"Program X-type\" arrangements as Fee-for service. According to the\nTaxpayer:\n\"Program X-type\" arrangements = Fee-for service = ASC = Cost-plus. It should be emphasized that the \"special deduction\" under I.R.C. \u00a7 833(b) is\nsolely a creation of the Internal Revenue Code, for the purpose of allowing nonprofit\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield organizations to accumulate \"surplus\" equal to one-quarter\nof their annual claims payments. There is no comparable item in the NAIC Annual\nStatement, or in the NAIC Risk-Based Capital Report. With respect to items of income, expenses, and reserves the NAIC Annual\nStatement includes many items that are comparable to items shown on the Federal\nIncome Tax Return. With respect to the section 833(b) special deduction there is none. The Taxpayer's attempt to equate ASC arrangements under the NAIC, and cost-plus\narrangements under the I.R.C., is at best inconclusive. POSTU-144536-09 12 The Taxpayer's Risk-Based Capital Report argument depends on a line-item\ndescription for a particular risk factor. The RBC instructions show that the items\nincluded on that line are separate items. The fact that they are assigned the same risk\nfactor does not mean they are same type of arrangements. The Taxpayer's attempt to\nequate Fee-for service under the NAIC, and ASC under the NAIC, is generally\nirrelevant. \"Cost-plus\" and the NAIC. This is not the first time a dispute has arisen over\nthe meaning of the phrase \"cost-plus.\" The NAIC has addressed the issue in three\ncontexts: NAIC Annual Statement reporting; BCBS financial reporting; and risk-based\ncapital standards. When Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans began in the 1930's, they offered one\ncommunity rate. All subscribers, both in groups and individuals, paid a uniform rate\nregardless of individual health status. General Accounting Office, Health Insurance:\nComparing Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans With Commercial Insurers GAO/HRD-86110 (July 1986), page 17. When coverage is sold to a particular group, the\n\"experience\" of that group may be different from the community as a whole. Accordingly, commercial insurance companies began offering \"experience-rated\"\npolicies, where premiums are based wholly or partially on the group's health experience. Id. at 17. In the 1950's, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans began offering their own\nexperience-rated products, which they called \"cost-plus\" since the subscription rates\nwere based on the group's total claims, plus an administrative charge. Robert\nCunningham III and Robert M. Cunningham, Jr., The Blues: A History of the Blue Cross\nand Blue Shield System (1997), pages 97-101.\na. NAIC Annual Statement Instructions. In September, 1983, the NAIC's\nAccounting Practices and Procedures Task Force appointed a study group to \"review,\ndefine and suggest accounting and reporting procedures for Administrative Services\nOnly/Cost-Plus and related business as it concerns accident and health benefits.\" NAIC\nProc. 1986-1 page 187. The study was not directed specifically at BCBS organizations\nbut considered ASO/Cost-Plus arrangements generally. Research done by the study group or members of the group confirmed that there\nare no consistent definitions for such terms as \"cost-plus.\" Nor is there\nconsistency in the classification of funding arrangements. Accounting varies\nfrom company to company. [Emphasis added.]",

Any unauthorized disclosure of\nthis writing may have an adverse effect on privileges, such as the attorney client privilege. If\ndisclosure becomes necessary, please contact this office for our views. This memorandum may\nnot be cited as precedent. This memorandum responds to your request for advice regarding designation of\na trust as a Tax Matters Partner (\u201cTMP\u201d) in a TEFRA partnership proceeding, and relies\non the facts provided by the Examination Team to our office. If you find that any of the\nfacts are incorrect, please advise us immediately so that we may modify and correct this\nadvice. I. ISSUE\nWhether certain partnerships may designate the ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------as the TMP for the tax year -------? II. FACTS The Service is examining approximately ----- domestic limited liability companies\n(treated as partnerships for Federal tax purposes) involved in a ------------------------ sale\nof -----------------------. The partnerships owned the ------------------------, and at the time of\nthe sale, -------------------- was a general partner and the TMP in each of the\npartnerships. 1 -------------------- passed away in -------------. Upon his death, the majority\n1 Most of the partnerships treated the ------- transaction as a sale of partnership interests (thus resulting in\na technical termination of the partnership), but some of the partnerships treated it as an asset sale. This\ndistinction does not affect the analysis of whether the partnerships may now designate a trust as the\nTMP. POSTSP-107553-10 2 of ----------------- property passed to the ---------------------------------------- (\u201cthe Trust\u201d). ---------------------------------, ----------------, is the trustee of the Trust. The partnerships want to\ndesignate the Trust as the TMP. III. APPLICABLE LAW\nSection 6231(a)(7)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cI.R.C.\u201d) defines the TMP\nas the general partner designated as the TMP as provided in the regulations. Treasury\nRegulation \u00a7 301.6231(a)(7)-1 states that a partnership may designate a partner as its\nTMP for a taxable year only as provided in section 301.6231(a)(7)-1. Further, the\ndesignation of a partner as a TMP for a taxable year may be terminated only as\nprovided in section 301.6231(a)(7)-1. If the designation is terminated without the\npartnership designating another general partner as the TMP, the TMP is the partner\ndetermined under section 301.6231(a)(7)-1. In general, a person may be designated as the TMP of a partnership for a\ntaxable year only if that person: (1) was a general partner in the partnership at some\ntime during the taxable year for which the designation is made; or (2) is a general\npartner in the partnership at the time the designation is made.

    "text": "The fact that final installment payments may be due in a\nsubsequent year does not prevent accrual in the year the games are played since POSTF-118789-08 4 Taxpayer\u2019s liability is fixed by the earlier of performance or payment being due. See\nRev. Rul. 80-230; Rev. Rul. 79-410. The amount of the liability can be determined with\nreasonable accuracy in the year the games are played. Economic performance with\nrespect to the annual fee liability also occurs in the year the games are played, ratably\non a game-by-game basis as Taxpayer is entitled to broadcast games. See \u00a7 1.4614(d)(3). The fact of the liability for the annual license fees was not established when Taxpayer\nexecuted the telecast contracts. It is well established that an accrual basis obligor is not\npermitted to deduct an expense stemming from a bilateral contractual arrangement, that\nis, mutual promises, prior to the performance by the obligee, whether performance of\nservices, delivery of goods or, as in this case, the availability of property for use by the\nobligor. Rev. Rul. 2007-3, 2007-1 C.B. 350 (holding that the mere execution of a\ncontract, without more, does not establish the fact of a taxpayer's liability) and Rev. Rul. 80-182, 1980-2 C.B. 167, citing Levin v. Commissioner, 21 T.C. 996 (1954), aff'd, 219\nF.2d 588 (3d Cir. 1955) (an agreement for subway advertising to be performed in the\nnext year did not establish the fact of the taxpayer's liability but was simply an\nagreement under which a liability would be incurred in the future) and Amalgamated\nHousing Corp. v. Commissioner, 37 B.T.A. 817 (1938), aff'd per curium, 108 F.2d 1010\n(2d Cir. 1940) (an agreement to renovate property in the future did not establish the fact\nof the taxpayer's liability; the accrual was for services in renovating, not the duty to\nrenovate). See also, Consolidated Foods Corp. v. Commissioner, 66 T.C. 436, 442-443\n(1976), (the signing of a 25-year lease agreement did not fix the lessee's liability for all\n25 years of lease payments). Thus, the mere execution of the telecast contracts by\nTaxpayer was not sufficient, by itself, to establish the fact of Taxpayer\u2019s liabilities for\nannual fees payable for rights to telecast games to be played in subsequent years. CONCLUSION Taxpayer\u2019s liabilities under the telecast contracts for annual license fees are incurred\nseason-by-season because the fact of liability is established as games are played and\nthe initial installments become due and economic performance occurs as Taxpayer is\nentitled to telecast the games.",

Reg. at 190-91. POSTF-147002-10 4 submitted, the Fund determines the actual BEA payment to be disbursed to each BEA\napplicant based upon the priority ranking for each category of qualifying activities and\nthe incremental increase in the value of such qualifying activities from the prior award\nyear. 12 CFR \u00a7 1806.203(d). The priority ranking for each category of qualifying\nactivities is described in the regulations and the NOFA. 12 CFR \u00a7 1806.203(c); 72 Fed.\nReg. at 194. The NOFA establishes priority factors for only the distressed community\nfinancing activities category. 72 Fed. Reg. at 194. The NOFA assigns a priority factor\nof 3.0 to affordable housing loans and small business loans. Id. The NOFA assigns a\npriority factor of 2.0 to affordable housing development loans and commercial real\nestate loans. Id. The priority factor is multiplied by the increase in the corresponding\nqualified activities from the prior award year to achieve a weighted value. Id. The\nweighted value is then multiplied by the appropriate award percentage to calculate the\nestimated BEA payment for the qualifying activities. During the years at issue, the estimated awards submitted by all BEA program\napplicants exceeded the actual funding. For the award years *** c and *** d, the award\npercentage for qualifying distressed community financing activities engaged in by\nTaxpayer during the years at issue was nine percent of the weighted value of the\nincrease in such qualifying activities from the prior award year. 72 Fed. Reg. at 194. For the award year *** d, the award percentage for support activities, including deposits\nand technical assistance to a community development financial institution, was eighteen\npercent of the value of the increase in the qualifying activity from the prior award year. Id.\nTerms and Conditions of the BEA Payment\nDuring *** c, the Fund made BEA payments of approximately $11 million to *** f\nbanks and thrifts across the country. During *** d, the Fund made BEA payments of\napproximately $20 million to *** g banks and thrifts across the country. During the\ntaxable years *** c and *** d, the BEA payments were not required to be used for any\nspecific purpose. The BEA payment is made in the form of a grant. 72 Fed. Reg. at 192. The BEA\npayment is unilaterally prescribed by the Fund. 12 CFR \u00a7 1806.203(f); 72 Fed. Reg. at\n192, 195.

    "text": "Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-1(c)(2), each payment shall be allocated\nbetween taxable gain and return of basis by applying the gross profit ratio computed for\nthe transaction. In general, the gross profit is the selling price less the seller\u2019s adjusted\nbasis (including expenses of sale). The gross profit factor (percentage) is the gross\nprofit divided by the contract price. Said gross profit factor is applied to the aggregate\ncontingent payment amounts received in each taxable period/year to arrive at the\nannual reportable gain, after allocation to interest, as discussed below. There are\nspecific rules for computing the initial selling price, contract price and gross profit. The\napplicable regulation section depends on whether the transaction constitutes a sale for\nwhich: (a) the maximum selling price is determinable, (b) the maximum selling price is\nnot determinable but the time over which payment will be received is determinable, or\n(c) neither a maximum selling price nor a definite term is determinable. Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-1(c)(1). Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the maximum selling\nprice is set in the operative documents so it is a determinable maximum as of the first\nyear of the contract. Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-1(c)(2)(i)(A). Whatever Corp F\u2019s\ncurrent speculation is as to how much will actually be paid, the regulations clearly\nprovide that the stated maximum selling price is determined by assuming all\ncontingencies are resolved in a manner that maximizes the price and accelerates\npayment. Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-1(b)(2). Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.4531(c)(2)(i)(B), Ex. (1) and (2). Applying these regulations, the selling price is $ DD, all obligations assumed by\nEntity M, all expenses of Corp F paid by Entity M and the working capital note which is 26 The taxpayer now, apparently, asserts no inventory was transferred. If inventory was transferred, it is\nexcluded from the installment sale provision. \u00a7 453(b)(2)(B); Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-(b)(4). See\nC.W. Murry v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1993-471 (the price of inventory had to be excluded from the\ninstallment method computation). Corp F cannot claim it purchased inventory, in bulk, from the\nbankruptcy proceeding as an investment for the purpose of turning over a profit given the assets were\nused in its trade or business. See W.F. Glisson v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1981-379 (the character of\nthe parts sold changed from inventory to investment assets based on the facts). Thus, all gain, if any,\nfrom inventory sales must be immediately recognized as ordinary income, with the income recognizable in\nYear 13 pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 481.

Corp F has overstated its basis in that the value of the retained W must be\nsubtracted from the claimed basis of $ T. The basis would be no more than $ R (the $ T\npurchase price paid for the assets ** months prior to the sale less the $ GG amount\nCorp F allocated to the retained W, assuming the allocation was not understated).",
