Rulon White Boulevard\nOgden, UT 84404\nAttn: Dan Bach, Campus Reporting Compliance\nShauna Henline, Senior Technical Advisor Frivolous Return Program, MS 4390 from: subject: Mark H. Howard, Senior Counsel (Salt Lake City)\n(Small Business/Self-Employed) Request for legal advice on procedures when dealing with frivolous business returns This memorandum responds to your request for assistance. This advice may not\nbe used or cited as precedent. ISSUES\n1. The Internal Revenue Service (the Service) currently imposes the I.R.C.\n\u00a7 6702 Frivolous Tax Submissions Penalty against the responsible individual when it\ndetermines that a business return is frivolous in nature and that individual is found to be\nresponsible for the filing. (a). Would it be appropriate to impose a penalty against both the business and\nthe responsible individual?\n(b). If the answer to question 1(a) is yes, would the two assessments be\nseparate liabilities of $5,000 each or would the two assessment be joint and several so\nthat the Service would collect a single penalty of $5,000?\n(c). If the Service determined that more than one person was responsible for the\nfiling of the frivolous business return, could it make a separate assessment under\nsection 6702 against each such person?\n(d). Would the answer to question 1(c) vary if the taxpayer had multiple officers\nor members? POSTN-119570-10/SCAF-106587-10 page 2 (e). Would the answer to question 1(c) vary if the return is signed or unsigned?\n(f). Would the Service need to apply different rules when dealing with a sole\nproprietorship as compared with a partnership or a limited liability company? If so, what would those rules or considerations be?\n(g). Would the Service need to apply different rules when dealing with an S\ncorporation as compared with a C corporation? If so, what would those rules or\nconsiderations be? 2. Are all liabilities for withholding taxes assessed without the application of a\nstatutory notice of deficiency procedure? For example, do the same procedures apply\nto backup withholding and Federal income tax withheld at the source? 3. Is the advanced earned income credit claimed on Forms 941, 943 and 9441\nsubject to statutory notice of deficiency procedures? Can this credit be reversed and\ndisallowed using math error procedures? 4. Is the following paragraph legally adequate as a proposed IRM paragraph to\ndeal with situations where the return claims an erroneous refund based on a false\ncredit? If the return was processed in error and a refund was issued, assess tax in the\namount of the false credit amount. If the false credit was withholding, no other\naction is necessary. If the credit is Advanced Earned Income Credit (AEIC,\nF2439) or any other credit that posts as TC7662, assess the amount as tax, but\nhold the case for 60 days to allow the filer to contest the assessment (like a math\nerror assessment.) In the event the assessment is disputed, a SNOD must be\ninitiated and must be forwarded to specialized BMF processing using Form 3210\nto M/S 4160, ATTN: Tina Decaria for field audit classification.

The Service now seeks to collect the balance due\non the taxpayers\u2019 account which includes the addition to tax for their failure to pay their\ntax liability. The Closing Agreement states that it \u201ccontains the complete agreement between the\nparties.\u201d Neither the Closing Agreement nor the Settlement Initiative address what\nwould occur if a taxpayer elected to participate in the Settlement Initiative and signed a\nclosing agreement with the Service, but failed to pay the tax in full. In the letter dated ------------------, the taxpayers\u2019 argue the Service is precluded from\ncollecting the failure to pay addition to tax because the Closing Agreement limits the\nService to assessing and collecting only the penalty specifically addressed in paragraph\n(8) and the Closing Agreement must be set aside before the Service can assess and\ncollect the failure to pay addition to tax. For the reasons stated below, the Service is\nable to assess and collect the addition to tax under I.R.C. \u00a7 6651 in addition to the\npenalty under I.R.C. \u00a7 6662 agreed upon in paragraph (8) of the Closing Agreement\nand without setting aside the Closing Agreement. LAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 7121(a) authorizes the Service to enter into closing agreements. If such agreement is approved by the Secretary . . . such agreement shall\nbe final and conclusive, and, except upon a showing of fraud or\nmalfeasance or misrepresentation of a material fact \u2013 (1) the case shall not\nbe reopened as to the matters agreed upon or the agreement modified by\nany officer, employee, or agent of the United States, and (2) in any suit,\naction, or proceeding, such agreement, or any determination, assessment,\ncollection, payment, abatement, refund, or credit made in accordance\ntherewith, shall not be annulled, modified, set aside, or disregarded.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7121(b) (emphasis added). Closing agreements are final as to the matters\ncontained within. The Service is not alleging fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation\nof material fact by the taxpayers and is not reopening the matters agreed upon in the\nClosing Agreement. The Service has assessed and is collecting the addition to tax\nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 6651 outside of the Closing Agreement. 1 It is unclear whether the addition to tax was assessed pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6651(a)(2) or I.R.C. \u00a7\n6651(a)(3). The analysis and conclusion stated in this memorandum is applicable regardless of which\nsubsection of I.R.C. \u00a7 6651 is applied.

LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with\nthe IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition,\nLITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak\nEnglish as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, see\nthe LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate.

Eligible\nindividuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance\ncompany. If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the\npremium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach\nForm 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year. The Marketplace is required to send Form 1095-A by January 31, 2023, listing the advance payments and other\ninformation you need to complete Form 8962. 1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace. 2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments. 3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR. (Don\u2019t include Form 1095-A.) Health Coverage Reporting If you or someone in your family was an employee in 2022, the employer may be required to send you Form\n1095-C. Part II of Form 1095-C shows whether your employer offered you health insurance coverage and, if\nso, information about the offer. You should receive Form 1095-C by early March 2023. This information may be\nrelevant if you purchased health insurance coverage for 2022 through the Health Insurance Marketplace and\nwish to claim the premium tax credit on Schedule 3, line 9. However, you don\u2019t need to wait to receive this form\nto file your return. You may rely on other information received from your employer. If you don\u2019t wish to claim the\npremium tax credit for 2022, you don\u2019t need the information in Part II of Form 1095-C.",

    "text": "11 Section 530 has since been modified to provide that application of section 530 is not dependent upon a\nfinding that the individual is otherwise an employee. See Section 530(e)(3). POSTF-123043-08 15 The legislative history in connection with section 530 implies that section 530 was\ndirected at reclassification controversies between the Internal Revenue Service and\ntaxpayers, and not reclassifications made by Social Security Administrators under\nsection 218 agreements. House Report 95-1748, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978), at page\n4, states that: The bill provides an interim solution for controversies between the Internal Revenue\nService and taxpayers involving whether certain individuals are employees under\ninterpretations of the common law\u2026 The bill provides relief from employment tax\nliability to certain taxpayers involved in employment tax status controversies with the\nInternal Revenue Service as a result of the Service's proposed reclassification of\nworkers, whom taxpayers have considered as having independent contractor status\nor some other status (e.g., customer), as employees. Although the legislative history was admittedly written when contributions under section\n218 agreements were not treated as FICA taxes, it nevertheless demonstrates the\nscope of Congressional concern. The reclassification of workers who are covered under section 218 agreements as\nemployees under section 3121(d)(4) of the Code should be contrasted with the\nreclassification of other state and local governmental workers. If the worker is not\ncovered under a section 218 agreement, the determination of his or her status as an\nemployee under the FICA will generally be made pursuant to section 3121(d)(2), which\nprovides that the term \u201cemployee\u201d includes an individual who is an employee under the\nusual common law rules. If the worker is an employee not covered under a section 218\nagreement, the services of the worker are then examined to determine whether the\nworker is a common law employee, as well as whether the services are \u201cemployment\u201d\nfor purposes of social security taxes and Medicare taxes, under sections 3121(b) and\n3121(u). 12 Because the question of whether workers who are not covered under section\n218 agreements are employees for purposes of the FICA is made under section\n3121(d)(2) and is within the jurisdiction of the Service, the employee-independent\ncontractor determination is ultimately made in the same manner as with private\nemployers. Therefore, with respect to employees not covered under section 218\nagreements, the argument about conflict with the section 218 agreement is inapplicable\nand section 530 relief for FICA taxes and income tax withholding can apply if the usual\nrequirements of section 530 are satisfied. In the present situation pertaining to the reclassification of -------workers possibly\ncovered under a Medicare-only 218 agreement, while a determination of coverage\n12 Section 3121(b)(7) excepts from \u201cemployment\u201d service in the employ of a state employer or political\nsubdivision employer for FICA tax purposes. However, \u00a7 3121(b)(7)(F) expands the definition of\nemployment for FICA tax purposes to include service by an employee who is not a member of a\nretirement system. Section 3121(u)(2) generally extends the Medicare portion of FICA tax to wages for\nservice performed by employees of states, political subdivisions, and wholly owned instrumentalities\nthereof hired after March 31, 1986.

    "text": "Corporation X was pursuing obtaining each ANDA as\npart of one overall transaction for FDA approval of each ANDA to be able to market and\nsell the new drugs the subject of each ANDA in the United States (e.g., license, permit,\nfranchise or similar right to market and sell its generic drugs in the United States). On\nan ANDA-by-ANDA basis Corporation X was seeking to obtain FDA-approved ANDAs\nby carrying out the series of steps required by the statutory and regulatory regime to\nobtain approval of its ANDAs. The steps included notifying the NDA holders and\npatentees of the filing of an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification, with that\ncertification necessitating outside counsels to research the patents. Once the NDA\nholders and patentees filed suit, Corporation X had to defend itself to obtain FDA\napproval of an ANDA effective before the expiration of the patents. Accordingly, the\nprofessional fees incurred in researching the paragraph IV certifications and\ninfringement litigation defense fees were incurred to facilitate obtaining governmentalgranted rights and thus must be capitalized. Alternatively, even if one could argue the fees did not directly facilitate obtaining the\nFDA-approved ANDAs, the fees would be an indirect payment relative to obtaining the\nANDAs that also must be capitalized, as were the attorney fees in the following\nexamples set forth in Treas. Reg. \u00a71.263(a)-4(l):\n(l) Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the following\nexamples in which it is assumed that the Internal Revenue Service\nhas not published guidance that requires capitalization under\nparagraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section (relating to amounts paid to\ncreate or enhance a future benefit that is identified in published\nguidance as an intangible for which capitalization is required):\nExample 1. License granted by a governmental unit. (i) X\ncorporation pays $25,000 to state R to obtain a license to sell\nalcoholic beverages in its restaurant. The license is valid\nindefinitely, provided X complies with all applicable laws regarding\nthe sale of alcoholic beverages in state R. X pays its outside\ncounsel $4,000 for legal services rendered in preparing the license\napplication and otherwise representing X during the licensing\nprocess. In addition, X determines that $2,000 of salaries paid to its\nemployees is allocable to services rendered by the employees in\nobtaining the license. POSTU-139175-10 44 (ii) X's payment of $25,000 is an amount paid to a governmental\nunit to obtain a license granted by that agency, as described in\nparagraph (d)(5)(i) of this section. The right has an indefinite\nduration and constitutes an amortizable section 197 intangible. Accordingly, as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the\nprovisions of paragraph (f) of this section (relating to the 12-month\nrule) do not apply to X's payment. X must capitalize its $25,000\npayment to obtain the license from state R.\n***\n(iv) X's payment of $4,000 to its outside counsel is an amount paid\nto facilitate the creation of an intangible, as described in paragraph\n(e)(1)(i) of this section. Because X's transaction costs do not\nexceed $5,000, X's transaction costs are de minimis within the\nmeaning of paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, X is\nnot required to capitalize the $4,000 payment to its outside counsel\nunder this section. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(l)(1)(emphasis added).",

    "text": "The PLR held 1) That the Coop\u2019s b payments to members and\nparticipating patrons constitute \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money\u201d within the\nmeaning of section 1382(b)(3) of the Code; and 2) For the purpose of computing its\nsection 199 domestic production activities deduction, Coop\u2019s qualified production\nactivities income and taxable income should, pursuant to section 199 (d)(3)(C) of the POSTF-143023-10 14 Code, be computed without regard to any deduction for b payments to members and\nparticipating patrons. In other words, all of Coop\u2019s b payments in cash to members and\nparticipating patrons for 20--- could be classified as \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in\nmoney\u201d and that they should be added back in its section 199 computation. We are cognizant that, the conclusion that cash payments by a non-poolingmarketing cooperative to the patrons (which is intended by the cooperative and the\nmembers to be purchase proceeds) meets the definition of a per-unit-retain paid-inmoney (PURPIM) under I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1388(f) and 1382(b)(3) is based on a number of\nrecent Private Letter Rulings including the one issued to the instant taxpayer for 20---. This opinion attempts to clarify the teaching of those rulings by making clear that even if\nb purchases meet the language of what a PURPIM is under I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1388(f) and\n1382(b)(3), this does not mean that you can have the same amounts considered to be\nPURPIMS and b sale/purchase consideration, at the same time, in any one specific\ntransaction or series of transactions. Although this opinion accepts as a given, the rulings of the PLR for taxpayer\u2019s\n20--- tax year, we do not extend these rulings to the 20--- tax year. The 20--- rulings are\nnot precedent for rulings applicable to the year 20---. In our opinion, the additional\nfactors that are considered for the year 20--- sufficiently distinguish the situation in this\nearlier year, from that present in the ruling for 20---, that a ruling similar to that for 20----would not have been issued for 20---. Further, if the facts for 20--- are not sufficiently distinguishable from those for 20-------, as we believe they are, then, we are of the opinion that, it is necessary to clarify,\nextent, or modify the teachings of the 20--- PLR and similar rulings to make it clear that\nclosed b sale proceeds are conceptually different from per unit retains paid in money. It\nneeds to be made clear that, even if a transaction may qualify as either a per unit retain\npaid in money or as closed purchase transaction, under the definition of per-unit retains\nin the Code, this does not mean that they are identical nor that the parties to the\ntransaction can have them be both, at once. The following discusses the difference\nbetween the two further. This opinion does not interpret the PLR, for the taxable year 20---, to have\nchanged, in any manner, the definition of \u201cper-unit retain allocation\u201d set forth in I.R.C.\n\u00a71388(f). What this opinion does is recognize that a necessary element of this definition\nis a mutual agreement between the Coop and the member/patron that the b purchase\nprice will be treated as a per-unit retain before it can be so classified.",
