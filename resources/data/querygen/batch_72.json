    "text": "402 F.3d at 1059, n.2. \u201cThe ANDA process allows the manufacturers of generic drugs to gain early entry into the market. HatchWaxman's truncated procedure avoids the duplication of expensive safety and efficacy studies, so long as\nthe generic manufacturer proves that its drug is bioequivalent to the already-approved brandname/pioneer drug. As part of the application process, the generic applicant must certify that the relevant\npatent(s) on the brand-name drug are either invalid or will not be infringed. This is commonly known as a\n\u2019Paragraph IV certification.\u2019 The patent holder is then notified of the ANDA, and if the patent holder sues\nfor infringement within forty-five days of receiving the notice, the FDA automatically institutes a thirtymonth delay on the generic manufacturer's ANDA approval. See 21 U.S.C. 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) .\u201d Id.\n70 \u201cThe Hatch-Waxman scheme distinguishes between New Drug Applications (NDAs) and Abbreviated\nNew Drug Applications (ANDAs). To seek FDA approval for a pioneer drug, the manufacturer must file a\ncomplete NDA. Such a filing must \u2018provide the FDA with a listing of all patents that claim the approved\ndrug or a method of using the drug.\u2019 aaiPharma Inc., 296 F.3d at 230. The NDA must also set forth data\nestablishing that the drug is safe and effective. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b). Later, a company that makes a\ngeneric drug that is biologically equivalent to the pioneer drug may seek FDA approval for the drug by\nfiling an ANDA. The ANDA relies on the pioneer drug's safety and effectiveness studies. See 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 355(j); aaiPharma Inc., 296 F.3d at 231.\u201d 454 F.3d at 272. \u201cThe ANDA must contain a certification as to whether the proposed generic drug would infringe the patent\nprotecting the pioneer drug, and if not, why not. Pertinent here is the fourth of the statute's four\ncertification options (the paragraph IV option), allowing the ANDA applicant to certify that the pioneer\ndrug's patent is \u2019invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the new drug for which\nthe application is submitted.\u2019 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). Thus, \u2019an ANDA applicant making a\nparagraph IV certification intends to market its product before the relevant patents have expired.\u2019\naaiPharma Inc., 296 F.3d at 232. The patent holder and the NDA holder (which usually are the same\ncompany, the pioneer drug maker) are entitled to notice that a paragraph IV ANDA has been filed. If,\nupon receiving such notice, the patent holder sues the applicant for patent infringement within 45 days,\nthe FDA must stay a decision on whether to approve the ANDA for 30 months (unless the patent expires\nor a court holds that it is invalid or not infringed during that time). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iii).\u201c Id.

Whether life insurance premium payments by a closely held corporation on\nthe lives of the corporation's officers, who were its shareholders, are deductible\nbusiness expenses of the corporation. 2. Whether the aforementioned premium payments constitute constructive\ndividends to the insured shareholders where the corporation paid the premiums,\nalthough both corporation and shareholders guaranteed the payment. 3. Whether the redemption of corporate stock from the estate of a deceased\ninsured stockholder, using proceeds of company owned life insurance, results in\nconstructive dividends to the continuing shareholders where no primary purchase\nobligation had been imposed upon the continuing shareholders. 4. Whether premium payments by the corporation for life insurance for one\nstockholder creates constructive dividends to the other shareholders where the\nproceeds of such policy are obligated for the reacquisition of the corporation's stock\nfrom the insured shareholder's estate. POSTF-106186-02 3 5. Whether the closely-held corporation and its retiring Chief Executive Officer\n(CEO), who was also a shareholder, entered into a valid deferred compensation\nagreement or disguised stock redemption. CONCLUSIONS 1. Premium payments for life insurance policies on the lives of the\nofficer/shareholders of a closely held corporation are not deductible business expenses. Firstly, the Code pre-cludes deduction under \u00a7 264 since the corporation was the\nprimary beneficiary of the stock reacquisition plan funded by the insurance proceeds. Secondly, since the payments are being used to fund the acquisition of a capital asset,\ntreasury stock, they do not constitute ordinary and necessary business expenses. Thirdly, IRC \u00a7 162(k) specifically precludes deduction for expenses by a corporation in\nconnection with the reacquisition of its stock. 2. Since the proceeds of the life insurance policies are obligated solely for the\nreacquisition of the corporation's stock from the decedent stockholder's estate, or that\nof any later surviving spouse, the corporation is a beneficiary of the plan. Under such\ncircumstance, no constructive dividend will be deemed to arise to the insured\nshareholder by the corporation's payment of the premiums. 3. Not being relieved of a primary obligation to purchase the shares of a\ndecedent shareholder, no constructive dividend occurs to the continuing shareholders\nupon the reacquisition of corporate stock from the decedent shareholder's estate\nfunded with company owned life insurance benefits. 4. Since no constructive dividends would arise to the continuing shareholders\nwhen the corporation reacquires the shares of a deceased shareholder using the\nproceeds of the applicable life insurance policy, no constructive dividends to those\nsame shareholders are generated as the premiums are being paid by the corporation.",

    "text": "The amount allocated to civil penalties was likely in lieu of the penalties that would\nhave been imposed due to the violation of --------------------------------------------------------- and -------------- Violation by -----------of these various state code sections was alleged in the various\nclaims by the ---------------managers included in the class action suit. We find that the penalties encapsulated in the violation of the various ----------------------Code\nsections may fall under the category of liquidated or punitive damages, as applied in Rev. Rul.\n72-268. The ruling found that, where amounts were required as a penalty for failure to comply\nwith the law, they could not be categorized as wages. In the present situation, the civil penalty\namounts may have been imposed based on the violation of ----------------------Code sections and,\ntherefore, may not be wholly reallocated to wages. Additionally, the settlement agreements\nwere not silent on the amount of the total award that was allocated to the civil penalties, instead\nstating that a third of the total settlement amount was allocated to that category. As such, the\nfacts of 1996 FSA LEXIS 244 are not directly on point with the facts in the present case. However, as mentioned in the prior section regarding whether the IRS is bound by settlement\nallocations, we believe that the -----amount of the settlement payment allocated to civil penalties\nwas not the proper amount. Any portion of that allocation that the taxpayer can show directly\ncorresponded with penalty amounts under the ----------------------Code should be respected as a\nproper allocation. The --------code provisions do not provide for what appears to be a -----%\npenalty calculation in relation to the amount of back wages awarded. As such, the amount of\nthe -----allocation to civil penalties that the taxpayer cannot substantiate could likely be\nconverted to wages, and thus subject to employment taxes. Additionally, while settlement\namounts properly allocated to interest cannot be converted to wages, we do not believe that the\ncurrent allocation of -----to interest is correct. As previously mentioned, the interest amount\nshould be a percentage of the total amount of unpaid wages that are being awarded. Any POSTF---------------- 6 portion of the -----amount that cannot be shown to be properly allocated to interest should also\nbe reallocated to wages, along with the correct portion of the amount allocated to civil penalties. In summary and based on the facts provided, we find that the IRS is not bound by the\nsettlement allocation payments made by -----------pursuant to the settlement agreements made\nwith managers of -------------------and -----------------. Additionally, the allocations that are properly\nshown to result from civil penalties under the ----------------------Code sections may not be\nreallocated to wages if determined to be liquidated damages, but the remaining amount of the ------allocation likely could be reallocated to wages, and thus subject to employment taxes. Please contact the undersigned at ---------------------if you have any further questions.
