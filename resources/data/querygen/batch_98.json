    "text": "If the document did not qualify\nas a valid return, the person could argue that section 6694 did not apply. In contrast, section 6701\nimposes liability on a person who aids or assist in, procures or advises with respect to the preparation of\nany return, affidavit, claim or other document. The language is broader and the Service would find it\neasier to impose liability under this section in the context of an invalid return. POSTN-119570-10/SCAF-106587-10 page 9 return penalty. However, if a person signs the business return and was not authorized\nto do so, or files it without a signature, then the Service may assert the frivolous return\npenalty against this person. Issue 1(g). Would the Service need to apply different rules when dealing with an\nS corporation as compared with a C corporation? If so, what would those rules\nor considerations be? Schedule C and Schedule S corporations file different income tax returns. The\nfirst results in liability at the corporate level and the second results in flow through with\nincome or loss reported at the shareholder level. The facts needed to determine\nwhether the entity filed the return or not, however, should not vary based on the\nclassification of the corporation. The facts needed to make the determination would\nremain essentially the same whether the Service was looking at a Form 1120, a Form\n1120-S, or a Form 941. Issue 2. Are all liabilities for withholding taxes assessed without the application\nof a statutory notice of deficiency procedure? For example, do the same\nprocedures apply to backup withholding and Federal income tax withheld at the\nsource? There are many different situations where taxes are withheld from payments. We assume from the context of your questions that you are asking about assessing\nwithholding taxes on a BMF return, that is, the Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY\nFederal Tax Return; Form 943, Employer's Annual Tax Return for Agricultural\nEmployees; Form 944, Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return; Form 945, Annual\nReturn of Withheld Federal Income Tax; and Form 1042, Annual Withholding Tax\nReturn for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons. If there are other withholding\nsituations you want us to address, please supplement you request for advice. 5 Taxes withheld from wages and other employment taxes generally are\nassessable without restrictions. See I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6203 and 6204(b). And penalties\nimposed for failure to withhold income tax from wages are assessable without the 90day letter. Enochs v. Green, 270 F.2d 558 (5th Cir. 1959); Lipsig v. United States, 187\nF. Supp. 826 (DCNY 1960). We note that taxpayers liable for trust fund taxes are given\n60 days notice before being assessed the 100% penalty imposed on responsible\npersons who fail to collect, account for, and pay over such taxes.

    "text": "In preparing the report, GAO obtained information from the BCBSA and a draft of the\nreport was furnished to the Association for comment. The BCBSA objected to the\nproposed legislation and contended that the plans' current exemption was warranted for\nseveral reasons. The first reason was \"The plans are nonprofit community service\norganizations that finance health care for individuals and small groups who could not\nobtain health insurance elsewhere.\" 1986 GAO Report, page 9.\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-514 (October 22, 1986), represents a\ncompromise between Congressional concerns that the tax-exempt status of BCBS\norganizations provided an unfair competitive advantage, and the relative disadvantages\ninherent in the operating structure of the BCBS system, where the BCBS license\nrequired that each member plan be organized on a non-profit basis and restricted the\noperations of each member plan to a specific territory. The 1986 Act added I.R.C. \u00a7 501(m), which effectively ended tax exempt\ntreatment for BCBS organizations by allowing tax exemption to an organization \"only if\nno substantial part of its activities consists of providing commercial-type insurance.\" At\nthe same time, the 1986 Act added section 833, which provides generally that BCBS\norganizations are taxable in the same manner as stock insurance companies. However, section 833 itself includes modifications of this treatment, while the Act\nincludes special transitional rules. Among the modifications from full taxation included in section 833 is the \"special\ndeduction\" allowed by section 833(a)(2) and defined in section 833(b)(1). As originally\nenacted, section 833(b)(1) provided as follows:\n(1) In general. -- Except as provided in paragraph (2), the deduction\ndetermined under this subsection for any taxable year is the excess (if\nany) of -(A) 25 percent of the sum of -(i) the claims incurred during the taxable year, and (ii) the expenses incurred during the taxable year in connection POSTU-144536-09 6\nwith the administration, adjustment, or settlement of claims,\nover (B)\n(2) the adjusted surplus as of the beginning of the taxable year. Limitation. -- The deduction determined under paragraph (1) for any\ntaxable year shall not exceed taxable income for such taxable year\n(determined without regard to such deduction). In 1997 section 833(b)(1)(A) was amended by adding to subparagraph (i) the phrase\n\"and liabilities incurred during the taxable year under cost-plus contracts\" and by adding\nto subparagraph (ii) the phrase \"or in connection with the administration of cost-plus\ncontracts.\" Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105-334, section 1604 (August 5,\n1997). These 1997 amendments are retroactive to the effective date of the original\n1986 legislation. The term \"adjusted surplus\" is defined in section 833(b)(3), along with related\ndefinitions of \"adjusted taxable income \" and \"adjusted net operating loss,\" and \"net\nexempt income.\" There is no statutory definition of the terms \"claims incurred\" or\n\"liabilities incurred during the taxable year under cost-plus contracts.\" On August 29, 1986, while the Act was still pending, the Joint Committee\nreleased a report \"Summary of Conference Agreement on H.R. 3838 (Tax Reform Act\nof 1986)\" which described the special deduction as follows:",

Example. Taxpayer J, a contractor,\nwas disabled as a direct result of participating in efforts to clean up the World\nTrade Center. J is eligible for compensation by the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund. J began receiving a disability pension at age 55 when J could\nno longer continue working because of\nJ\u2019s disability.

If J waits until\nage 62, normal retirement age under the\nplan, J would be entitled to a normal retirement benefit of $3,000 a month. The\npension plan provides that a participant\nwho retires early on account of disability\nis entitled to receive the participant's\nnormal retirement benefit, which in J's\ncase equals $3,000 per month.

Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, section 267(a)(3) requires a taxpayer to use\nthe cash method of accounting with respect to the deduction of amounts owed to a related foreign person. An amount that is owed to a related foreign person and that is otherwise deductible under Chapter 1 thus\nmay not be deducted by the taxpayer until such amount is paid to the related foreign person. . .\u201d\n(emphasis added.)

However, the plain language of the nondiscrimination clause,\nas highlighted above, specifically states that interest paid by an enterprise of one State\nto a resident of the other State shall be deductible under the same conditions as if they\nhad been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. The plain language of this\nprovision is clear that the interest must be actually paid to the foreign resident.

The U.S.- Country A Tax Treaty does not expressly define the term \u201cpaid.\u201d However, Article -----of the treaty provides that in the applying the treaty, any term used\nbut not defined in the treaty will have the meaning that it has under the law of the State\nwho is imposing the tax unless the context requires otherwise. Article -----further states\nthat if a term is defined under both the tax and non-tax laws of the State, the definition in\nthe tax law will take precedence over the definition in the non-tax law. Thus, we must\nlook to U.S. tax law first for the meaning of \u201cpaid\u201d in this context where the U.S. is\nimposing the tax at issue.",

From that result, subtract\nthe amount of the rollover. Enter the remaining amount on line 5b. If the remaining amount is zero and you have no\nother distribution to report on line 5b,\nenter -0- on line 5b. Also enter \"Rollover\" next to line 5b.

Lump-Sum Distributions If you received a lump-sum distribution\nfrom a profit-sharing or retirement plan,\nyour Form 1099-R should have the \"Total distribution\" box in box 2b checked.

You or whoever enrolled\nyou should have received Form 1095-A\nfrom the Marketplace with information\nabout who was covered and any advance\npayments of the premium tax credit. Innocent Spouse Relief\nGenerally, both you and your spouse are\neach responsible for paying the full\namount of tax, interest, and penalties on\nyour joint return. However, you may\nqualify for relief from liability for tax on\na joint return if (a) there is an understatement of tax because your spouse\nomitted income or claimed false deductions or credits; (b) you are divorced,\nseparated, or no longer living with your\nspouse; or (c) given all the facts and circumstances, it wouldn't be fair to hold\nyou liable for the tax. You may also\nqualify for relief if you were a married\nresident of a community property state\nbut didn't file a joint return and are now\nliable for an unpaid or understated tax. File Form 8857 to request relief. In\nsome cases, Form 8857 may need to be\nfiled within 2 years of the date on which\nthe IRS first attempted to collect the tax\nfrom you. Don\u2019t file Form 8857 with\nyour Form 1040 or 1040-SR. For more\ninformation, see Pub. 971 and Form\n8857, or you can call the Innocent\nSpouse office toll free at 855-851-2009.

Phishing\nis the creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business emails and websites.
