(a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of\nthis section, a practitioner shall not represent a\nclient before the Internal Revenue Service if the\nrepresentation involves a conflict of interest. A\nconflict of interest exists if \u2014\n(1) The representation of one client will be\ndirectly adverse to another client; or\n(2)There is a significant risk that the representation\nof one or more clients will be materially limited by\nthe practitioner\u2019s responsibilities to another client,\na former client or a third person, or by a personal\ninterest of the practitioner. (b) Notwithstanding the existence of a conflict\nof interest under paragraph (a) of this section, the\npractitioner may represent a client if \u2014\n(1) The practitioner reasonably believes that the\npractitioner will be able to provide competent and\ndiligent representation to each affected client;\n(2) The representation is not prohibited by law;\nand\n(3) Each affected client waives the conflict of (a) In general, a practitioner must, at the request of\na client, promptly return any and all records of the\nclient that are necessary for the client to comply with\nhis or her Federal tax obligations. The practitioner\nmay retain copies of the records returned to a client. The existence of a dispute over fees generally does\nnot relieve the practitioner of his or her responsibility\nunder this section. Nevertheless, if applicable state law\nallows or permits the retention of a client\u2019s records by\na practitioner in the case of a dispute over fees for\nservices rendered, the practitioner need only return\nthose records that must be attached to the taxpayer\u2019s\nreturn. The practitioner, however, must provide the\nclient with reasonable access to review and copy\nany additional records of the client retained by the\npractitioner under state law that are necessary for the\nclient to comply with his or her Federal tax obligations.

    "text": "Whipple v. CC:LM:RFPH:CHI:2:M:POSTF-130690-11 Page 6 Commissioner, 373 U.S. 193, 202 (1963). I.R.C. \u00a7 262(a) states that \u201cexcept as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, no\ndeduction shall be allowed for personal, living, or family expenses.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 170(a) allows as a deduction \u201cany charitable contribution . . . payment of which\nis made within the taxable year.\u201d Under \u00a7 170(b)(2), in the case of a taxpayer-corporation,\nthe deduction \u201cshall not exceed 10 percent of the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income.\u201d Under \u00a7\n170(c), in order to be deductible, the contribution must be made to certain units of\ngovernment, or to organizations organized and operated exclusively for religious,\ncharitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or to foster national or international\namateur sports competition, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, provided\nthe organization is not disqualified under \u00a7 501(c)(3). Analysis In our opinion, the expenditures at issue are not deductible by the taxpayer as they are\nnot ordinary and necessary expenses of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. In order for an\nexpenditure to be deductible as advertising, the taxpayer has the burden of proving a\nproximate relationship between the expenditure and the corporation\u2019s business, that the\nactivity \u201cwas reasonably calculated to call public attention to its business in some manner\nthat might reasonably be expected to produce some patronage benefit,\u201d and that the\nexpenditure was reasonable in amount compared to the reasonably expected benefits. W.D. Gale v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1960-191. For example, in W.D. Gale v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1960-191, the principal\nshareholder of an electrical contracting business was prominent in motor boat racing. The\nexpenses of that activity were held not deductible by the corporation as the corporation was\nrarely mentioned in connection with the activity and, therefore, the business \u201creceived no\nsubstantial publicity\u201d from the racing program. Similarly, in Sieber v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1979-15, the taxpayer claimed that his\npolo-playing activities were expenditures for the advertising and promotion of his building\nconstruction business. The court stated that\nPetitioner has the burden of proof that his costs of playing polo were\nordinary and necessary expenses of that business under section 162. To\ncarry his burden, it is incumbent upon petitioner to show affirmatively that\nthe expenditures were undertaken primarily for a business, not a social or\npersonal, purpose and that there was a proximate, rather than merely a\nremote or incidental, relationship between the expenditures and petitioner's\nbusiness -- essentially a question of fact. His burden is not made easier by\nthe fact that the expenses involved are of a character which are normally CC:LM:RFPH:CHI:2:M:POSTF-130690-11 Page 7 personal and, therefore, may fall within the ambit of section 262,\nwhich takes precedence over section 162. We conclude that petitioner has\nnot carried his burden of proof. The weight of the evidence strongly\nsuggests that petitioner played polo primarily because it gave him personal\nsatisfaction and helped him maintain a close relationship with his family. [citations omitted.] As the court stated in Mathes v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1990-483,\nSection 162(a) is not a carte blanche grant by the Government for the right\nto deduct all expenses which arguably are somewhat related to an incomeproducing activity, no matter how unreasonable in amount.",

How Long Should\nRecords Be Kept? Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items\nappearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and\n1099) until the statute of limitations runs\nout for that return. Usually, this is 3\nyears from the date the return was due or\nfiled or 2 years from the date the tax was\npaid, whichever is later. You should\nkeep some records longer. For example,\nkeep property records (including those\non your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or\nreplacement property. For more details,\nsee chapter 1 of Pub. 17. Amended Return\nFile Form 1040-X to change a return\nyou already filed. Generally, Form\n1040-X must be filed within 3 years af- ter the date the original return was filed\nor within 2 years after the date the tax\nwas paid, whichever is later. But you\nmay have more time to file Form\n1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically\nor mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details. Use the Where's My Amended Return\napplication on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return. It can take\nup to 3 weeks from the date you mailed\nit to show up in our system. Need a Copy of Your\nTax Return Information? Tax return transcripts are free and are\ngenerally used to validate income and\ntax filing status for mortgage applications, student and small business loan\napplications, and during tax return preparation. To get a free transcript:\n\u2022 Visit IRS.gov/Transcript,\n\u2022 Use Form 4506-T or 4506T-EZ, or\n\u2022 Call us at 800-908-9946. If you need a copy of your actual tax\nreturn, use Form 4506. There is a fee for\neach return requested. See Form 4506\nfor the current fee. If your main home,\nprincipal place of business, or tax records are located in a federally declared\ndisaster area, this fee will be waived. Death of a Taxpayer If a taxpayer died before filing a return\nfor 2022, the taxpayer's spouse or personal representative may have to file and\nsign a return for that taxpayer. A personal representative can be an executor, administrator, or anyone who is in charge\nof the deceased taxpayer's property. If\nthe deceased taxpayer didn't have to file\na return but had tax withheld, a return\nmust be filed to get a refund. The person\nwho files the return must enter \u201cDeceased,\u201d the deceased taxpayer's name,\nand the date of death across the top of\nthe return. If this information isn't provided, it may delay the processing of the\nreturn. If your spouse died in 2022 and you\ndidn't remarry in 2022, or if your spouse\ndied in 2023 before filing a return for\n2022, you can file a joint return. A joint\nreturn should show your spouse's 2022\nincome before death and your income for all of 2022. Enter \u201cFiling as surviving spouse\u201d in the area where you sign\nthe return.",
