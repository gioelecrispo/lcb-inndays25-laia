The termination of the \u201csafe harbor\u201d occurs, as applicable, because the\nHatch-Waxman Act makes filing of an ANDA prior to the expiration of the patents\ncovering the approved NDA an act of infringement (35 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 271(e)(2)(2010)), which has limited remedies (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(4)).57 As explained\nin Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U.S. 661 (1990), after quoting from 35 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 271(e)(2) and (e)(4):58\n55 Roche Prods., Inc. v. Bolar Pharm. Co., 733 F.2d 858 (Fed.Cir.1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 856\n(1984). 56 See Proveris Scientific Corp. v. Innovasystems, Inc, 536 F. 3d 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2008)(exemption from\ninfringement does not apply if the invention is not subject to FDA approval). 57 In exceptional cases, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(4) attorney fees can be awarded to the NDA\nholder if it prevails in an infringement actions against the sponsor of an ANDA. Yamanouchi\nPharmaceutical Co., Ltd. v. Danbury Pharmacal, Inc., 231 F.3d 1339, 1345-47 (Fed. Cir. 2000). 58 The Court in Eli Lilly quoted 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) and (e)(4), 496 U.S. at 675, as follows: \u201c \u2018(2) It shall\nbe an act of infringement to submit an application under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act or described in section 505(b)(2) of such Act for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of\nwhich is claimed in a patent, if the purpose of such submission is to obtain approval under such Act to\nengage in the commercial manufacture, use, or sale of a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is\nclaimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent. * * *\n**** POSTU-139175-10 54 The function of the paragraphs in question is to define a new (and\nsomewhat artificial) act of infringement for a very limited and\ntechnical purpose . . . .\n496 U.S. at 676 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court went on to explain, with respect to the Hatch-Waxman Act regime\nof exempting the use of patented inventions to develop generic drugs from infringement\nsuits then creating an artificial act of infringement, as follows: This scheme will not work, of course, if the holder of the patent\npertaining to the pioneer drug is disabled from establishing in court\nthat there has been an act of infringement. And that was precisely\nthe disability that the new [35 U.S.C.] \u00a7 271(e)(1) imposed with\nregard to use of his patented invention only for the purpose of\nobtaining premarketing approval. Thus, an act of infringement had\nto be created for these ANDA[s] . . . . That is what is achieved by\n\u00a7 271(e)(2)-the creation of a highly artificial act of infringement that\nconsists of submitting an ANDA . . . Not only is the defined act of\ninfringement artificial, so are the specified consequences, as set\nforth in subsection (e)(4). Monetary damages are permitted only if\nthere has been \u201ccommercial manufacture, use, or sale.\u201d 35 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 271(e)(4)(C).",

The broadcast stations will receive replacement equipment which will enable\nthem to continue operations without interruption and with \"comparable functionality\" on\nthe remaining licensed bandwidth. Pursuant to the FCC Order, the Transition\nAdministrator must provide the broadcasters with \"comparable facilities.\" Comparable\nfacilities are those that will provide the same level of service as the incumbent\u2019s existing\nfacilities, with transition to the new facilities as transparent as possible to the public end\nusers of the broadcast services. The FCC requires that the Transition Administrator\nprovide all equipment and related costs, or reimburse broadcasters for relocation costs\nincurred, including those for replacement equipment, integration, testing, and training\ncosts to ensure that the replacement equipment provides comparable functionality to\nthe broadcast stations. Accordingly, the provision of \"comparable facilities\" includes not\nonly the replacement equipment itself, but also the related installation and other capital\ncosts that the FCC has ordered the Transition Administrator to pay. It is not necessary to acquire property which duplicates exactly that which was\nconverted. Maloof, at 269. Thus, the fact that the new equipment may be more\nvaluable, or may employ more efficient circuitry than the converted equipment (in that it\nuses digital rather than analog circuitry) does not matter for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7\n1033(a)(1). Rather, what matters is that the replacement equipment received by\nTaxpayer is similar or related in service or use to that rendered worthless by the FCC\naction. In addition, the broadcast stations, as owner-users of the converted equipment,\nwill continue to be owner-users of the replacement equipment. Therefore, the\nreplacement equipment is similar or related in service or use to the converted\nequipment. 4 Rev. Rul. 64-237 delineates between the functional use of property held by the taxpayer as an owneruser and property held for investment but not used directly by the taxpayer (i.e., property owned by a\ntaxpayer but leased to another party). For property to qualify as replacement property for I.R.C. \u00a7 1033\npurposes, the physical characteristics of, and the taxpayer's relationship to, the replacement property\nmust be similar to the physical characteristics of, and the taxpayer's relationship to, the converted\nproperty. If a taxpayer is an owner/user of the converted property (as opposed to an owner/lessor), the\nrequired relationship of the taxpayer to the replacement property is to continue as an owner/user of the\nreplacement property. CC:LM:CTM:LA:2:POSTF-108806-08 page 8 CONCLUSION The FCC has implemented a spectrum reallocation plan to improve the\ncommunications capabilities of the nation's public safety first responders. Under this\nplan, incumbent BAS broadcasters must relocate to different and narrower frequency\nassignments. Such relocation necessitates, and the FCC Order requires, the broadcast\nstations to cease using certain of its existing equipment, the use of which would\notherwise cause interference with the new users of the reallocated and relicensed\nspectrum. Pursuant to the FCC Order, the broadcast stations will be provided with\n\"comparable facilities,\" that is, replacement equipment and related installation and other\ncapital costs that will allow the broadcast stations to continue operations on the new and\nnarrower spectrum licensed to them.",

Requirements for an\nElectronic Return To file your return electronically, you\nmust sign the return electronically using\na personal identification number (PIN)\nand provide the information described\nbelow. If you are filing online using\nsoftware, you must use a Self-Select\nPIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a\nSelf-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN. For 2022, if we issued you an identity\nprotection personal identification number (IP PIN) (as described in more detail\nbelow), all six digits of your IP PIN\nmust appear in the IP PIN spaces provi- ded next to the space for your occupation for your electronic signature to be\ncomplete. Failure to include an issued IP\nPIN on the electronic return will result\nin an invalid signature and a rejected return. If you are filing a joint return and\nboth taxpayers were issued an IP PIN,\nenter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN\nmethod allows you to create your own\nPIN. If you are married filing jointly,\nyou and your spouse will each need to\ncreate a PIN and enter these PINs as\nyour electronic signatures. A PIN is any combination of five digits you choose except five zeros. If you\nuse a PIN, there is nothing to sign and\nnothing to mail\u2014not even your Forms\nW-2. Your electronic return is considered a\nvalidly signed return only when it includes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your adjusted gross income (AGI) from your\noriginally filed 2021 federal income tax\nreturn, if applicable. If you're filing\njointly, your electronic return must also\ninclude your spouse's PIN, last name,\ndate of birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and\nAGI, if applicable, in order to be considered validly signed. Don\u2019t use your AGI\nfrom an amended return (Form 1040-X)\nor a math error correction made by the\nIRS. AGI is the amount shown on your\n2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. If\nyou don\u2019t have your 2021 income tax return, call the IRS at 800-908-9946 to get\na free transcript of your return or visit\nIRS.gov/Transcript. (If you filed electronically last year, you, and your\nspouse if filing jointly, may use your\nprior year PIN to verify your identity instead of your prior year AGI. The prior\nyear PIN is the five-digit PIN you used\nto electronically sign your 2021 return.) You can't use the Self-Select\nPIN method if you are a\nCAUTION first-time filer under age 16 at\nthe end of 2022. ! Practitioner PIN. The Practitioner PIN\nmethod allows you to authorize your tax\npractitioner to enter or generate your\nPIN. Your electronic return is considered a validly signed return only when it\nincludes your PIN, last name, date of\nbirth, and IP PIN, if applicable. If you're -61- filing jointly, your electronic return must\nalso include your spouse's PIN, last\nname, date of birth, and IP PIN, if applicable in order to be considered validly\nsigned.

    "text": "During this period, Taxpayer was considered\nto have productive capacity for alcohol not in excess of 60 million gallons per year. 1 Note that proposed regulations cannot be cited as precedent. We are restating it here to respond to the\nTaxpayer\u2019s argument described below that incorporates the proposed regulation. POSTU-121455-09 6 During the period that LLC was classified as a partnership commencing Date 3,\nTaxpayer and LLC would be treated as one person for purposes of the 60 million gallon\nproductive capacity limitation under the aggregation rule in \u00a7 40(g)(2) if they were\nconsidered to be under \u201ccommon control\u201d, and they would be considered under\ncommon control if Taxpayer was the owner of more than 50 percent of the profit interest\nor capital interest of LLC, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 1.52-1(b), (c)(1), and (c)(2)(iii). LLC was\nunder the \u201ccommon control\u201d of Taxpayer within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 40(g)(2) and 52(b)\nduring the period Date 3 through Date 7 because during such period Taxpayer owned\nmore than 50% of the LLC profit interest and more than 50% of the LLC capital. Therefore, Taxpayer and LLC were treated as one person during such period under the\naggregation rule in \u00a7 40(g)(2) for purposes of applying the 60 million gallon per year\nproductive capacity limitation. Under the aggregation rule, Taxpayer and LLC had combined productive capacity of I\ngallons from Date 3 until completion of the Ethanol Facility expansion in Date 6, and\ncombined productive capacity of J gallons from Date 6 through Date 7. As Taxpayer\nwas considered to have productive capacity in excess of 60 million gallons at some time\nduring its taxable year ending Date 9, Taxpayer was not an eligible small ethanol\nproducer at any time during such taxable year. Therefore, Taxpayer did not qualify for\nthe small ethanol producer credit for the ethanol production during the period Date 1\nthrough Date 2. RESPONSE TO TAXPAYER\u2019S POSITION\nTaxpayer\u2019s position is that Taxpayer qualified as an eligible small ethanol producer\nduring the period Date 1 through Date 2, because during such period it was the deemed\nowner of the Ethanol Facility and its productive capacity did not exceed 60 million\ngallons. Taxpayer\u2019s primary argument is that during the period commencing Date 3, the\nproductive capacities of Taxpayer and LLC should not be combined under the\naggregation rule in \u00a7 40(g)(2) for purposes of the productive capacity limitation. Taxpayer\u2019s alternate argument is that, if it is necessary to consider LLC\u2019s productive\ncapacity, Taxpayer qualified as an eligible small ethanol producer by applying the\nproductive capacity limitation at the level of Taxpayer\u2019s patrons under the pass-through\nentity rule in \u00a7 40(g)(3). Taxpayer\u2019s primary argument is that the productive capacities of Taxpayer and LLC\nshould not be combined under the aggregation rule in \u00a7 40(g)(2) for purposes of\napplying the productive capacity limitation. Taxpayer concedes that LLC did not qualify\nas an eligible small ethanol producer during the period Date 3 through Date 7 and that\nTaxpayer and LLC were under common control within the meaning of \u00a7 40(g)(2) during\nthe period Date 3 through Date 7.",

    "text": "It usually takes\nabout 2 weeks to get an SSN once the\nSSA has all the evidence and information it needs. Check that both the name and SSN\non your Forms 1040 or 1040-SR, W-2,\nand 1099 agree with your social security\ncard. If they don\u2019t, certain deductions\nand credits on Form 1040 or 1040-SR\nmay be reduced or disallowed and you\nmay not receive credit for your social\nsecurity earnings. If your Form W-2\nshows an incorrect SSN or name, notify\nyour employer or the form-issuing agent\nas soon as possible to make sure your\nearnings are credited to your social security record. If the name or SSN on\nyour social security card is incorrect,\ncall the SSA. Once you are issued an SSN, use it to\nfile your tax return. Use your SSN to file -14- your tax return even if your SSN does\nnot authorize employment or if you have\nbeen issued an SSN that authorizes employment and you lose your employment authorization. An ITIN will not be\nissued to you once you have been issued\nan SSN. If you received your SSN after\npreviously using an ITIN, stop using\nyour ITIN. Use your SSN instead. IRS Individual Taxpayer\nIdentification Numbers\n(ITINs) for Aliens If you are a nonresident or resident alien\nand you don\u2019t have and aren\u2019t eligible to\nget an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN. If you already have an ITIN, enter it\nwherever your SSN is requested on your\ntax return. Some ITINs must be renewed. If you\nhaven't used your ITIN on a federal tax\nreturn at least once for tax years 2019,\n2020, or 2021, it expired at the end of\n2022 and must be renewed if you need\nto file a federal tax return in 2023. You\ndon't need to renew your ITIN if you\ndon't need to file a federal tax return. You can find more information at\nIRS. gov/ITIN. ITINs assigned before 2013\nTIP have expired and must be renewed if you need to file a tax\nreturn in 2023. If you previously submitted a renewal application and it was approved, you do not need to renew again\nunless you haven't used your ITIN on a\nfederal tax return at least once for tax\nyears 2019, 2020, or 2021. An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't\nentitle you to social security benefits or\nchange your employment or immigration status under U.S. law. For more information on ITINs, including application, expiration, and renewal, see Form W-7 and its instructions. If you receive an SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS\noffice or write a letter to the IRS explaining that you now have an SSN and\nwant all your tax records combined under your SSN. Details about what to include with the letter and where to mail it\nare at IRS. gov/ITIN. Nonresident Alien Spouse If your spouse is a nonresident alien,\nyour spouse must have either an SSN or\nan ITIN if:\n\u2022 You file a joint return, or\n\u2022 Your spouse is filing a separate return.
