Section 833(b)? CONCLUSION The \u201cHost\u201d transactions are not properly included in the calculation of Taxpayer\u2019s special deduction under\nI.R.C. \u00a7 833(B) because the payment of the \u201cHost\u201d transactions does not reflect claims, liabilities, or\nexpenses incurred by Taxpayer in the administration of cost-plus contracts. Taxpayer\u2019s obligation to\nparticipate in the Inter-Plan Programs, including the Home/Host Program, is pursuant to a licensing\nagreement with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The \u201cHost\u201d transactions are not paid by\nTaxpayer as a result of a benefit policy or cost-plus contract with a member, an employer group or a\nnational account. Further, Taxpayer\u2019s contractual reimbursement arrangements with its network of\nproviders are not cost-based contracts, but are service contracts. None of these arrangements constitute\nobligations imposed upon Taxpayer under a cost-plus contract.

The Association controls the Blue Cross\nand Blue Shield names and symbols. POSTF-111423-12 3 Historically, BCBS plans were organized independently in each state (or portion of a state) with each\nseparate BCBS plan negotiating fee arrangements with the health care providers in its own territory. A\nLicensee was restricted to its own Service Area (i.e., territory), and was granted exclusive use of the\nBCBS names and symbols in that Service Area. Since each Plan is limited to its Service Area, it was\nimportant for the Association to develop a mechanism whereby Members covered by one Plan could\nhave claims paid if said Member required medical care outside of his or her Plan's Service Area. Additionally, employers with a headquarters in one Plan's service territory could have employees in\nmultiple BCBS territories outside of the HQ Plan's service area (National Account entities). Accordingly,\nthe Association put in place a collection of policies, provisions, processing standards, delivery platforms,\nmanuals, and requirements, to resolve claims incurred by Members outside of their Plan's Service Area. These mechanisms are referred to as \"National Programs\", which programs \"provide portability of\nmembership between Blues plans and ease claim processing for customers that receive benefits outside\nof its service area.\" General Accounting Office, Blue Cross and Blue Shield: Experiences of Weak Plans\nUnderscore the Role of Effective State Oversight, GAO/HEHS-94-71 (April 1994), p. 29.

(emphasis\nadded) Accordingly, in order to facilitate coverage for policyholders that required medical care outside of the\nService Area of the BCBS plan that issued the policy, the Association administers a clearinghouse\noperation for the processing and payment of said claims. This clearinghouse operation is one of several\nInter-Plan Programs (\"IPP\") administered by the Association, with each IPP consisting of established\npolicies, processing standards, and procedures. Additionally, to administer the programs, the Association\nmaintains the contract with a Central Financing Agency (\"CFA\") that performs the clearinghouse\nfunctions. The calculation issue under \u00a7 833(b) stems from the Inter-Plan Programs that allows BCBS\nmember/subscribers to receive insurance coverage while outside of the Service Area of the BCBS plan\nthat issued the insurance policy to the member/subscriber.

      "content": "The Inter-Plan Claims processing under the BlueCard and National Account Programs follow the same\nbasic steps (discussed in detail below). The Home Licensee, also referred to as the \"Control\" Licensee in the Association's materials, is defined\nas the \"Licensee in whose Service Area a National Account is headquartered, and/or any Licensee whose\nMember receives services from an Inter-Plan Programs eligible provider in another Licensee's Service\nArea.\" (IPPP, Definitions, p. 3). The BCBS Plan that operates in the territory in which another Plan's Member received medical care is the\n\"Host\" or \"Par\" Licensee, with the Host/Par Licensee delivering \"the benefit of its arrangements with its\nlocal and Remote Providers eligible for Inter-Plan Programs, on behalf of Control/Home Licensee\nMembers who incur claims within its Service Area.\" (IPPP, Definitions, p. 6). Using the processing and communication network sponsored by the Association under the Home/Host\nProgram, the Control/Home Licensee: (i) handles claims processing and reimbursement to the Par/Host\nLicensees; (ii) makes eligibility and benefit determinations; and (iii) gains access to health care providers\nparticipating in the Par/Host Licensee's network. (IPPP, 1.01, Policy Statement). The issue raised in this case is as follows:\nWhich BCBS Plan may include in its special deduction calculation under \u00a7 833(b) the\namounts paid to satisfy Provider Claims for services provided to a Member outside of the\nService Area of the BCBS Plan that issued the policy to the Member? In other words,\nshould the Home/Control Licensee, or the Host/Par Licensee, include that expense in the\n\u00a7 833(b) calculation? It is the Government\u2019s position that only the Home/Control Licensee properly includes the expense in the\nspecial deduction calculation under \u00a7 833(b). Since Taxpayer has included both its Home expenses and Host expenses to arrive at its claimed special\ndeductions under \u00a7 833(a), Taxpayer\u2019s position is that both the Home/Control Licensee and the Host/Par\nLicensee may include these expenses in their respective special deduction calculations under \u00a7 833(b). This issue is referred to herein as the \u201cHome/Host\u201d issue. To fully understand this \"Home/Host\" issue, a\nrather extensive review of the policies, procedures and contracts involved in administering the Inter-Plan\nPrograms is provided below. Mechanics of Claim Processing Between Home and Host Plans\nGenerally, if a BCBS organization is acting as a \"Host\" Plan, it collects the initial claims data and forwards\nit to the Home Plan for a determination as to whether the claim is covered under the policy issued by the\nHome Plan. The Host Plan does not make any determination regarding the scope of coverage or the\nMember\u2019s eligibility for coverage. The Home Plan evaluates the data submitted by the Host Plan,\ndetermines whether and how much of the claim is allowable, and advises the Host Plan of its\ndetermination. The Host Plan then makes payment to the service provider and submits a claim to the\nHome Plan for reimbursement. The \"Host\" claims included in Taxpayer's special deduction computations POSTF-111423-12 5 at issue herein are for those claims Taxpayer paid, after the Home Plan approved making the payment,\nand for which Taxpayer received reimbursement from the Home Plan. The interplay between the Home Plan and Host Plan is probably best understood by reviewing the claim\nprocessing steps.",

Both of these\nschematics are from The Inter-Plan Programs Manual. Blue Cross and Blue Shield License Agreements (BCBS License Agreements): The BCBS License\nAgreements grant to each Plan the right to use BLUE CROSS or BLUE SHIELD in its trade and/or\ncorporate name (the \"Licensed Name\"), and the right to use the Licensed Marks, in the sale, marketing\nand administration of health care plans and related services in the Service Area.

Out-of-Territory Services \u2013 Claim Processing: When a Member receives care outside of his Home\nPlan\u2019s Service Area, the provider files a claim with the local BCBS Plan. This local Plan, which is the\nHost Plan, validates the provider information and applies its pricing (if a network provider) using a set of\nstandard pricing methods and rules. The claim price is called the negotiated price for purposes of InterPlan Program claims, and the Host Plan can use actual, estimated or average pricing methods to\n4\ncommunicate its pricing to the Home Plan. The Host Licensee is required to transmit to the Home\n4 The characteristics of the types of Inter-Plan claim pricing are summarized as follows:\nActual \u2013 An actual price is a negotiated provider payment without any other increases or\ndecreases. Estimated \u2013 An estimated price is a negotiated provider payment reduced or increased by a\npercentage to take into account certain payments negotiated with the provider and other claimand non-claim-related transactions. Such transaction may include, but are not limited to, antifraud and abuse recoveries, provider refunds not applied on a claim-specific basis, retrospective\nsettlements, and performance-related bonuses or incentives. Average \u2013 An average price is a percentage of billed covered charges representing the aggregate\nnegotiated provider payments for all of a Par/Host Plan\u2019s healthcare providers or a similar\nclassification of its providers, and other claim- and non-claim-related transactions. Such\ntransactions may include the same ones as noted for an estimated price. Inter-Plan Programs Manual (IPP Manual), Ch. 23: Finance and Accounting, p. 5 (rev. 02/12).

The BlueCard\nProgram Manual, Ch. 3, The Policies and Provisions, \u00a7 3.72. The primary concern behind these\nprovisions is to make certain that the Host Licensee accurately passed onto the Home Licensee the\ndiscounts available under its provider contract or network. The objective of the estimated/average pricing\nis to equate to actual aggregate pricing over time, considering that individual claim pricing rates may be\nhigher or lower than the pricing rate used. Any changes to the components of the estimate/average\npricing rate format must be approved by Association IPP Finance staff before the change can be\nimplemented.

POSTF-111423-12 6 Licensee\u2019s pricing information related to discounts or differentials received from contracting providers, as\nwell as charges submitted by providers. IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 5.\nBecause Taxpayer has invested heavily, and well, in its claim processing function, it always uses actual\npricing to communicate its Host claims to the Home Plans. The Host Plan creates a Submission Format (SF) transaction (mapping/data entering claim submission\ninformation, pricing information, and pricing conditions) and transmits it to the Plan that maintains the\nmembership (the Home Plan). The SF is transmitted to the Home Plan based on the Member\u2019s account\nalpha-prefix. Each Licensee has a different alpha prefix, which prefix dictates how the claims are routed. Upon receipt of the SF, the Home Plan determines the Member\u2019s eligibility and coverage and adjudicates\n5\nthe claim (i.e., determines which of the provided services were eligible and covered). The Home Plan\nthen approves or denies the provider payment and sends an Explanation of Benefits to the Member. The\nHome Licensee calculates the liability for the claim using the ITS Uniform Pricing Facility, which combines\nthe Home Licensee adjudication results with pricing information submitted by the Host License, to\ndetermine Member liability and the approved provider payment amount (Home Licensee liability). Finally,\nthe Home Plan creates a Disposition Format (DF) transaction. The DF includes the claim adjudication\nresults, authorizes claim payment to the provider, calculates a standard administrative expense allowance\n6\n(AEA) , and calculates any network access fee (AF) payable to the Host Plan. The Host/Licensee may\ncharge an Access Fee for \"delivering the benefits of its provider contracts or networks to a Control/Home\nLicensee.\" (IPPP, Definitions, p. 1). Host Licensees that charge an Access Fee must \"certify that they\nhave enforceable agreements with their providers that hold the Control/Home Licensee Members\nharmless from balance billing and that the Par/Host Licensee will carry out such enforcement.\" IPPP, IP\n3.08, Policy Statement (05/12). Access Fees are usually computed as a percentage of the savings\n7\nbetween a provider\u2019s standard rate and Taxpayer\u2019s contracted rates. The Home Plan then sends the DF\nto the Host Plan.

The access fee is determined by multiplying the access fee percentage by the differential between the\nbilled charge (covered charge) on the claim and the sum of provider payments from all sources (Licensee\nand Member). IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 17. However, in no event may the Access Fee exceed $2,000\nper Claim, with the $2,000 cap applied to related submissions in the aggregate for interim bills and not to\neach individual submission.

On receipt of the DF from the Home Licensee, the Host Licensee\nestablishes (debits) an account receivable for the amount of the net liability; that is, the approved provider\npayment, the AEA and the access fee or access fee offset. The offsetting credits are to accounts payable\nfor the provider payable amount, administrative expense reimbursement, and other income for the access\nfee, in the corresponding amounts. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 6). Host Payment to Provider. Once the Host Licensee receives the DF, it pays the provider by processing\nthe claim through its local system. If the claim was priced using other than actual pricing (for example, if\nan average discount was used), the Host Licensee computes the true payment due to the provider.

(IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p.\n11)\nReconciliation Transactions. After paying the provider, the Host Licensee prepares a Reconciliation\nFormant (RF) to request reimbursement of the net liability (approved provider payment, AEA and access\nfee) from the Home Licensee and transmits it to the Central Finance Agency (discussed in detail below). Depending on the claims pricing method used, the actual provider payment and the approved provider\npayment included in the net liability may differ.

The CFA Agreement establishes\nthe contract with the banking institution that will transmit to, and receive payments from, Licensees that\nare participating in these Inter-Plan Programs. To perform the CFA functions, Bank has developed software to administer the program, and ownership of\nthe CFA software was granted to the Association under the CFA Agreement. Therefore, the CFA\nservices involve not only the banking services, but also the provision of a proprietary claims settlement\nsystem for use of the BCBSA Licensees to administer the Inter-Plan Programs. To perform the\nnecessary claims settlement, Bank processes payment requests, collects funds from the Plan that owes\nother Plans more than the amount of funds that are owed to it (either by ACH, Automated Clearing\nHouse, access to a designated account, or by requiring a wire transfer under certain circumstances), and\nforwards the funds to the Plans which are owed more from other Plans than it owes to other Plans (via\nACH deposit into Plans\u2019 designated account). The Payment Requests are electronic requests, and are the Reconciliation Formats (RF) described\nabove. Settlement of the net liabilities among the Licensees/Plans is performed daily. The CFA advises each\nLicensee at the close of each business day of its net settlement status with regard to credits, as a\nHost Licensee, and charges, as a Home Licensee (Daily Batch Settlement Summary Report BS36001). The report is used by a Host Licensee as the source for recording reimbursement of\nreceivables from a Home Licensee and by a Home Licensee as the source for recording payment\nto Licensees for Host Licensee claims. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 22)\nDaily net settlements are performed directly by the CFA via direct access to the participating Licensee\u2019s\ndesignated local financial institution. Each Licensee is required to designate an account at a banking\ninstitution of its choice that the CFA is authorized to access for daily withdrawals or deposits of net\nsettlement amounts. Licensees are required to ensure that the accounts are adequately funded to cover\non-demand withdrawals. In addition to the Licensee\u2019s requirement to ensure adequate funding, the CFA Agreement provides for\nthe maintenance of a Zero Balance Account (\u201cZBA\u201d) System whereby each Participant must maintain a\nZBA account at Bank, with the Association required to maintain a ZBA Master Account at Bank. In addition to the ZBA accounts, the CFA Agreement required maintenance of the General Program Fund\nCollateral Account (\u201cGeneral Program Fund\u201d) at Bank.",

The General Program Fund is to be used as\nworking capital to cover any shortfalls, with minimum balance of Amount 1required to be in the General\nProgram Fund at all times. Each Licensee is required to contribute to the General Program Fund, with\nthe amount to be contributed by each Licensee determined on a quarterly basis based upon the ratio of a\nLicensee\u2019s gross quarterly Home claims over the aggregate of all Licensee\u2019s gross quarterly Home\nclaims. While the General Program Fund is not intended to cover a possible failure and the resulting Host Claim\nliability (BC 3.1, Licensee Financial Obligations), the General Program Fund is to be immediately debited\nby the CFA if a Licensee in a net liability position does not have sufficient funds in its account, and fails to POSTF-111423-12 9 wire sufficient funds, to cover its net liability. The amount of the debit is treated as a loan to the Licensee,\nwith interest charged for the shortfall condition. The Association is required to remit amounts necessary\nto restore the minimum Amount 1 balance, regardless of any failure of a Licensee to make its required\ndeposit. (If a Licensee is removed from the CFA service, then the Association shall reallocate the\nGeneral Program Fund requirement among the remaining Plans within 10 days, with the remaining Plans\nrequired to submit the necessary funds to cover the shortfall).

During the years at issue, Taxpayer identified an Administrative Services Contract (ASC) that it\nadministers for Plan B. Plan B has several \u201cbig\u201d accounts for which the claims are processed by\nTaxpayer. Basically, this arrangement is a result of Taxpayer\u2019s ability to process claims much more\nefficiently than the Plan B is able to do so internally. However, even as to these accounts, the Member\nbenefits are determined under Member\u2019s contract under the Plan B.\nTaxpayer issues the healthcare cards to the Members, but the card looks as if it is issued by the Plan B\nand the Members are unaware of Taxpayer\u2019s involvement in the claim processing.

Taxpayer even acts as the Home Plan as to the Plan B, with the\nPlan B acting as the \u201cHost\u201d Plan for the accounts administered under this ASA arrangement. Accordingly,\nfor Plan B customers receiving services in Taxpayer\u2019s service area, Taxpayer pays the claims directly to\nthe provider. For customers receiving services outside Taxpayer\u2019s service area, the Host Plan pays the\nclaims directly to the provider and Taxpayer reimburses the Host Plan. Under this arrangement, even the\nPlan B is a \u201cHost\u201d Plan as to Taxpayer, for customers receiving services in Florida. After either the provider is claimed or the Host Plan is reimbursed (depending upon where the services\nwere received), Taxpayer is reimbursed by the account-holder. What is the Risk of Reimbursement Failure? Under the contracts that Taxpayer has with providers (both facilities and individuals), Taxpayer is legally\nobligated to make payment for services provided to not only Taxpayer customers, but to Members under\nother Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans. The provider agrees to look only to Taxpayer for payment (other than\ndeductibles and co-insurance), and to not pursue collection against either the Members or the other Blue\nCross Blue Shield Plan.

In response to IDR # ----, Taxpayer indicated that there are \u201crare\u201d occurrences when Taxpayer, as a Host\nPlan, pays a provider (pursuant to Taxpayer\u2019s contract with the provider) and does not receive\nreimbursement from the Home Plan. The two primary causes for reimbursement failure identified by\nTaxpayer are:\nThe Home Plan\u2019s customer has cancelled coverage and the claims adjustment process was not\ncompleted in time to meet the run-out period agreed to. The Home Plan disagrees with the claim and Taxpayer chooses not to pursue to avoid a conflict\nwith the Provider. As to the first cause, Home Plan cancellation, it was explained that the normal cut-off date for claims\nprocessing (which usually involves a two-year window) is greatly reduced and Taxpayer fails to process\nthe claims within that cut-off period. For example, if a customer files bankruptcy, there will be an\nacceleration of claims processing so the amount owed by the customer to the Home Plan can be\ndetermined with certainty, which in turn accelerates the requirement on the Host Plans to submit claims\nfor reimbursement timely. As to the second cause, if Taxpayer pays a provider and then the Home Plan disagrees with the claim,\nnormally Taxpayer\u2019s remedy would be to collect the amount from the provider. The provider contracts\nprovide for offset of charges so that, if Taxpayer owes additional amounts to the provider, the\nunreimbursed amount can be netted against the amount Taxpayer will pay to the provider for those\nproviders with whom Taxpayer has an ongoing relationship. The \u201cclaim adjustment\u201d would simply be\nprocessed through the normal channels used to pay and settle claims. Additionally, the provider\ncontracts provide for payment by the provider, within 30 days of notice of claim disallowance, if the\nprovider is not owed any monies by Taxpayer at the time. Taxpayer has not quantified, as either an absolute number or a relative number, the amount of Host\nclaims that were paid out but not reimbursed by the Home Plan, nor recovered from the provider. In other\nwords, how much Taxpayer may have been out-of-pocket in connection with provider claims paid on\nbehalf of Members under other Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans. However, when asked what was intended\nby the use of the term \u201crare\u201d when describing instances of non-reimbursement, Taxpayer explained that POSTF-111423-12 13 each and every case in which the Taxpayer is not made whole for Host claims that it paid, there was a\nmanual processing of the exception, with each and every exception having to be approved. If there was\nno reimbursement due to a Home Plan cancellation, the decision to abandon further efforts to collect from\nthe Home Plan is reviewed and has to be approved. If there is a decision to not pursue recoupment from\na provider, that decision to forego collection is reviewed and has to be approved. There are no \u201cde\nminimis\u201d dollar limits.",

Chief Counsel Field Attorney Advice (FAA), 2010 IRS NSAR 1502F, 2010 WL 1633317 (IRS NSAR)\n(February 4, 2010, released March 16, 2010) determined that only claims and liabilities processed by a\nBlue Cross Blue Shield organization as a \"Home Plan,\" and not those processed as a \"Host Plan,\" may\nbe considered claims incurred and liabilities incurred for purposes of calculating the special deduction\nunder \u00a7 833. The FAA concludes that: POSTF-111423-12 15 The special deduction applies only to claims and liabilities with respect to subscribers of\nthe plan claiming the deduction and does not include claims and liabilities with respect to\nsubscribers of other plans. In computing the special deduction described in section\n833(b), a \"Host\" plan may include only claims and liabilities of its own subscribers and not\nclaims and liabilities of subscribers of other BCBS plans for which it is reimbursed by the\n\"Home\" plans of those subscribers. The FAA covers this issue thoroughly and, rather than restating the analysis herein in full, a complete\ncopy is attached for your convenience.",

      "content": "The FAA covers this issue thoroughly and, rather than restating the analysis herein in full, a complete\ncopy is attached for your convenience. However, the primary points raised in the FAA to disallow\ninclusion of the Host claims in the computation of the special deduction, and equally applicable to\nTaxpayer's position herein, are as follows:\n1. The \"cost\" does not satisfy the minimal definitional requirement under \u00a7 833 because the \"cost\"\nis not that of the Host Licensee/Taxpayer. 2. Legislative history and statutory purpose of \u00a7 833 are inconsistent with multiple BCBS Plans\nincluding the same Provider claims in their special deduction computations, since \"surplus\" or\n\"reserves\" are only needed for one payment of a claim and are not needed for each transfer of\nfunds between BCBS plans during the claim administration process. 3. In this case, two taxpayers \u2013 the Home Plan and the Host Plan \u2013 are claiming a deduction based\nupon the same transaction: payment for services received by a subscriber under an insurance\npolicy written by the Home Plan. Two taxpayers may not claim a deduction based upon one\ntransaction, regardless of the interplay in the claim processing steps. 4. A fundamental principle of federal income taxation is that when a statute allows a deduction for\nan item that is \"paid or incurred,\" it is only allowable to the person incurring the liability that is\nbeing paid. Griffin v. Commissioner, 7 B.T.A. 1094 (1927) (petitioner denied deduction when paid\ninterest expense of a corporation); Colston v. Commissioner, 21 B.T.A. 396 (1930), aff'd sub\nnom. Colston v. Burnet, 59 F. 2d 867 (D.C. Cir. 1932), cert denied, 287 U.S. 640 (1932)\n(husband denied deduction for taxes and interest paid on property owned by wife). The Host\nplan never \"incurs\" a liability. It is merely complying with the claim processing procedures for\nInter-Plan Programs, as required by its License with the Association. 5. It is not necessary for purposes of this case to determine a precise definition of \"cost-plus\" within\nthe meaning of \u00a7 833(b), because under the Home/Host program, the Host can never satisfy the\nminimal definitional requirement of \"cost-plus\" because the \"cost\" is not a liability incurred by the\nHost. 6. The NAIC Annual Statement does not include any item comparable to the section 833(b) special\ndeduction. Accordingly, comparisons of the treatment of items on the Annual Statement and the\ntreatment of items for purposes of the special deduction are inconclusive at best. Furthermore,\nthe Taxpayer has not established that there is any consistent, recognized Annual Statement\ntreatment for the Home/Host arrangements. Taxpayer\u2019s assets are not a risk\nThe Home Plan adjudicates the claim. The Home Plan bears all insurance risk. Taxpayer (Host Plan) is\nreimbursed by the Home Plan for provider payments through the CFA within 3 to 5 days. Taxpayer\nallows Home Plans use of its network of providers for an Administrative Fee and an Access Fee.\nTaxpayer (Par/Host Plan) merely pays the claims (claims processing agent) and is reimbursed by the\nHome Plan for claim payments and administrative costs. Taxpayer\u2019s records show that Taxpayer does\nnot assume any risk of not being reimbursed for payments to providers. POSTF-111423-12 16",

POSTF-111423-12 16 While this reiteration is somewhat redundant of the Facts section, it is worth highlighting the procedures\nthat are followed in processing the Inter-Plan Programs because it so clearly shows that Taxpayer has no\ninsurance risk in connection with the Host expenditures. Further, based upon the Inter-Plan procedures,\nthe CFA Agreement, and Membership Standards, Taxpayer did not even have any credit risk in\nconnection with the Host expenditures. Inter-Plan Programs Manual provides the following:\n1. All Claims processed using the Central Financial Agency for financial settlement must be for benefits\npayable under a contract to which a Licensee is a party and under which the Brands are used\npursuant to a License granted to such Licensee. (IPP Manual, \u00a7 3.01, Licensee Financial\nObligations, p. 71). 2. As part of the CFA process, net settlement and fund movement activities will be performed. To\nensure adequate and timely funding of applicable Inter-Plan Program payments, each Licensee will\nbe required to participate as detailed below. (IPP Manual, \u00a7 3.01, Licensee Financial Obligations, p.\n71). 3. Licensees will settle via Automated Clearing House (ACH) transactions in which debits are executed\nthrough the Federal Reserve System and funds are withdrawn from a Licensee\u2019s designated account,\nexcept when the Association determines a Licensee must settle debits using federal funds wire\ntransfers because it is not able to guarantee payment of BlueCard and/or other Inter-Plan Program\nClaims. ACH credit transactions will be used for funds deposits for Licensees. (IPP Manual, \u00a7 3.01,\nLicensee Financial Obligations, p. 71). 4. A fund, to be known as General Program Fund, to cover ITS transmitted financial transactions settled\nthrough the CFA will be established and a balance will be maintained to be used as working capital to\ncover CFA settlement funding shortfalls for any Licensee. (IPP Manual, \u00a7 3.01, General Program\nFund, p. 71). 5. No Licensee will have a property or other right to money in this general fund beyond the amount the\nLicensee itself has contributed, less amounts owed to other Licensees pursuant to the net settlement\nprocess. (IPP Manual, General Program Fund, \u00a7 3.01, p. 71). 6. The monies in the General Program Fund belong to the Licensees. Each Licensee/CFA participant\u2019s\nindividual portion is based on the ratio of the participant\u2019s gross quarterly Control/Home debit activity\namount for a quarter compared to the aggregate of all Participants\u2019\u2019 gross quarterly Control/Home\ndebit activity amount for such quarter. (IPP Manual, \u00a7 3.01, General Program Fund, p. 71). 7. All Licensees will be required to maintain funds on deposit in the General Program Fund equal to the\nproportionate share of an amount negotiated between the Association and the CFA that the\nLicensee\u2019s Control/Home dollar volume bears to the aggregate of all Licensees\u2019 Control/Home dollar\nvolumes for the previous quarter. (IPP Manual, \u00a7 3.01, General Program Fund, p. 72). 8. In the event of: (a) a return of an automated clearinghouse debit transaction or (b) if a Licensee fails\nto wire sufficient funds to cover its daily settlement position, the General Program Fund account will\nbe immediately debited to fund the shortfall amount.",

The Licensee must replenish\nthe General Program Fund using a federal fund wire transfer on the day so notified. If the General\nProgram Fund is not replenished by the Licensee, the Association will fund such shortfall. (IPP\nManual, \u00a7 3.01, General Program Fund, p. 72). POSTF-111423-12 17 9. The Central Financial Agency (CFA) is responsible for calculating and effecting daily net settlements\namong Licensees and communicating relevant information to Licensees and the Association in\naccordance with terms of the Agreement with the Association. (IPP Manual, \u00a7 3.02, CFA, p. 73). After paying the provider, the Host Licensee prepares a Reconciliation Formant (RF) to request\nreimbursement of the net liability (approved provider payment, AEA and access fee) from the Home\nLicensee through the CFA. Payment must be approved or denied by the Home Licensee within three\nbusiness days unless the Home Licensee is granted an extension by the Association. (IPP Manual, Ch.\n23, p. 12). 1. It usually takes a Host Licensee three to six days from the time it receives an approved DF record\nto issue an RF record to the CFA for reimbursement to actually getting paid by the Home\nLicensee. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 19). 2. The CFA is responsible for calculating and effecting daily net settlements among Licensees and\ncommunicating relevant information to Licenses and the Association in accordance with the terms\nof the contract with the Association. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 22). 3. The Host Licensee transmits the RFs to the CFA, where they are sorted and routed to the\nappropriate Home Licensees for approval/denial of payment. Payment must be approved or\ndenied by the Home Licensee within three business days. The Home Licensee has the option of\neither transmitting approval/denial to the CFA for Host Licensee reimbursement or transmitting\nonly denials and allowing approval to be assumed. In the latter case and in the absence of\ndenials, the CFA\u2019s three day clock will trigger automatic reimbursement for approved amounts\ndue. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, pp. 18 and 22). 4. If a net amount is due to a Licensee, the CFA transmits the amount to a Licensee-designated\nbank account via ACH (Automate Clearing House) transactions executed through the Federal\nReserve System. If a net amount is due from a Licensee, the debit transaction is made via either\nthe ACH or a federal funds wire transfer. The mode of settlement depends on the financial status\nof Licensee with the Association. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 22). 5. Licensees must contribute to a General Program Fund Collateral Account, which is used as a\ngeneral fund to cover CFA settlement shortfalls for any Licensee. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 22).",

Licensees must contribute to a General Program Fund Collateral Account, which is used as a\ngeneral fund to cover CFA settlement shortfalls for any Licensee. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 22). 6. The CFA will send a daily report to each Licensee that will have activity in its CFA bank account\non the following day. This Daily Batch Settlement Summary Report lists the amount to be\ntransferred to or from the Licensee\u2019s local bank account via either the automated clearing house\nprocess or wire transfer. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 22). 7. Under the BlueCard Program, all Licensees are required to maintain a local bank account that the\nCFA is authorized to access for daily withdrawals or deposits of net settlement amounts for\nqualifying claims and other Inter-Plan reimbursements. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 24). 8. Each month the Association issues a statement for all Inter-Plan Programs including the\nBlueCard Program and other ITS delivery models, to each Licensee. (IPP Manual, Ch. 23, p. 24). CONCLUSION It is determined that the Host deductions are not claims, liabilities, or expenses incurred by Taxpayer\nin the administration of cost-plus contracts pursuant to \u00a7 833(b). This determination is based upon an\nexamination and analysis of records (License Agreement, Membership Standards, Inter-Plan Programs POSTF-111423-12 18 Manuals, BlueCard Program Manual, CFA contract, and other necessary information) provided by\nTaxpayer to substantiate the nature and amount of the Host deductions. Taxpayer\u2019s participation in the Inter-Plan Programs, as required by Member Standard 5, is not pursuant to\na cost-plus contract. Taxpayer does not have a benefit policy or cost-plus contract with a member, an\nemployer group or a national account. Taxpayer did not adjudicate the Member\u2019s entitlement to the\ninsurance coverage. What Taxpayer has is a License from the Association, pursuant to which Taxpayer\nis required to provide claim processing services and access to benefits under its provider contracts. Further, Taxpayer\u2019s contractual reimbursement arrangements with its network of providers are not costbased contracts, but are service contracts. None of these arrangements constitute obligations imposed\nupon Taxpayer under a cost-plus contract. Accordingly, inclusion of the Host amounts in the calculation of Taxpayer\u2019s special deduction under \u00a7 833\nmust not be allowed. This writing may contain privileged information.
