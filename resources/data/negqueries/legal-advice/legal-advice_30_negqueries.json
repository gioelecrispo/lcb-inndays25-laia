The taxpayer argues that denial of the accrued interest deductions pursuant to\nTreas.

Protest at p. 24. Specifically, the taxpayer states that \u201c[t]he U.S.- Country\nA Treaty contains a non-discrimination provision in Article --- which is designed to\nprovide that U.S. and Country A persons \u2018must be treated similarly\u2019 if they are\n\u2018comparably situated.\u2019\u201d Id.

As discussed below, the taxpayer\u2019s position that Treas. Reg. \u00a71.267-3(a) violates\nthe nondiscrimination provision of the U.S.- Country A Treaty is erroneous for various\nreasons. The Term \u201cPaid\u201d Does Not Automatically include \u201cAccrual\u201d 3 Treas. Reg. \u00a71.267(a)-3(b) states: \u201c[d]eduction of amount owed to related foreign person--(1) In\ngeneral. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, section 267(a)(3) requires a taxpayer to use\nthe cash method of accounting with respect to the deduction of amounts owed to a related foreign person. An amount that is owed to a related foreign person and that is otherwise deductible under Chapter 1 thus\nmay not be deducted by the taxpayer until such amount is paid to the related foreign person. . .\u201d\n(emphasis added.) POSTF-108700-08 6 First, the taxpayer is arguing that the term \u201cpaid\u201d should include \u201cpaid or\naccrued.\u201d Protest at 26. However, the plain language of the nondiscrimination clause,\nas highlighted above, specifically states that interest paid by an enterprise of one State\nto a resident of the other State shall be deductible under the same conditions as if they\nhad been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. The plain language of this\nprovision is clear that the interest must be actually paid to the foreign resident. The\ntreaty provision does not say \u201cpaid or accrued\u201d nor does the Treasury Technical\nExplanation of the Convention Between the U.S. and the Country A ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------(the \u201cTreasury Explanation\u201d) indicate that the drafters\nof the treaty intended for \u201cpaid\u201d to mean \u201cpaid or accrued\u201d in this circumstance. The U.S.- Country A Tax Treaty does not expressly define the term \u201cpaid.\u201d However, Article -----of the treaty provides that in the applying the treaty, any term used\nbut not defined in the treaty will have the meaning that it has under the law of the State\nwho is imposing the tax unless the context requires otherwise. Article -----further states\nthat if a term is defined under both the tax and non-tax laws of the State, the definition in\nthe tax law will take precedence over the definition in the non-tax law. Thus, we must\nlook to U.S. tax law first for the meaning of \u201cpaid\u201d in this context where the U.S. is\nimposing the tax at issue.",

The term \u201cpaid\u201d is not explicitly defined in the Internal Revenue Code, however,\nwe can look to the courts for guidance on the definition of \u201cpaid\u201d for purposes of U.S. tax\nlaw. Specifically, the Board of Tax Appeals has stated that \u201c[i]n common parlance the\nword \u2018paid\u2019 does not necessarily import an unpaid accrual.\u201d Maryland Land &\nTransportation Corp. v. Com\u2019r, 40 B.T.A. 1067, 1069 (1939)(holding that the petitioner\u2019s\nargument that \u201cdividends accrued\u201d during a tax year should be deemed \u201cdividends paid\u201d\nfor purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7351 would \u201cfrustrate the very purpose which the statute was\nintended to accomplish.\u201d) The taxpayer would have you believe that the word \u201cpaid\u201d\ninevitably implies \u201cpaid or accrued,\u201d but as the Board of Tax Appeals has found in\nMaryland Land, that is not the common meaning. Further, the Supreme Court has stated that in determining the meaning of\nlanguage in the treaty context: \u201c[t]he clear import of treaty language controls unless\n\u2018application of the words of the treaty according to their obvious meaning effects a result\ninconsistent with the intent or expectations of its signatories.\u2019 \u201d U.S. v. Stuart, 489 U.S.\n353, 363 (1989) (citing Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U.S. 176, 180,\n102 S.Ct. 2374, 2377, 72 L.Ed.2d 765 (1982), quoting Maximov v. United States, 373\nU.S. 49, 54, 83 S.Ct. 1054, 1057, 10 L.Ed.2d 184 (1963)). The Supreme Court\u2019s\nposition that the clear import of the treaty language controls further strengthens our\nargument that the plain language of the treaty should be respected and should not be\nread to expand the meaning of the term \u201cpaid\u201d to something it was not specifically\nintended to include. POSTF-108700-08 7 Therefore, based on the plain language of the treaty provision, the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s position that the clear import of treaty language controls and the Board of Tax\nAppeals statement that \u201cpaid\u201d does not import an unpaid accrual, Counsel believes that\nthe taxpayer should not be able to insert \u201cpaid or accrued\u201d as the meaning for the plain\nlanguage of the treaty provision which states that the interest must actually be \u201cpaid\u201d to\nthe foreign resident. ------is Treated Similarly to a U.S. Cash-Basis Taxpayer\nSecond, the taxpayer suggests that if it had accrued interest expense payable to\na lender who was a domestic corporation the deduction would be permitted. This is an\naccurate description of the legal treatment if the domestic corporation used the accrual\nmethod of accounting. However, if a domestic corporation accrued an amount of\ninterest to a related domestic person that used the cash receipts and disbursements\nmethod of accounting, the cash basis domestic corporation would not be allowed a\ndeduction until it actually paid the interest to that person. Thus, domestic corporations\nmaking payments to related foreign corporations are effectively subject to the same\n\u201cmatching principle\u201d as domestic corporations making payments to related domestic\ncorporations: a deduction will be \u201callowable as of the day as of which such amount is\nincludible in the gross income of the person to whom the payment is made.\u201d See I.R.C.\n\u00a7 267(a)(2).",

The\ntaxpayer even cites to the Treasury Explanation in support of its position. Id. However, if one reads the Treasury Explanation regarding the nondiscrimination\nprovision, it explains that Article --------is not a sweeping prohibition on any differences\nin tax treatment of U.S. and foreign corporations; rather, it forbids different tax treatment\nof such corporations only where the difference is conditioned on the domestic or foreign POSTF-108700-08 8 status of the taxpayer corporation. Treasury Explanation------------------------4 It explains\nthat the nondiscrimination provision applies only if the foreign and U.S. corporations are\n\u201ccomparably situated,\u201d and that corporations are not comparably situated if there is a\ntax-relevant difference in their situations. Id. Specifically, it provides that regardless of\nwhether the language of Article --- refers to entities \u201cin the same circumstances,\u201d\n\u201ccarrying on the same activities,\u201d or that are \u201csimilar,\u201d ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Id. By way of example, the Technical Explanation notes\nthat different tax treatment would be justified where one person was taxable on\nworldwide income but the other was not, or if tax could be collected from one person at\na later stage but not from the other. Id. In our facts, ----- had a tax-relevant difference in its situation as compared to a\nhypothetical U.S. corporation. The hypothetical U.S. corporation would be taxed in the\nU.S. on its world-wide income whereas ----- would not be taxed in the U.S. on its worldwide income. As explicitly discussed in the Treasury Explanation, this is a tax-relevant\ndifference that makes------ not comparably situated to a hypothetical U.S. corporation. Therefore, application of Treas.

U.S. source interest\npayable to a Country A corporation is not subject to U.S. tax as the interest accrues, as\nin the case of an amount payable to a domestic corporation or even a foreign\ncorporation that reports the interest as effectively connected with a trade or business in\nthe United States. This is also a tax-relevant difference between a U.S. payee and a\nforeign payee. Thus, the disallowance of a deduction for interest expense accrued but\nnot paid to a foreign lender is directly related to a tax-relevant difference and such\ndifference in treatment is not discriminatory under Article --------of the Treaty. In sum, Treas. Reg. \u00a71.267-3(a) does not compel different tax treatment of\ncorporations conditioned solely on the domestic or foreign status of the taxpayer\ncorporation. As discussed above, ----- is \u201ccomparably situated\u201d to and is being treated\nsimilarly to a U.S. corporation that is on the cash method of accounting. ----- in not is\n\u201ccomparably situated\u201d to a U.S. corporation that is taxable on its world-wide income, nor\nis it is \u201ccomparably situated\u201d to a U.S. or foreign corporation that is taxable on its U.S.\nsource interest. Thus, Treas. Reg. \u00a71.267-3(a) does not violate the nondiscrimination\nprovision of the U.S.- Country A Tax Treaty. II. Whether Treas. Reg. \u00a71.267-3(a) is valid as a permissible\nconstruction of the relevant statutory provisions. The taxpayer argues, in somewhat of a last ditch effort, that Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.2673(a) is \u201cinconsistent with the plain meaning of section 267(a)(3) and does not represent\na reasonable interpretation of section 267(a)(3).\u201d Protest at 30. This argument has\nbeen addressed and dismissed by the Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle, Inc. v. Com\u2019r, 87\nF.3d 99 (1996), the Seventh Circuit in Square D Co. and Subs v. Com\u2019r, 438 F.3d 739\n(2006), and the Tax Court in Square D Co. and Subs v. Com\u2019r,118 T.C. 299 (2002). Nonetheless, we will address the taxpayer\u2019s argument below. Authority Granted to the Secretary to Promulgate Regulations The regulation at issue here, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.267(a)\u20133, was promulgated under\nthe statutory directive that \u201c[t]he Secretary shall by regulations apply the matching\nprinciple of paragraph (2) in cases in which the person to whom the payment is to be\nmade is not a United States person.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3). Such a regulation, adopted\npursuant to a specific grant of statutory authority, is known as a \u201clegislative\u201d regulation. (e.g., Krukowski v. Commissioner, 279 F.3d 547, 551 (7th Cir 2002); Gehl Co. v.\nCommissioner, 795 F.2d 1324, 1328 (7th Cir. 1986)). It is well settled that a legislative\nregulation must be upheld unless it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to\n[the] statute.\u201d",

It is well settled that a legislative\nregulation must be upheld unless it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to\n[the] statute.\u201d Krukowski, 279 F.3d at 551 (quoting Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res.\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984)). Thus, \u201c[w]here the Commissioner POSTF-108700-08 10 acts under specific authority, [the Court\u2019s] primary inquiry is whether the interpretation or\nmethod is within the delegation of authority.\u201d Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U.S.\n247, 253 (1981). Under authority expressly delegated to him, the Secretary of the Treasury\nadopted regulations providing that a taxpayer owing interest to a related foreign party is\nentitled to a deduction for that interest only at the time the interest is paid. The effect of\nthe regulation is to place accrual basis taxpayers on the cash basis method of\naccounting with respect to such interest obligations. As stated above, the Tax Court in\nSquare D Co. and Subs v. Com\u2019r,118 T.C. 299 (2002), the Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle,\nInc. v. Com\u2019r, 87 F.3d 99 (1996) and the Seventh Circuit in Square D Co. and Subs v.\nCom\u2019r, 438 F.3d 739 (2006) have all held the regulation valid under the authority\ndelegated to the Secretary by I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3), as a permissible interpretation of the\nstatutory scheme. The Supreme Court in Chevron laid out a two-step analysis to determine the\nvalidity of a regulation. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984). First, does the plain meaning of the relevant Code provision\nsupport the regulation and second, if the plain meaning is either silent or unclear as to\nthe regulations validity, then a court must evaluate the reasonableness of the\nCommissioner\u2019s determination. Square D & Subs. v. Com\u2019r, 438 F.3d 739, 744 (2006). Congress Remained Silent on How to Apply the Matching Principle of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2)\nI.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3) directs the Secretary to adopt regulations applying \u201cthe\nmatching principle\u201d of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) \u201cin cases in which the person to whom the\npayment is to be made is not a United States person.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3). The Tax Court\nin Square D discussed above, like the Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle, 87 F.3d at 104\u201305,\nheld that Congress had not \u201cspoken to the precise question at issue,\u201d but rather had\nremained \u201csilent or ambiguous\u201d as to how the Secretary should apply that matching\nprinciple. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842. Thus, once it has been determined that \u201cthe statute is silent or ambiguous with\nrespect to the specific issue,\u201d how to specifically apply the matching principle of I.R.C. \u00a7\n267(a)(2), the second inquiry under the Supreme Court\u2019s Chevron doctrine is whether\nthe regulation \u201cis based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d Chevron, 467\nU.S. at 843. The Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle held the regulation valid because it \u201cis not\nmanifestly contrary to section 267(a)(3).\u201d 87 F.3d at 105.",

Similarly, the Tax Court in\nSquare D concluded that \u201c[r]egardless of whether petitioner or respondent (with whom\nwe happen to agree) has the better interpretation\u201d of the statute, the Secretary\u2019s\n\u201cconstruction, as embodied in the challenged regulation, is a permissible one,\u201d and,\n\u201c[u]nder the Chevron doctrine, that settles the matter.\u201d 118 T.C. 299 at *312. POSTF-108700-08 11\nPermissible Application of the Matching Principle When trying to determine how the matching principle of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) should\nbe applied, one argument is that it only applies where there is a timing mismatch in\nitems of income and deduction between related taxpayers due to differences in\naccounting methods, and that if the mismatch is not due to a difference in accounting\nmethod, the matching principle of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) does not apply. This notion is\nincorrect. In the first place, I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) does not use the term \u201cmatching\nprinciple\u201d that the Secretary is directed in I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3) to apply by regulation, nor\ndoes any other section of the Internal Revenue Code use that exact term. Thus,\nnothing in the plain language of the statute requires that the matching principle be\ndefined as only including a difference in accounting methods. Further, when Congress enacted the present version of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) in\n1984, it was directed at mismatches in income and deduction that occurred as a result\nof differences in accounting methods, because it was that narrow situation that\nCongress viewed as giving rise to abuse, and thus a difference in accounting methods\nwas made the \u201ctrigger.\u201d In I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3), Congress directed the Secretary to issue\nregulations addressing other circumstances in which mismatches occur when foreign\nentities are involved, but it does not further specify what those circumstances are. Rather, the statute delegates broad authority to the Secretary to determine when, and\nunder what circumstances, \u201cthe matching principle of\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) should be\napplied. As Judge Swift reasoned in his Tax Court dissent in Tate & Lyle, 103 T.C. at\n681: It is apparent that a treaty may represent the\nreason and cause for a mismatch in the tax\nreporting and treatment of items of income and\nexpense as between domestic taxpayers and\nrelated foreign parties, and the conclusion is\ncompelling that [the Secretary] has been\ndelegated regulatory authority under section\n267(a)(3) to provide that such a reason and cause\nfor a mismatch will trigger the correction\ncontemplated by section 267. The bottom line is that what Congress did in I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3) was instruct the\nSecretary to issue regulations defining other circumstances in which the matching\nprinciple of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) should apply when foreign entities are involved. Congress did not instruct the Secretary to limit the triggering mechanism to the\napplication of the regulation to differences engendered by a method of accounting. Thus, the application of the plain meaning rule here makes clear that Congress granted\nthe Secretary broad authority to determine when, and under what circumstances, the\nmatching principle of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) should be applied.

POSTF-108700-08 12 This is even more apparent when the words of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3) are considered\n\u201cin their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d FDA v.\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000). I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3)\ndirects the Secretary to \u201capply the matching principle of paragraph (2) in cases in which\nthe person to whom the payment is to be made is not a United States person.\u201d Nothing\nin I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) itself, however, says that that provision does not apply where \u201cthe\nperson to whom the payment is to be made is not a United States person.\u201d On the\ncontrary, taken alone, its terms establish that it does. I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) makes no\ndistinction between transactions between two domestic taxpayers and those between a\ndomestic taxpayer and a foreign entity. Thus, as the Third Circuit explained, if \u201cthe plain\nmeaning of section 267(a)(3) requires the Secretary to apply exactly the same matching\nprinciple of section 267(a)(2) to foreign persons, then the language of section 267(a)(3)\nis redundant.\u201d Tate & Lyle, 87 F.3d at 104. To avoid redundancy, I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3)\nmust be understood as authorizing something broader. Taxpayer Argues that the Regulation Violates the \u201cPlain Meaning\u201d of I.R.C. \u00a7267(a)(3) The taxpayer argues that \u201cbecause ----- would not have included the interest\nincome in income for U.S. tax purposes under Article --- of the U.S.- Country A Treaty,\nthe matching concepts underlying sections 267(a)(2) and 267(a)(3) should not be\napplied. Section 267(a)(2) was designed to address timing issues only when income is\nincluded for U.S. tax purposes . . .\u201d Protest at 29-30. In other words, taxpayer contends\nthat the plain meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3) requires regulations allowing companies in\nits situation to deduct interest when accrued, and that the Treas. Reg. 1.267(a)\u20133\nviolates this \u201cplain meaning\u201d by forcing it to use the cash accounting method. The taxpayer is correct in pointing out that there is a \u201cmismatch\u201d between ------(non taxable) income and ------------------------ (deductible) interest expense, but the\nstatute does not dictate exactly how this mismatch is to be resolved. The resolution of\nthe problem is delegated to the Secretary to address by regulation. As the Third Circuit\nrecognized, the literal terms of I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(2) would suggest that a taxpayer would\nnot be entitled to any deduction: \u201cif the matching principle of section 267(a)(2) was\nstrictly applied here, the U.S. payor would never be entitled to an interest deduction\nbecause the related foreign payee would never have to include interest in taxable\nincome under a tax treaty with the United States.\u201d Tate & Lyle, 87 F.3d at 104. It was\nto avoid this result, which Congress viewed as \u201cunduly harsh,\u201d that the Secretary was\nauthorized to address, by regulation, amounts owed to foreign payees.",

It was\nto avoid this result, which Congress viewed as \u201cunduly harsh,\u201d that the Secretary was\nauthorized to address, by regulation, amounts owed to foreign payees. But the statute\ncertainly does not specify whether the Secretary was to apply the matching principle by,\nas taxpayer suggests, allowing payees in its situation an immediate deduction when\ninterest is accrued, or, as the Secretary determined in the Treasury Regulation, allowing\na deduction only when the interest is paid. Moreover, the assumption underlying taxpayer\u2019s argument, that because the\ninterest income is exempt from tax by treaty, there is nothing to match against, is\nmistaken. As Judge Gerber explained in his Tax Court dissent in Tate & Lyle, 103 T.C. POSTF-108700-08 13 at 683\u2013684, \u201cCongress did not relieve taxpayers from the requirements of section 267\nwhere one of the related members is tax-exempt under section 501,\u201d and it thus \u201cdoes\nnot follow that, if an entity is exempt from tax and the related entities are subject to\nsection 267, an otherwise taxable entity that is exempt from some portion of its income,\nespecially under a treaty, would result in the related entities\u2019 not being subject to section\n267.\u201d As Judge Gerber further explained, \u201cit does not follow that\u2014because the income\nis tax-exempt, it is or becomes nonexistent for purposes of the accounting method\nrequirements of sections 881(a)(1), 1442(a), and 267. The character of income is not\nchanged simply because a treaty provides relief from part or all of the tax of one of the\ntreaty countries. Rather, the [treaty] simply has the effect of eliminating the U.S. tax.\u201d 103 T.C. at 684. In sum, as the Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle observed, \u201c[t]he legislative history of\nsection 267(a)(3) reveals that Congress anticipated other reasons [than a difference in\naccounting methods] for the mismatch of interest expense and income between related\npersons, which would defer the deduction of interest expense until actually paid.\u201d 87\nF.3d at 105. Instead, as the Tax Court in Square D explained, \u201cthe scope of the\nregulations under Section 267(a)(3) is generally determined by the presence or absence\nof a U.S. method of accounting for the income in the hands of the foreign recipient,\nwhere the U.S. payor seeks to accrue a deduction with respect to that item.\u201d Square D,\n118 T.C. 299 at *312. Both the Senate and the House reports on I.R.C. \u00a7 267(a)(3)\nmake clear, as the Third Circuit in Tate & Lyle observed, 87 F.3d at 105, that Congress\ncontemplated that the Commissioner might combat such abuse by applying I.R.C. \u00a7\n267(a)(3) to situations where the payee was not ultimately subject to tax on the amount\nreceived. In Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.267(a)\u20133, the Secretary did no more than what the House\nand Senate reports said he could do. The Secretary adopted a rule providing that\nwhere an accrual basis United States taxpayer accrues interest payable to a related\nforeign payee, the United States taxpayer is allowed a deduction only when the interest\nis paid. Therefore, as found by the Seventh Circuit, the Third Circuit and the Tax Court,\nthe regulation is based on a permissible construction of the statute and should be\nupheld. III.",
