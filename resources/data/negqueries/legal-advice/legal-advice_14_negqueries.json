He approached\nabout his idea\nin 1997. agreed that this plan was enticing and\nbegan selling some of its payphones to individuals looking for a\ngood annual return and tax advantages. Thereafter,\nformed\non\n,\n1998, to market payphones which allegedly complied with the\nAmericans With Disabilities Act (ADA). These payphones had\nlonger cords, volume controls, and other minor improvements which\nallowed their use by the disabled. sold the disabled accessible payphones to investors for\na price of $\n($\nafter April 1999) per phone. purchased these payphones new or refurbished from manufacturers\nat a wholesale cost of $\nto $\nper phone. For the\npurchase price, the investor purportedly received ownership of a\npayphone at a location solely selected by\n. A purchaser of an\npayphone had four options upon purchase. The first option\nrequired that the purchaser handle all aspects of the phone's\nmaintenance and earnings. Two other options transferred some of\nthe phone's responsibility to\n. Ninety percent of the\npurchasers chose Option Four. Under Option Four, the purchaser of the payphone entered\ninto, in essence, a sale and leaseback agreement with\n. then assumed total responsibility for collecting the coins\nfrom the phone, cleaning and maintaining the phone, accounting\nfor the profits, paying the expenses of the phone, such as the\ntelephone service provider, and issuing a check for the net\nprofits to the owner. Although the owner was supposed to receive\npercent of the net profits monthly,\nwas, in fact, paying\n1\na month regardless of the\nall investors a base amount of $\nphone's location. This payment generated a\npercent annual\nreturn to the purchasers.

In addition, some investors were advised to claim\nthe other half of the purchase price as a section 179 deduction. A tax opinion was provided from\nwhich\nsaid that the payphone qualified for the section 44 credit\nalthough this opinion contained no real discussion how this\ninvestment so qualified. The sale of the\npayphones has been attacked by several\nstate securities commissions and the SEC. These governmental\nagencies contend that the payphone investment is a \"security\"\nwhich must be registered with them. On\n, 2002, the United\nStates District Court for the District of\nissued a\npermanent injunction barring\nfrom selling unregistered\nsecurities. ceased selling the payphone investment in\n, 2001.\n.

To date, the Receiver has no information\nthat would suggest that such payments will be\nforthcoming.

DISCUSSION\nSection 165(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that\nthere shall be allowed as a deduction any loss sustained during\nthe taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or\notherwise. I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c) provides that in the case of an individual,\nthe deduction under subsection (a) is limited to losses incurred\nin a trade or business; losses incurred in any transaction\nentered into for profit, though not connected with a trade or\nbusiness; and losses of property not connected with a trade or\nbusiness if such losses arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, or\nother casualty, or from theft. Section 1.165-1(c) of the Income Tax Regulations provides\nthat the amount of the loss allowable as a deduction shall not\nexceed the adjusted basis for determining the loss from the sale\nor other disposition of the property involved, as prescribed by\n\u00a7 1.1011-1. Accordingly, to the extent an investor has claimed a\ndepreciation deduction or an ADA credit with regard to the\ninvestment in taxable years that are closed and not audited, the\nloss deduction will be reduced. - 5 The question may arise as to which of two sections allows\nthe loss deduction: I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c)(2), which allows individuals\nto deduct losses incurred in transactions entered into for\nprofit, or I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c)(3), which allows individuals to deduct\nlosses from theft. The distinction matters because I.R.C. \u00a7\n165(h) limits the deductibility of I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c)(3) theft\nlosses but does not limit I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c)(2) losses. From what we have heard about the investor pool, we expect\nthat most investors invested in the payphones with an expectation\nof making a profit4. Also, although the promoters may have\nengaged in activities that violate federal and state securities\nlaws, the record does not indicate that these actions resulted in\ntheft losses. Accordingly, the investors\u2019 losses are allowable\nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 165(c)(2) and are not limited by I.R.C. \u00a7 165(h). Investors were promised a minimum 14 percent return on their\ninvestments and had a motive other than tax avoidance to invest. Nevertheless, auditors who encounter investors who clearly made\nthe investment solely for the tax benefits and who did not rely\non false statements in deciding to invest may determine that no\nloss is allowable. We stress that based on our knowledge of the\ntypical investor, disallowance of a loss will be the exception\nrather than the rule. Having determined that investors will generally be entitled\nto a loss deduction, we turn to the question of the tax year in\nwhich the loss will be allowed. Section 1.165-1(d)(1) provides that a loss is allowed for\nthe taxable year in which the loss is sustained, as evidenced by\nclosed and completed transactions and as fixed by identifiable\nevents occurring in such taxable year. We conclude, subject to the exceptions mentioned, that\ninvestors in the\npayphone scheme incurred a\ndeductible loss in 2003 5. Prior to 2002, the trustee was hopeful\n4 If Examiners find investors who clearly made the\ninvestment to obtain the bogus tax advantages, no loss should be\nallowed as discussed elsewhere in this memorandum. 5",

Those investors might not be\nentitled to deduct the loss until a later year when the suit is\nresolved.

Thus, he believed\nthat some recovery was possible. A year later, in his\n2003 letter, the receiver concluded that there would not be\nsufficient money in the receivership/bankruptcy estate to pay\ninvestors anything. The receiver's opinion as one deeply\nfamiliar with\nfinances should be given substantial\nweight. See Premji v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1996-304, aff'd,\n98-1 USTC \u00b650,218 (10 th Cir. 1998). ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS Examiners should consider entering closing agreements with\ninvestors under audit. The agreements should allow taxpayers to\ndeduct the loss on their\nreturns with the proviso that they\nwill include any ultimate distributions in income in the year of\nreceipt. Of course, any amounts received from\nbefore\n2001 (the date of the bankruptcy) are includible in income. Although the receiver informed investors that he would not issue\nthem 1099 forms for amounts paid to them before the bankruptcy\nduring 2001, those amounts are taxable and are not a return of\ncapital as stated by the receiver.
