ISSUES POSTF-140035-12 2 1. Whether a penalty under section 6662 for negligence or disregard of rules or\nregulations should apply to the underpayment attributable to Taxpayer\u2019s reporting\nof its open-air parking structures as land improvements with 15-year depreciable\nlives, rather than as buildings with 39-year depreciable lives? 2. Whether Taxpayer had reasonable cause and acted in good faith under\nsection 6664, which is a defense to an accuracy-related penalty? CONCLUSIONS 1. There is a legally sufficient basis to apply a penalty for negligence or disregard of\nrules or regulations. The decision of whether to apply the penalty, however, rests\nwith the IRS team manager. 2. Taxpayer has not demonstrated that it has met the reasonable cause and good\nfaith exception to an accuracy-related penalty.

For purposes of depreciation under section 168, the depreciation recovery period is\ngenerally determined by class life.

Conclusions reached in\ntreatises, legal periodicals, legal opinions or opinions rendered by tax\nprofessionals are not authority.

In the case of court decisions, for example, a district court\nopinion on an issue is not an authority if overruled or reversed by the United\nStates Court of Appeals for such district. However, a Tax Court opinion is\nnot considered to be overruled or modified by a court of appeals to which a\ntaxpayer does not have a right of appeal, unless the Tax Court adopts the\nholding of the court of appeals. Similarly, a private letter ruling is not\nauthority if revoked or if inconsistent with a subsequent proposed\nregulation, revenue ruling or other administrative pronouncement published\nin the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Reasonable Cause and Good Faith The accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 does not apply to the extent that a\ntaxpayer has reasonable cause for the underpayment and the taxpayer acted in good\nfaith with respect to such portion. 34 The regulations explain the analysis to be\nconducted to determine if a taxpayer acted with reasonable cause and in good faith as\n34 Section 6664(c)(1); sections 1.6662-3(a) and 1.6664-4(a).

Generally, the most important factor is\nthe extent of the taxpayer\u2019s effort to assess the taxpayer\u2019s proper tax\nliability. Circumstances that may indicate reasonable cause and good faith\ninclude an honest misunderstanding of fact or law that is reasonable in light\nof the all the facts and circumstances, including the experience,\nknowledge, and education of the taxpayer. An isolated computational error\nor transcriptional error generally is not inconsistent with reasonable cause\nand good faith. Reliance on an information return or on the advice of a\nprofessional tax advisor or an appraiser does not necessarily demonstrate\nreasonable cause and good faith. Similarly, reasonable cause and good\nfaith is not necessarily indicated by reliance on facts that, unknown to the\ntaxpayer, are incorrect. Reliance on an information return, professional\nadvice, or other facts, however, constitutes reasonable cause and good\nfaith if, under all the circumstances, such reliance was reasonable and the\ntaxpayer acted in good faith. (See paragraph (c) of this section for certain\nrules relating to reliance on the advice of others.) \u2026. The regulation regarding reliance on opinion or advice states:36\nReliance on opinion or advice \u2013 (1) Facts and circumstances;\nminimum requirements. All facts and circumstances must be taken into\naccount in determining whether a taxpayer has reasonably relied in good\nfaith on advice (including the opinion of a professional tax advisor) as to\nthe treatment of the taxpayer (or any entity, plan, or arrangement) under\nFederal tax law. For example, the taxpayer\u2019s education, sophistication\nand business experience will be relevant in determining whether the\ntaxpayer\u2019s reliance on tax advice was reasonable and made in good faith. In no event will a taxpayer be considered to have reasonably relied in\ngood faith on advice (including an opinion) unless the requirements of this\nparagraph (c)(1) are satisfied. The fact that these requirements are\nsatisfied, however, will not necessarily establish that the taxpayer\nreasonably relied on the advice (including the opinion of a tax advisor) in\ngood faith. For example, reliance may not be reasonable or in good faith if\nthe taxpayer knew, or reasonably should have known, that the advisor\nlacked knowledge in the relevant aspects of Federal tax law. 35\n36 Section 1.6664-4(b)(1).\nSection 1.6664-4(c).

In addition, the requirements of this\nparagraph (c)(1) are not satisfied if the taxpayer fails to disclose a fact\nthat it knows, or reasonably should know, to be relevant to the proper\ntax treatment of an item. (ii) No unreasonable assumptions.

POSTF-140035-12 13 appropriate.38 IRS Compliance and Taxpayer agree that Rev. Proc. 87-56 sets forth the\nclass life and recovery period of land improvements, which excludes buildings, as\ndefined in section 1.48-1(e) of the regulations. 39 Thus, the issue requires determining\nwhether the parking structures are buildings under section 1.48-1(e). To have a reasonable basis, Taxpayer\u2019s position must be \u201creasonably based\u201d on the\napplicable authorities. 40 The authorities must be relevant and must not ignore contrary\nauthorities. 41 Taxpayer advanced numerous arguments as to why it should prevail on\nthe underlying issue and, therefore, why it has a reasonable basis. As explained herein,\nTaxpayer\u2019s arguments are not reasonably based on the applicable law and Taxpayer is\nignoring the language in section 1.48-1(e) and in relevant case law. As a result, at best,\nTaxpayer\u2019s return position is merely arguable or merely a colorable claim. Therefore,\nTaxpayer does not have a reasonable basis for its return position. Argument 1: Reasonable Basis based on Protest Arguments\nTaxpayer raised several arguments in the protest of its prior IRS examination (----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------) to support its position that a parking garage is a land improvement which\nhas a 15-year life, rather than a building, which has a 39-year life, for purposes of\ndepreciation. Taxpayer\u2019s arguments are (or appear to be):\n(A) Treasury Regulation section 1.48-1(e) is invalid because it added the words\n\u201cparking\u201d and \u201cgarage,\u201d where as the legislative history to the investment tax\ncredit did not include those words. 42\n(B) The parking structures do not appear as buildings. They do not have floor-toceiling walls, a conventional roof, and they do not share supporting structural\nelements. 43 38",

POSTF-140035-12 14 (C) The parking structures do not function as buildings because they provide only\nincidental working space, they offer only minimal shelter from the elements, they\noffer only limited protection from vandalism and theft, and their primary purpose\nis storage of vehicles. 44\n(D) A paved surface parking area is a land improvement under section 1.48-1(c); its\nparking structures are parking lots stacked one on top of another and, therefore,\nare land improvements. 45\n(E) Courts have rejected the IRS\u2019s literal interpretation of section 1.48-1(e)(1), which\nlists \u201cparking\u201d as a function and \u201cgarage\u201d as an example of a building. 46\n(F) A stand-alone parking structure is not a \u201cgarage\u201d and is therefore not a building\nunder section 1.48-1(e)(1).47 Protest Argument A \u2013 Validity of Section1.48-1(e) Taxpayer states that section 1.48-1(e) is broader than the legislative history regarding\nthe investment credit.48 Taxpayer appears to infer that the regulation, which is a\nlegislative regulation, is invalid. This argument has previously been rejected. 49\nAccordingly, Taxpayer\u2019s argument is improper and does not provide Taxpayer with a\nreasonable basis. Protest Argument B \u2013 Appearance Test\nTaxpayer states that, other than underground levels, the parking structures do not\ncontain floor-to-ceiling walls, they do not contain conventional roofs, they offer minimal\nshelter from the elements, and much of the parking decks were freely accessible to\npeople and animals. 50 Therefore, Taxpayer concludes that \u201cfacilities such as the\nparking decks differ in appearance from buildings in many important ways. \u201d51\nTaxpayer\u2019s argument addresses the so-called \u201cappearance test\u201d in section 1.48-1(e),\nwhich contains both the appearance test and a \u201cfunction\u201d test.

Taxpayer\u2019s argument is patently improper \u2013 a surface\nparking lot is different from a parking garage. 62 The parking structures are garages, the\npurpose of which is to provide parking.

For a taxpayer to have a reasonable basis, the position must be not frivolous\nand not patently improper. 63 Taxpayer\u2019s argument is both frivolous and patently\nimproper, reminding us of Abe Lincoln\u2019s riddle, \u201cHow many legs does a dog have if you\ncall a tail a leg? The answer is four, because calling a tail a leg does not make it one.\u201d64\nLike the tail, the parking structures should be recognized for what they are, not what\nTaxpayer professes them to be. This argument does not provide a reasonable basis for\nTaxpayer.

In those cases, the courts held that the storage facilities were not buildings,\nnotwithstanding that they could be considered warehouses. Taxpayer acknowledges\nthat the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has taken a different approach (i.e.,\ninterpreting the regulation literally), but states that \u201cthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit, the circuit to which [Taxpayer\u2019s] appeal would lie, is one of those \u2018other circuits\u2019\u201d\nthat follow the Tax Court\u2019s (non-literal) interpretation of the regulation. 67\n61 Taxpayer\u2019s Memo. -------.\nBabin v.

Second, Taxpayer is incorrect \u2013\nthe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit follows the approach originally enunciated by\nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In analyzing whether a refrigerated-storage structure was a building, the Tax Court, in\nsome of those cases, considered whether the purpose of the structure is to provide\nworking space for employees that is more than merely incidental to the main purpose of\nthe structure. 68 Upon review of a refrigerated storage case, the Court of Appeals for the\nEighth Circuit, in L&B Corp. v.

The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit explained the genesis of the Tax Court\u2019s\nincorrect interpretation:70\nThe Tax Court\u2019s departure from the original intent of Congress stems from\nits interpretation of Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. U.S., 538 F.2d 790\n(8th Cir. 1976). In Yellow Freight, this Court held that docks and\ninspection lanes constructed by a freight carrier constituted \u201cbuildings\u201d\nwithin the meaning of section 48(a)(1)(B). The loading docks and\ninspection lanes were permanent structures used to expedite freight and\nto inspect the long-haul vehicles. In a footnote to its discussion of the\n\u201cfunction\u201d test, this Court stated: We consider the amount of human activity which occurs\nwithin the structure an important consideration under\n\u00a7 48(a)(1)(B) since \u201cbuildings,\u201d according to Treas.

POSTF-140035-12 19 \u00a7 1.48-1(e), typically provide work space for such human\nactivity. The quantum of employee activity is, in our opinion,\ncritical in determining whether the function of a given\nstructure is principally, or only incidentally, to provide work\nspace. Yellow Freight, 538 F.2d at 797 n.11 (citations omitted). Footnote 11, discussing the amount of human activity carried on, was in\nresponse to a case in which the Ninth Circuit held that the nature of\nhuman activity was relevant to the definition of \u201cbuilding,\u201d but the amount\nof human activity was not. See Thirup v. Commissioner, 508 F.2d 915,\n919 (9th Cir. 1974), rev\u2019g 59 T.C. 122 (1972). Although this footnote may lend some support for the Tax Court\u2019s\napplication of the function test, the holding of Yellow Freight does not. In\nYellow Frieght, this Court held that loading docks and inspection lanes\nconstituted \u201cbuildings\u201d because the property provided \u201cshelter and work\nspace so that the men and equipment can perform their functions.\u201d Id. at\n796. This Court did not hold that only structures providing working space\nfor humans constitute \u201cbuildings.\u201d The issue in Thirup v.

To the\ncontrary, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found \u201cthe distinction based on\nhuman activity unpersuasive\u201d and employee activity was considered only to determine\nthe principle function of the structure.

Commissioner, 508 F.2d 915, 917 (9th Cir. 1974). Thirup v. Commissioner, 508 F.2d at 919-920. POSTF-140035-12 20 of the enumerated functions of a \u201cbuilding.\u201d In Brown-Forman Distillers,\nsupra, and Satrum, supra, the courts distinguished Sunnyside Nurseries\non the ground that Sunnyside\u2019s employees spent more time inside the\ngreenhouses than, respectively, Brown-Forman\u2019s employees spent inside\nthe whiskey warehouses or Satrum\u2019s workers spent in the chicken coops. We find the distinction based on the amount of human activity\nunpersuasive. The proper inquiry, which goes to the nature of the\nemployee activity inside the structures, is \u201cwhether the structures provide\nworking space for employees that is more than merely incidental to the\nprincipal function or use of the structure.\u201d Brown-Forman Distillers Corp.\nv. U.S., 499 F.2d 1263, 1271 (Ct. Cl. 1974). See Robert E. Catron, 50\nT.C. 306, 316 (1968) (reviewed by the full Court). In Satrum, supra, employees worked in aisles between the rows of\nchicken cages inside the structures to collect eggs, feed chickens, and\nremove droppings. Workers also spent long periods of time inside the\nstructures removing thousands of chickens that were to be sent to market\nand replacing those chickens with younger birds. The Tax Court\ncharacterized these activities as \u201cmerely supporting of, and ancillary to,\u201d\nthe purpose of the chickens and expressly found the structures did not\nprovide working space. 62 T.C. at 417. In our judgment, the activities of\nthe Thirups\u2019 greenhouses employees were, without a doubt, of the same\nsupportive and ancillary nature as the activities of the workers in Satrum. That flowers may require more human care than chickens is not a\nsufficient reason for deciding that greenhouses are \u201cbuildings\u201d while\nchicken coops are not. We conclude that under the functional test, the Thirups\u2019 greenhouses do\nnot function as \u201cbuildings,\u201d as that term is employed in section 48. The\ngreenhouses supply the controlled environment that is essential to the\ncommercial production of more and finer cut flowers, a function neither\nenumerated in Treasury Regulation 1.48-1(e)(1) nor sufficiently similar to\nthe enumerated functions to be within their scope.",

Similarly, in another case, Consolidated Freightways, Inc. v. Commissioner, when\napplying the function test in section 1.48-1(e), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,\nsaid: \u201cIf it functions as a building because, for example, it furnishes working space to its\nemployees, it is then necessary to consider the relationship between the \u2018nature\u2019 of the\nemployee activities inside the structure and the structure\u2019s primary function\u2026. \u201d73\n(Emphasis added.) Thus, from this language, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nstates that the function of employee work space is not necessary for classification as a\nbuilding. In that opinion, the 9th Circuit court further stated, \u201cIt is true that the Thirup\n73 Consolidated Freightways, Inc. v. Commissioner, 708 F.2d 1385, 1388 (9th Cir. 1983). POSTF-140035-12 21 court [a decision by the 9th Circuit] found \u2018unpersuasive\u2019 the distinction between\nbuildings and other structures based on the amount of human activity in the same\nstructures.\u201d74 These cases further support that Taxpayer incorrectly stated that the 9th\nCircuit applies a non-literal interpretation of section 1.48-1(e). In a third case decided by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Tamura v. U.S.,75\nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit did not consider human activity at all in its\nconclusion that an onion-storage shed was a building. The 9th Circuit concluded that\nthe onion shed was a building because it \u201cfunctions more like a barn, warehouse, or\ngarage (\u2018building[s]\u2019) than it does as a storage tank, silo, or coke oven (not \u2018building[s]\u2019). See Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.48-1(e)(1). No matter how you look at it, inside out, upside down,\nfrom the east or west, north or south, the structure, even in common parlance, is a\nbuilding. \u201d76\nTaxpayer cited no (accurate) authority for its proposition that the Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit applies a non-literal interpretation of section 1.48-1(e). As discussed\nherein, the case law reflects that the authority states the contrary: the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit interprets the language in section 1.48-1(e) literally. Misreading\ncases does not provide Taxpayer with reasonable basis.77 Protest Argument F \u2013 Parking Structure is Not a Garage\nTaxpayer acknowledges that an example of a building in section 1.48-1(e) includes a\ngarage, but states that \u201cgarage\u201d is not defined in the regulation or in case law because it\n\u201chas a commonly accepted definition.\u201d78 That definition, Taxpayer states, \u201cis a fully\nenclosed structure that protects vehicles from the elements, theft, and vandalism. \u201d79\n74 Consolidated Freightways, Inc. v.

First, Taxpayer refers to its parking structures as garages. 82 Second, to a varying\nextent, Taxpayer\u2019s parking structures provide protection from the elements. Third,\nTaxpayer\u2019s parking structures provide security. As support for Taxpayer\u2019s conclusion, Taxpayer cites McManus v. U.S., 863 F.2d 491\n(7th Cir. 1988).

Therefore, the opinion of an\nIRS Appeal\u2019s officer of the merits of the issue is not \u201cauthority\u201d upon which reasonable\nbasis can be determined and does not provide Taxpayer with reasonable basis.85 Argument 3: No Disregard of Regulation Because Researched Position Taken on\nReturn\nTaxpayer states that it did not disregard the rules or regulations because it \u201cwas clearly\naware of the regulation, did not disregard such regulation, and performed a substantial\namount of due diligence, as evidenced by the protest memorandums attached below, in\nsupporting the position taken on the return. \u201d86\n\u201cDisregard\u201d includes any careless, reckless or intentional disregard of rules or\nregulations. 87 The phrase \u201crules or regulations\u201d includes the provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code, temporary or final Treasury regulations issued under the\nCode, and revenue rulings or notices (other than notices of proposed rulemaking)\nissued by the Internal Revenue Service and published in the Internal Revenue\nBulletin.88 A disregard of rules or regulations is \u201ccareless\u201d if the taxpayer does not\nexercise reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return position\nthat is contrary to the rule or regulation. 89 A disregard is \u201cintentional\u201d if the\ntaxpayer knows of the rule or regulation that is disregarded.90 A taxpayer who\ntakes a position contrary to a revenue ruling or notice has not disregarded the\nruling or notice if the contrary position has a realistic possibility of being sustained\non its merits. 91 While Taxpayer researched the issue prior to reporting the\nposition on its tax return, its analysis misreads the regulation and the case law\ninterpreting the regulation. Given Taxpayer\u2019s knowledge, sophistication, and\nexperience, Taxpayer\u2019s analysis of the applicable authorities reflects that\nTaxpayer\u2019s efforts did not reflect an attempt to determine its correct tax liability. As discussed in this memo and in the Form 886-A explaining the underlying issue,\nTaxpayer does not have a realistic possibility of being sustained on the merits. Accordingly, Taxpayer disregarded the rules or regulations. 85",
