ISSUE\nWhether --------------------------. had a property interest in funds being withheld by\nthe City of -------------pursuant to a \u201cStop Notice.\u201d\nCONCLUSION Based on the discussion below, we conclude that --------------------------. had no\nproperty interest in the funds withheld pursuant to the \u201cStop Notice\u201d and that the funds\nbe returned to the City of -------------. ---------------------, Wrongful Levy Page 2 FACTS\n--------------------------------------------------- or \u201cthe taxpayer\u201d) has unpaid ---------------and -------------------- taxes in the amount of $----------------as follows:\nTax Period\nAmount Due\nType of Tax\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------contracted to provide improvements to property owned by the\nCity of -------------, California.

On ------------------, the City of -------------sent the Service a check in the amount of ---------------------, Wrongful Levy Page 3 $---------------, which was the amount that the City of -------------owed --------------------. On -------------------------, ----------------sent the Service an administrative wrongful\nlevy claim pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6343(b). DISCUSSION In cases where a taxpayer, after notice and demand, neglects or refuses to pay\ntax, the Service may file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (\u201cNFTL\u201d). I.R.C. \u00a7 6321. The\nNFTL reaches all property and rights to property, both real and personal, belonging to\nthe taxpayer. Id. A levy is an administrative means of collecting taxes by seizure of the taxpayer\u2019s\nproperty or rights to property to satisfy delinquent taxes. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6331. It is a\nsummary, extra-judicial remedy of self-help for the purpose of compelling payment of\nthe tax debt. See United States v. National Bank of Commerce, 472 U.S. 713, 720-21\n(1985) (a levy is a provisional remedy that protects the Government against diversion or\nloss while such claims are being resolved). See also Air Operations International Corp.\nv. United States, 2002-1 U.S.T.C. \u00b6 50,423 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (after a levy a third party\ncannot perfect a security interest in levied-upon funds).",

Fla. 2002) (after a levy a third party\ncannot perfect a security interest in levied-upon funds). In addition to reaching the\ntaxpayer\u2019s property, the levy also reaches any property transferred to a third party that\nis subject to a federal tax lien. Hans v. United States, 944 F.2d 526 (9th Cir. 1991);\nUnited States v. Donahue Industries, Inc., 905 F.2d 1325 (9th Cir. 1990). The Supreme Court recognized in United States v. National Bank of Commerce,\n472 U.S. 713, 721-22 (1985) that there are only two valid defenses to a third party\u2019s\nrefusal to surrender property upon demand: (1) the party is not in possession of nor\nobligated with respect to property or rights to property of the taxpayer; or (2) at the time\nof service of the Notice of Levy, the property or rights to property were subject to\nattachment or execution under judicial process. I.R.C. \u00a7 6332(a). This case turns on\nwhether ---------------------had a property interest in funds withheld pursuant to a \u201cStop\nNotice.\u201d Whether the taxpayer has a property interest in property is determined by state\nlaw. Drye v. United States, 528 U.S. 49, 58 (1999). If under state law, a prime\ncontractor-taxpayer has no property interest in funds due from the owner except in any\nsurplus that might remain after payment of the subcontractor, there can be no levy on\npayments owed the subcontractor. See United States v. Durham Lumber Co., 363 U.S.\n522 (1960). Since both ----------------and ---------------------are located in California, we\nlook to California law to determine if ---------------------had a property interest in the funds\nwithheld by the City of -------------. In California, a subcontractor providing materials to a general contractor is ---------------------, Wrongful Levy Page 4 entitled to a \u201cStop Notice\u201d upon failure of the general contractor to pay for materials\nused on the contract. Connolly Development, Inc. v. Superior Court of Merced County,\n17 Cal. 3d 803, 132 Cal. Rptr. 477 (Cal. Sup. Ct. 1976), appeal dismissed, 429 U.S.\n1056 (1976). The \u201cStop Notice\u201d involves a notice served on the owner or lender, which\nin turn gives notice to an owner to withhold payments to a general contractor, or gives\nnotice to a lender to withhold payment from the owner to a general contractor. In effect,\nthis allows a materialman or subcontractor to cause money to be earmarked for his\nbenefit. While a \u201cStop Notice\u201d does not constitute a mechanic\u2019s lien, it is a garnishment\nof the funds of the owner. Id. at 813. Any person entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien under Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3110, 3111 and\n3112, other than a general contractor, is entitled to give a \u201cStop Notice.\u201d Cal. Civ. Code\n\u00a7 3181. As a prerequisite to the serving of a \u201cStop Notice,\u201d the claimant must have\nserved a preliminary 20-day notice. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 3183(a). In this case, ---------------------filed a preliminary 20-day notice on ----------------------. Upon receipt of a \u201cStop Notice,\u201d the owner has the duty to withhold from the\ncontractor sufficient money to answer the claim, unless a payment bond is recorded.",

Upon receipt of a \u201cStop Notice,\u201d the owner has the duty to withhold from the\ncontractor sufficient money to answer the claim, unless a payment bond is recorded. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3186 (\u201cIt shall be the duty of the public entity, upon receipt of a stop\nnotice . . . to withhold from the original contractor . . . money or bonds . . . due or to\nbecome due to that contractor in an amount sufficient to answer the claim stated in the\nstop notice and to provide for the public entity\u2019s reasonable cost of any litigation\nthereunder.\u201d) California law prohibits the original contractor from making an assignment\nof money due under the contract once a stop notice has been filed. Id. \u00a7 3193. Further,\nany garnishment of, or statutory lien placed on such money will be \u201csubordinate to the\nrights of all stop notice claimants.\u201d Id. Thus, when ----------------filed the two \u201cStop\nNotices\u201d on -------------------, the City of -------------became obligated to withhold amounts\nowed to ---------------------under the contract. The filing of the \u201cStop Notices\u201d constituted\na lien on the funds being held by the City of -------------. The only legal precedent we have found directly discussing the effect of a \u201cStop\nNotice\u201d on the Service\u2019s levy is a Third Circuit case considering the lien laws of New\nJersey. The Court held that a taxpayer had no property interest in funds retained by a\ncontractor pursuant to a \u201cStop Notice.\u201d Shore Block Corp. v. Lakeview Apartments, 377\nF.2d 835 (3rd Cir. 1967). There, a subcontractor failed to pay a materialman. Id. at\n837-38. The materialman filed a \u201cStop Notice\u201d on January 29, 1965 with the contractor\nto withhold payments to the subcontractor. Id. Subsequently, the Service filed a lien for\nunpaid taxes of the subcontractor. Id. The Service then filed a levy on the funds\nwithheld pursuant to the \u201cStop Notice.\u201d Id. The court reasoned that the issue did not\nconcern lien priorities. Id. at 841. Rather, the issue was whether the subcontractor had\na property interest in the funds withheld pursuant to the \u201cStop Notice.\u201d Id. The court\nstated that \u201c [s]ince the subcontractor never had the right to obtain the garnished funds,\nneither could the United States assert a tax lien against them. Id. ---------------------, Wrongful Levy Page 5 Turning to California law, in United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company v. Oak\nGrove Union School District of Sonoma County, 205 Cal. App.2d 226, 230-31 (1962),\nthe court stated\n(1) In a public works contract there can be no lien against the property;\nhence the use of stop notices to provide protection to subcontractors\nagainst defaulting contractors. (2) In a sense the stop notice constitutes a\nlien on the property (earnings) of the contractor held by the owner. When\nthe notice is filed [sic] the claimant immediately has a right against those\nearnings held by the public agency. In effect, the filing imposes a trust\nobligation on the public agency.

The City of ---------------was effectively holding those funds in trust for ---------------. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3264 provides in relevant part that:\u201c[t]he rights of all persons\nfurnishing labor, services, equipment, or materials for any work of improvement, with\nrespect to any fund for payment of construction costs, are governed exclusively by [Cal\nCiv Code sections 3156 through 3214] . . . and no person may assert any legal or\nequitable right with respect to such fund, . . . .\u201c See Falcon Construction Co. v. United\nStates, 1988 WL 383111 (E.D. Cal. 1988) (holding that the Service could levy withheld\nfunds, in part because no stop notice had been filed); see also Pankow Construction\nCo. v. Advance Mortgage Corp. et al, 618 F.2d 611 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding that \u201cclaims\non construction loan funds by persons furnishing services or material are confined\u201d to\nmechanics liens and stop notices). Further, at least one appellate court in California\nhas interpreted sections 3186 and 3193 as imposing an \u201cabsolute statutory duty\u201d on\nowners \u201cto pay the valid amounts of [stop notice] claims to the stop notice claimants and\nno one else.\u201d Stanislaus Pump v. City of Modesto, 200 Cal. App.3d 1442, 1447, 246\nCal. Rptr. 601, 604 (5th Dist. 1988). However, this case evaluated the ability of the\ncontractor to make an assignment, and not a competing claim of the United States. There are no reported cases in the Ninth Circuit on the effect of a \u201cStop Notice\u201d\nwhen it is competing with a federal tax lien or levy. Some cases indicate that the Circuit\nwould recognize the stop notice as depriving a contractor of property interest in withheld\ncontract proceeds. See, e.g., United States v. J.D. Grainger Co., Inc., 945 F.2d 259,\n262 (9th Cir. 1991) (\u201cA number of courts have held that a taxpayer-contractor has no\nproperty interest . . . in funds held by a surety or withheld by the contracting party for\npayment of subcontractors or other creditors of the taxpayer.\u201d). On the other hand,\nsome cases indicate some hostility toward this theory. See, e.g., American Fidelity Fire\nIns. Co. v. United States, 385 F.Supp. 1075, 1078 (N.D. Cal. 1974) (finding no support\nfor the premise that once a stop notice is issued, \u201cpayments due the contractor become\nnot property of the contractor, but a trust fund for the payment of laborers and\nmaterialmen\u201d). ---------------------, Wrongful Levy Page 6 Because the \u201cStop Notice\u201d is not a mechanic\u2019s lien, but rather an equitable\nremedy under state law, the Service\u2019s position is that the federal tax lien would\nordinarily prime the \u201cStop Notice.\u201d",

See\nCalifornia Local Law Guide,\nhttp://ccintranet.prod.irscounsel.treas.gov/OrgStrat/Offices/sbse/Pages/CaliforniaLocal\nLaw.aspx. This position is based on the understanding that a contractor who has not\npaid his subcontractors could be deemed to have no property interest in the contract\nproceeds. See IRM 5.17.2.7.1.12(3). California case law has not explicitly answered\nthe questions whether a stop notice deprives a contractor of a property interest. However, it seems likely they would do so given the chance, based on the statutory duty\nto withhold funds. Therefore, we recommend that you return the $--------------to the City of ------------for a continued withholding of the funds subject to the Stop Notices filed by -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
