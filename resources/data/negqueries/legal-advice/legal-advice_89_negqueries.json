The\nterms of the sale called for \u201cinterest only payments\u201d for X years, at which time the\n$Amount 1 principal becomes due. At the time of the sale, the partnership,\nPartnership, had inventory of $ Amount 3which was later sold for a profit of\n$Amount 2. Of the $Amount 2 sale amount, Taxpayer's share was in excess of\n$Amount 4. Exam proposed a section 751 adjustment at the partnership level. POSTF-118310-12 2 Section 751 requires the seller to recognize ordinary income to the extent the fair\nmarket value of the inventory exceeded its basis. As a result of this adjustment,\nTaxpayer was to pick up ordinary income of $Amount 4 related to sale of the\ninventory. Taxpayer agreed to the section 751 adjustment and executed both\npart I of the Form 870 LT 1 and part II2. Under part II of the 870LT, taxpayers\nwaive the restriction provided by sections 6225(a) and 6213(a) and consent to\nthe assessment and collection of any deficiency attributable to partner level\ndeterminations. Form 870LT part II further provides that if this part of the 870LT\nis signed, the treatment of the affected items and penalties and additions to tax\nattributable to the settled items will not be reopened in the absence of fraud,\nmalfeasance or misrepresentation of fact. However, part II did not list the\naffected items covered by the agreement, any penalties, or any calculations as to\nhow part I applied to Taxpayer\u2019s individual return. Part II contained the preprinted boiler plate and nothing else. A Schedule of Adjustments was attached to\nthe Form 870LT but it only contained adjustments to the partnership return (i.e.\nitems related to part I). The 870LT agreement in this case was countersigned and forwarded to the\nService center. As Taxpayer did not file a return for Year 1, a substitute for\nreturn was prepared for her. Pursuant to the processing of the 870LT, Taxpayer\nhas been assessed the failure to file and failure to pay penalties under section\n6651 as well as the failure to pay estimated income tax penalty under section\n6654. Taxpayer, through her attorney, Attorney, now argues that she is entitled to\nAppeals rights for the section 751 issue as well as the penalties. Taxpayer\nargues that the section 751 adjustment is subject to section 453 installment\nreporting and that she could not have raised this \"defense\" to the adjustment at\nthe partnership level.",

Taxpayer\nargues that the section 751 adjustment is subject to section 453 installment\nreporting and that she could not have raised this \"defense\" to the adjustment at\nthe partnership level. In a letter dated May 14, 2012, Attorney takes issue with the Service on three\nfronts:\n(1) Form 870LT was obtained by misrepresentation of facts and hence should be\ndisregarded;\n(2) The Service should follow its own procedures as set forth in Chief Counsel\nNotice 2009-011. (3) The assessment is not based on items contained in the partnership\nagreement but requires further determination at the partner lever. 1 Part I of the Form 870LT is entitled \u201cAgreement for partnership items and partnership\nlevel determinations as to penalties, additions to Tax and additional amounts and\nagreement for affected items\u201d. 2\nPart II of the Form 870LT is entitled \u201cOffer of agreement for affected items and\nwaiver of restrictions on assessment.\u201d POSTF-118310-12 3 Although she did not list it as an item, Taxpayer also protests that the penalties in\nthis case have been assessed and argues she was denied her rights under\nnormal deficiency procedures to address the penalties. 1. The 870LT Was Not Obtained by Misrepresentation\nA Form 870LT is a settlement agreement between the Secretary and one or\nmore partners in a partnership with respect to the determination of partnerships\nitems for any partnership taxable year. Such agreements, often referred to as\n\u201cclosing agreements\u201d, are governed under sections 6224(c) and 7121. \u201cThe\nstandard that section 6224(c) prescribes for setting aside a settlement agreement\nis the same standard prescribed by section 7121(b) for setting aside a closing\nagreement.\u201d H Graphics/Access Ltd. Partnership v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo.\n1992-345. Specifically, an agreement will not be rescinded in the absence of\nfraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of fact. Taxpayer alleges that the 870LT herein was secured by the agent\u2019s\nmisrepresentation of facts. \u201cMisrepresentation of facts\u201d is not defined in the\nInternal Revenue Code, but a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d is defined as \u201ca false\nstatement of a substantive fact, or any conduct which leads to a belief of a\nsubstantive fact material to proper understanding of the matter in hand, made\nwith intent to deceive or mislead.\u201d Black's Law Dictionary 956, 1001 (6th ed.\n1990); see Brinkman v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1989-217. A\nmisrepresentation sufficient to set aside a closing agreement pursuant to section\n7121(b) requires a showing that one party intentionally made incorrect or\nmisleading representations regarding the express terms reflected in the proposed\nclosing agreement and that such representations were relied upon by the other\nparty to its detriment. Bennett v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1988-557. Taxpayer argues the 870LT was obtained by a misrepresentation of facts\nbecause Attorney was \u201cnot advised that the taxpayer was waiving her rights as a\npartner.\u201d By her own statement, the agent did not make any incorrect or\nmisleading representations related to the terms or effect of the proposed 870LT. While Taxpayer alleges misrepresentation and deception by the agent, she\nprovides nothing in support of these allegations except the mere assertion that\nthe agent never advised her of the consequences of signing the agreement.",

      "content": "While Taxpayer alleges misrepresentation and deception by the agent, she\nprovides nothing in support of these allegations except the mere assertion that\nthe agent never advised her of the consequences of signing the agreement. However, Attorney stated during a Date 2 call that he had not fully read the\nagreement previously. Attorney never raised any questions with the agent about\nthe effect or operation of the agreement. He never indicated he did not\nunderstand the 870LT package given to him. He had no discussions with the\nagent about the agreement. What we have here is a unilateral mistake and not\nmisrepresentation on the part of the Service. Section 7121 does not provide an\nexclusion for mistake or error of a party or representative and circumstances of\nerror, mistake of fact, or negligence will not be sufficient to set aside a closing\nagreement. Brinkman, T.C. Memo 1989-217. Therefore, the Form 870LT was\nnot obtained by misrepresentation and is valid. POSTF-118310-12 4 2. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Part II of the 870LT is entitled \u201cOffer of Agreement for Affected items\nand Waiver of Restriction on Assessment.\u201d The \u201cInstructions for Signing Form\n870LT\u201d (870LT instructions) provides:\nSign Part II (Offer of Settlement of Affected Items and\nWaiver of Restrictions on Assessment) of Form 870LT to\nsettle the items that require partner level determinations\n(affected items, including penalties, additions to tax, and\nadditional amounts, if any). These items are also shown on the attached Schedule of\nAdjustments. The agent provided the Form 870LT package to Attorney when he proposed the\nadjustment. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3. Chief Counsel Notice 2009-11 Does Not Apply to this Case\nTaxpayer urges the government to follow its own guidance, specifically Chief\nCounsel Notice 2009-11. Notice 2009-11 provides for protective assessments of\naffected items in TEFRA partnership cases. The notice recognizes that hazards\nexist in cases where there could be a question as to whether an item may be\ndirectly assessed following the partnership proceeding or whether an additional\npartner-level determination is needed. Notice 2009-11 applies in cases where a\npartner has reported a loss (or reduced gain) on the partner\u2019s individual return POSTF-118310-12 5 after having sold an interest in a TEFRA partnership or an asset distributed from\na TEFRA partnership. Due to the uncertainty that can occur in classifying an\nitem as one that can be directly assessed versus one that requires an additional\npartner-level determination, and considering the hazards inherent in\nmisclassifying an item, the notice advises the Service to make a protective\nassessment in addition to issuing an affected items notice of deficiency. A portion of Notice 2009-11 states that deficiency procedures are generally\nnecessary to determine loss or gain on the sale of a partnership interest given\nthat outside basis in the partnership, necessary to compute loss or gain, requires\na partner-level determination. See Petaluma FX Partners, LLC v. Comm\u2019r, 591\nF.3d 649, 654-55 (D.C. Cir. 2010). But see Thompson v. Commisioner, 137 T.C.\nNo. 17 (2012). We agree that deficiency procedures would be required, but,\nTaxpayer waived deficiency procedures in part II of the Form 870LT, at least as\nto the agreed items.",

We agree that deficiency procedures would be required, but,\nTaxpayer waived deficiency procedures in part II of the Form 870LT, at least as\nto the agreed items. 4. The Section 751 Adjustment is Not Subject to Section 453 Treatment\nTaxpayer takes the position that the \u201ccorrect computational adjustment\u201d is that\nthe sale of the inventory should be reported using the installment method. However, the section 751 adjustment would not be subject to section 453\ntreatment. Section 453(b) defines installment sales. Section 453(b)(2)(B)\nprovides \u201cinstallment sale\u201d does not include:\nInventories of personal property. A disposition of personal\nproperty of a kind which is required to be included in the\ninventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the\ntaxable year. Further, Rev. Rul. 89-108 holds that under section 453, the income from the sale\nof a partnership interest may not be reported under the installment method to the\nextent it represents income attributable to the partnership\u2019s substantially\nappreciated inventory which would not be eligible for the installment sale\ntreatment if sold directly. The ruling further states that \u201cthe installment method is\nnot available for reporting income realized on the sale of a partnership interest to\nthe extent attributable to the substantially appreciated inventory which constitutes\ninventory within the meaning of section 453(b)(2)(B).\u201d3 As such, the section 751\nadjustment is not eligible for section 453 treatment. However, the remaining\ncapital gain portion of Taxpayer\u2019s gain from the sale of the partnership interest\nmay be subject to section 453 treatment. 3 As a result of the amendments to sections 751(a)(2) and 751(d) by \u00a7 1062 of the\nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the conclusion that in Rev. Rul. 89-108 that installment\nmethod reporting is not available, currently applies to income realized on the sale of a\npartnership interest on inventory items of the partnership as defined in section 751(d). The restriction to inventory items of the partnership that have \u201cappreciated\nsubstantially in value\u201d has been eliminated. This amendment to section 751 applies\ngenerally to sales, exchanges and distributions after August 5, 1997. POSTF-118310-12 6 5. Taxpayer Should Be Given Appeals Rights As to the Penalties\nTaxpayer argues that the penalties in this case were improperly assessed. She\nargues that the penalties relate to her individual return and the issues were not\ndiscussed at the partnership level. Rather, she posits the penalties are subject to\ndeficiency procedures and the direct assessment of the penalties in this case\ndeprived her of her rights under normal deficiency procedures. The penalties at\nissue are penalties under sections 6651 and 6654. Under section 6665, penalties under sections 6651 and 6654 are normally not\nsubject to deficiency procedures unless they are attributable to deficiencies\nwhich are subject to deficiency procedures. However, there is an exception for\nsection 6654 penalties in cases where no return was filed. I.R.C. \u00a7 6665(b)(2). In instances where no return is filed, section 6654 penalties are treated as taxes\nand are subject to deficiency procedures.",
