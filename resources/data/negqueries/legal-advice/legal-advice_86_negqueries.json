Facts:\nIn Month 1, Year 1, -------- (\u201cTaxpayer\u201d) approved a development project in City, State\nwhich was to include active adult homes in a golf course community (\u201cCommunity\nProject\u201d). The project originally included N1 active homes, but in early Year 2, due to\nthe pressures of a market downturn, the Community Project was renegotiated and\nrestructured. On Date 1, Taxpayer entered into two agreements with Inc. 1., Inc. 2, and\nPrincipal (collectively, \u201cSeller\u201d): (1) a purchase agreement (Year 2 Purchase\nAgreement) to buy N2 finished lots on N3 acres in City, State from Seller and (2) an\nAmenity Center Contract for the construction of a N4 sq. ft. center with amenities for the\nproperty. In addition, Taxpayer entered into a third agreement with the Seller: an oral\nagreement under which Taxpayer would construct the amenity center and the Seller\nwould reimburse Taxpayer the costs. Principal personally guaranteed the obligations\nunder each of the agreements. In total, the three agreements (collectively \u201cYear 2\nAgreements\u201d) called for Taxpayer to deposit approximately $Amount 1.1 Under the\nterms of the Year 2 Purchase Agreement, Taxpayer was required to pay $Amount 2 per\nlot delivered by Seller. The total deposit of $Amount 3 was to be applied to the\npurchase of the developed lots as the Seller completed development of the lots. The\ndeposit was applied toward the purchase of each lot at the rate of $Amount 4 per lot. Of\nthe $Amount 3 deposit, $Amount 5 remained after delivery of N5 developed lots by\nSeller in Year 2 and Year 3. Whether the taxpayer is entitled to an abandonment loss\nfor this remaining amount of the deposit is the subject of this memo. Principal died unexpectedly in Month 2, Year 2. Construction of the Community Project\n(including the amenity center) ceased in mid-Year 3. According to Taxpayer, Principal\u2019s\ndeath led to a ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Year 2 ------------------------------. In a letter dated Date 2\nfrom Taxpayer\u2019s Attorney to the Seller, Taxpayer alleges that \u201c--------------------------------------------------------- -Year 2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.\u201d Following this letter, in Month 3, Year 3, Taxpayer sued Seller for failure to fulfill\nits contractual obligations. At the time Taxpayer filed suit, Taxpayer had acquired N5\ndeveloped lots from the Seller at a cost of $Amount 6 (N5 lots at $Amount 4per lot).",

At the time Taxpayer filed suit, Taxpayer had acquired N5\ndeveloped lots from the Seller at a cost of $Amount 6 (N5 lots at $Amount 4per lot).

United Dairy\nFarmers, Inc. v. U.S., 267 F.3d 510, 522 (6th Cir. 2001). To establish the\nabandonment of an asset for purposes of section 165, a taxpayer must show both\n(1) an intention to abandon the asset, and (2) an affirmative act of abandonment. CRST, Inc. v. Commissioner, 92 T.C. 1249, 1257 (1989), aff'd, 909 F.2d 1146 (8th\nCir. 1990); A.J. Industries, Inc. v. United States, 503 F.2d 660, 670 (9th Cir. 1974);\nRev. Rul. 93-80, 1993-2 C.B. 239. An affirmative act of abandonment must be\nascertained from all the facts and surrounding circumstances. Burke v.\nCommissioner, 32 T.C. 775, 780 (1959), aff\u2019d, 283 F.2d 487 (9th Cir. 1960). Taxpayer argues that it abandoned the Community Project. Taxpayer states, \u201c------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.\u201d12\nTaxpayer determined that \u201ccertain components\u201d of the Community Project\nincluding the Deposit, had been rendered \u201cwithout value.\u201d Taxpayer argues the\ncompany\u2019s determination that the Deposit had \u201cno value\u201d and its decision in Date\n6 to write the amount off is an identifiable event leading to abandonment. However, in Corra Resources v. Commissioner, 945 F.2d 224, 226 (7th Cir. 1991),\nthe Seventh Circuit observed that, \u201c[i]ntra-corporate affairs . . . do not generate\nsigns visible to outside observers and therefore do not mark the crossing of the\n12 Page 4, Taxpayer Memo to Exam, Date 3. 9\nRubicon.\u201d Id. at 226. Thus, the intra-company communications of Taxpayer,\nbetween its management and/or Division and even its communication to its\naccounting department to write off the project \u201cdo not generate signs visible to\noutside observers\u201d and therefore do not constitute an \u201cidentifiable event\u201d to\nestablish an abandonment. Taxpayer asserted that it informed Seller of its intention to \u201cwalk away\u201d from the\nproject. 13 Taxpayer may further argue that it acted to abandon the Community\nProject in Month 6 Year 4, when it terminated its selling efforts of the\ndevelopment, closed the sales center, and ceased construction of the amenity\ncenter. While these facts may be relevant to consider, an intent to abandon and\nan affirmative act of abandonment must be ascertained by examining all the facts\nand surrounding circumstances. As discussed below, there are several acts and events that occurred in Year 4\nthat, together, show that Taxpayer did not irrevocably cut ties with the Community\nProject and did not intend to abandon the Community Project. A. The Year 2 Agreements and the Year 4 Agreement are Part of the Process\nof Acquisition of the Community Project. Section 165 requires that substance, not form, govern in determining a deductible\nloss. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.165-1(b). Mere changes in the terms of a transaction do not\nconstitute abandonment. An otherwise abandoned expenditure, if part of an\nintegrated plan that is implemented, is not an abandonment loss under section\n165. Nicolazzi v. Commissioner, 79 T.C. 109, 132 (1982), aff\u2019d, 722 F.2d 324 (6th\nCir. 1983). Furthermore, if potential transactions are alternatives, only one of\nwhich can be completed, no abandonment loss is proper unless the taxpayer\nabandons the entire transaction.",

In FRGC Investment, LLC v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2002-276, aff\u2019d, 89 F.\nA\u2019ppx. 656 (9th Cir. 2004), the Tax Court denied a 1997 tax year abandonment\nloss where the circumstances surrounding the taxpayer\u2019s project showed that\nrenegotiation and obstacles over several years were merely steps in continuing\nand successful attempts to acquire the property. In 1995, the taxpayer entered\ninto a real estate contract to purchase 240 acres for development from an entity\nowned by an individual. After objections to surveys and other title reports, the\nescrow for the contract was cancelled. In 1996, the taxpayer entered into a\nsecond real estate contract with the same entity to purchase 404 acres of the\n13 Taxpayer mentions in its Date 3, Memo to Exam that it communicated its decision to walk away from\nthe project. Taxpayer, however, has not provided any facts to support it informed Seller. 10\nsame land for development. Approval for zoning the development became\nunlikely so in 1997, the taxpayer and the entity executed mutual cancellations of\nthe contract to release the escrow. In 1998, the taxpayer and the individual\nowning the entity that was a party to the first two contracts decided to execute a\nthird contract. The contract was fulfilled and the escrow closed that same year,\nresulting in taxpayer owning the land that it sought to develop. The taxpayer\nclaimed a section 165 loss for expenses incurred in 1997, and argued that the\n1997 contract had been abandoned due to the cancelled escrows. The tax court\ndisagreed and found that the taxpayer's claims that the 1998 contract was\ndifferent from the purportedly abandoned 1997 contract were rebutted by the fact\nthat the taxpayer moved forward to purchase the same real estate for the same\npurpose, although there had been changes in the terms of the agreement. The\ncourt viewed the earlier 1995 and 1996 purchase agreements as steps in the\ntaxpayer\u2019s continuing efforts to acquire the property. Additionally, the taxpayer\nentered into a new purchase agreement with the counter-party only two weeks\nafter the cancellation of the 1996 purchase agreement. The court held the\ntaxpayer\u2019s execution of a new purchase agreement in January 1998 to be\ninconsistent with the taxpayer\u2019s contention that the project was abandoned in\n1997. The court further found that in substance, the first agreement was merely a\nstep in the partnership\u2019s continuing and successful attempts to acquire the\nproperty. In the present case, Taxpayer continued its effort to acquire the Community\nProject through Year 4, as evidenced by the Year 2 Agreements and Year 4\nAgreement. These agreements, along with the pursuit of legal remedies and\ncontinued negotiations, were all steps in the process to acquire the Community\nProject.",

      "content": "In the present case, Taxpayer continued its effort to acquire the Community\nProject through Year 4, as evidenced by the Year 2 Agreements and Year 4\nAgreement. These agreements, along with the pursuit of legal remedies and\ncontinued negotiations, were all steps in the process to acquire the Community\nProject. Taxpayer views the Year 4 Agreement as separate and distinct from the\nYear 2 Agreement, the related litigation and the Settlement Agreement. A review\nof Taxpayer\u2019s own records, however, demonstrates that it treated all these\ntransactions and the litigation as intertwined with the ultimate goal of acquiring and\ndeveloping the Community project: 1. The Date 6 Memo from Taxpayer\u2019s management to the Management\nCommittee discusses the Taxpayer\u2019s investments with regard to the Year 2\nAgreements and references the deposits under the agreements. The Date 6\nMemo goes on to state that -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Taxpayer states that settlement of the Year 2\nAgreements and its related litigation will be \u201c-------------------------------------------------------------------.\u201d The principal terms of the anticipated settlement are\nembodied in the Year 4 Agreement. 2. The Year 4 Agreement is prefaced with statements which refer to\nTaxpayer\u2019s desire to purchase property subject to certain terms and\nconditions and goes on to state that the parties desire to \u201c------------------------- 11\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.\u201d The language within the Year 4 Agreement supports the\nview that the Year 4 Agreement was designed to settle the legal disputes\nbetween the parties arising out of the Year 2 Agreements in the form of a\nrenegotiated purchase agreement for the Community Project. 3. In the Month 4 Year 5 President\u2019s Overview, which described events of\nYear 4 and prior years, Taxpayer requested approval of the --------------------------------as laid out under the terms of the Year 4 Agreement. The Year 4\nagreement is referenced in the Settlement Agreement. In the Overview,\nTaxpayer again discusses the project from its inception, beginning in Year\n1, and describes the Year 2 and Year 4 Agreements. The Overview\nconcludes that a -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u201c------------------------------------------------------------------------------.\u201d Furthermore,\nthe --------------------------did not require a deposit as the Taxpayer previously\npaid Seller a $Amount 19 deposit on the original contract with Seller. In\naddition, the Overview specified that if the Seller defaulted on the Year 4\nAgreement, the litigation between Taxpayer and Seller would resume since\nthe Year 4 Agreement was considered by the parties as the form of the\nsettlement. Accordingly, the Year 4 Agreement and the Settlement\nAgreement were dependent on one another. Taxpayer saw the series of\ntransactions as part of the overall strategy related to the acquisition of the\nCommunity Project. 4. The Settlement Agreement incorporates by reference the series of\ntransactions and agreements, including the Year 2 Agreements, the Year 4\nAgreement, as well as the litigation, and notes that each item is a material\nfact underlying the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement\nfurther provides that it and the Year 4 Agreement supersede and cancel\nany and all prior agreements, negotiations, arrangements and\nunderstandings between Seller and Taxpayer. In addition, the fact that Taxpayer continued to service the existing homes already\nsold at the Community Project is further evidence that Taxpayer did not intend to\nabandon the Community Project.",

      "content": "In addition, the fact that Taxpayer continued to service the existing homes already\nsold at the Community Project is further evidence that Taxpayer did not intend to\nabandon the Community Project. This is consistent with the language in section\n19 of the Year 4 Agreement that mentions Taxpayer\u2019s sales of homes to\ncustomers in the Community Project and that \u201c--------------------------------------------------------------------\u201d as part of the Taxpayer\u2019s development. These facts collectively show that in substance, Taxpayer\u2019s business purpose was\nto acquire the Community Project in State. The Year 2 Agreements and the\nnegotiations that led to the Year 4 Agreement were steps in Taxpayer\u2019s continued\nefforts to acquire the Community Project. These integrated steps to acquire the\nCommunity Project do not support a claim of abandonment. 12 B. The Ongoing Litigation For a loss to be sustained under section 165, a loss must be evidenced by closed\nand completed transactions. United States v. S.S. White Dental Manufacturing\nCo., 274 U.S. 398, 401 (1927); Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.165-1(b). Thus, if there exists a\nclaim for reimbursement with respect to which there is a reasonable prospect of\nrecovery, the loss is not deductible until it can be ascertained with reasonable\ncertainty whether such reimbursement will be received. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1651(d)(2)(i); Ramsey Scarlett & Co. v. Commissioner, 61 T.C. 795, 806-807 (1974),\naff\u2019d, 521 F.2d 786 (4th Cir. 1975); Estate of Scofield v. Commissioner, 266 F.2d\n154, 159 (6th Cir. 1959), aff\u2019g and rev\u2019g. in part 25 T.C. 774 (1956). Whether a\nreasonable prospect of recovery exists is to be determined by all of the facts and\ncircumstances. In determining whether a taxpayer had a reasonable prospect of\nrecovery, the fact that the taxpayer filed a lawsuit to recover the loss gives rise to\nan inference that the taxpayer has such prospect. Dawn v. Commissioner, 675\nF.2d 1077, 1078 (9th Cir. 1982). See also Estate of Scofield, 266 F.2d at 159. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.165-1(d)(2)(i) requires that a taxpayer ascertain with \u201creasonable\ncertainty\u201d whether it will receive reimbursement for the loss before deducting a\nloss under section 165. The examples provided in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.165-1(d)(2)(i)\ninvolve some type of resolution of a claim for reimbursement, for example, a\nsettlement, adjudication, or abandonment of a claim. In addition, before a\ntaxpayer takes a loss, the regulation requires that the taxpayer produce objective\nevidence of abandonment of the claim, such as the execution of a release. Taxpayer has not shown that in Year 4 it did not have a reasonable prospect of\nrecovery or that it abandoned its claims against Seller in the litigation. Taxpayer\ncontinued to pursue litigation against Seller through Year 4 to enforce its rights\nrelated to the Community Project, including engaging in settlement negotiations\nwith the Seller to attempt to resolve the litigation. The taxpayer\u2019s continuance of\nthe litigation in Year 4 is inconsistent with an intent to abandon the project in that\nyear. The recovery process was not finalized until the Settlement Agreement was\nexecuted on Date 8, which resulted in the dismissal of the litigation.",

The recovery process was not finalized until the Settlement Agreement was\nexecuted on Date 8, which resulted in the dismissal of the litigation. In addition,\nunder the terms of the Year 4 Agreement, Taxpayer agreed to relinquish its claim\nto the deposit pending the closing of the Year 4 Agreement which occurred on\nDate 8. Thus, there was no closed and completed transaction in Year 4. Conclusion: To be allowable as a deduction under section 165, a loss must be evidenced by a\nclosed and completed transaction, and fixed by an identifiable event. In this case,\nexamining all the facts and circumstances, Taxpayer did not sustain an\nabandonment loss in Year 4. The facts and circumstances, including ongoing\nlitigation, the settlement negotiations, and the executed purchase agreement in 13\nOctober of Year 4 collectively show that Taxpayer did not sustain an\nabandonment loss in Year 4.
