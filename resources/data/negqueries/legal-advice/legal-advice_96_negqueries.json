Does a provision in an Operating Agreement that restricts a Managing Member\n(Company B) from settling claims against Company A over a certain amount\nwithout the consent of certain additional members prevent the Managing Member\nfrom executing a Form 870-LT on behalf of Company A with respect to\npartnership adjustments to ABC Partnership? 2. Does a restriction in an Operating Agreement on the ability of the Company B to\nbind other members to tax settlement agreements without their written consent\nprevent Company B from executing a Form 870-LT on behalf of Company A with\nrespect to partnership adjustments to ABC Partnership? 3. Does a restriction in an Operating Agreement on the ability of Company C to bind\nother members to tax settlement agreements without their written consent\nprevent Company C from executing a Form 870-LT in its capacity as Managing\nMember of Company B, as Managing Member of Company A, with respect to\npartnership adjustments to ABC Partnership? 4. What title should be used for the signature on the Form 870-LT? 5. Will Company A\u2019s execution of the Form 870-LT bind its indirect partners to the\npartnership items provided in the 870-LT? CONCLUSIONS 1. No. To the extent this restriction is applicable, it is met as Company B owns\n100% of Company A; thus, there are no additional members to consent. 2. No. The restriction relates to Company B\u2019s ability to act as the TMP of Company\nA, not Company B\u2019s management authority. Company B is not acting as the\nTMP of Company A. Rather, Company B is acting in its capacity as the\nManaging Member of Company A. Therefore, the restriction does not apply. 3. No. The restriction relates to Company C\u2019s ability to act as the TMP of Company\nA, not Company B\u2019s management authority. Company B is not acting as the\nTMP of Company A. Rather, Company B is acting in its capacity as the\nManaging Member of Company A. Therefore, the restriction does not apply. 4. The signature line for the Form 870-LT should read: Company A, by Company B,\nManaging Member, by Company C, Managing Member, by Individual D,\nManaging Member. 5. Company A\u2019s execution of the Form 870-LT will bind its indirect partners\nprovided that such partners have not been identified as provided in section\n6223(c)(3). POSTF-112225-10 3",

To eliminate the administrative burden caused by duplicative audits and litigation and to\nprovide consistent treatment of partnership items among the partners in the same\npartnership, Congress enacted the unified audit and litigation procedures of the Tax\nEquity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (\u201cTEFRA\u201d).

In some circumstances,\nthe TMP and a pass-thru partner can also bind other partners. If a pass-thru partner enters into a settlement agreement with the IRS with respect to\npartnership items, he binds all indirect partners having an interest in the partnership\nthrough the pass-thru partner, unless the IRS has been notified of the indirect partner's\nname, address and beneficial interest in the partnership in accordance with I.R.C. \u00a7\n6223(c)(3) and Treas.

      "content": "Id. at 211. In General\nAs Company A is a partner of ABC Partnership, the IRS may enter into a settlement\nagreement with Company A with respect to the partnership items of ABC Partnership. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6224(c). The fact Company A became a disregarded entity in Year 1 does\nnot change this, as disregarded entities are still partners. See Rev. Rul. 2004-88. Because Company A is a limited liability company, its manager under State law must\nsign on its behalf, regardless of whether the LLC is subject to the TEFRA partnership\nprocedures. See IRS CCN CC-2009-027, Q&A (F)3; cf. Rev. Rul. 2004-88. Therefore,\nCompany B may sign the Form 870-LT on behalf of Company A provided Company B\nhas authority under state law. In this case, Company A\u2019s Operating Agreement\nprovides that Company B is the Managing Member of Company A and no other member\nhas management authority. Therefore, Company B is the manager of Company A\nunder State law. See DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 6, \u00a7 18-402. However, there are several provisions in Company A\u2019s Operating Agreement that must\nbe analyzed to make sure Company B has the necessary authority. Issue 1 The adjustments to ABC Partnership for most of the Years at Issue exceed $X. Article\nM, Section B of Company A\u2019s Operating Agreement provides that the Managing\n5 I.R.C. \u00a7 6229(b)(1) provides that provides the statute of limitations may be extended \u201cwith respect to all\npartners, by an agreement entered into by the Secretary and the tax matters partner (or any other person\nauthorized by the partnership in writing to enter into such an agreement), before the expiration of such\nperiod.\u201d In the Medical & Business Facilities, Ltd. case, the general partner who signed the statute\nextension was not the TMP and the government attempted to rely on the \u201cor any other person authorized\nby the partnership in writing\u201d provision to validate the statute extension. POSTF-112225-10 9 Member cannot settle claims against Company A over $X without the written consent of\nmembers holding at least X% of the voting power. While we view the partnership\nadjustments as claims (to the extent the assertion of adjustments, rather than actual\namounts due, constitutes a claim) against the partners of ABC Partnership rather than\nclaims against Company A, this provision, if applicable, is met as Company B owns\n100% of Company A. Thus, there are no additional members to consent. Issue 2\nArticle N, Section C of Company A\u2019s Operating Agreement places restrictions on\nCompany B\u2019s ability to bind other members to settlement agreements without their\nwritten consent. Neither Article N nor Section C relates to the management of\nCompany A or who has authority to bind Company A. Rather, Article N address\nmiscellaneous matters and Section C specifically addresses the Managing Member\u2019s\nauthority to act as the TMP. TEFRA created a single partnership-level proceeding for audits of partnership items. See Pub. L. 97-248, \u00a7 401, 96 Stat. 648; I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6221-34; Meruelo, 132 T.C. at 362;\nH. Conf.

The TMP is the\nliaison between the partnership and the IRS in such administrative proceeding. See\nI.R.C. \u00a7 6231(a)(7); Bush, 101 Fed. Cl. at 793; Conway, 50 Fed. Cl. at 276. Thus, Company B, as the TMP of Company A, will act as the liaison between Company\nA and the IRS if there is an audit of Company A for a year when it was a TEFRA\npartnership. 6 This case involves a TEFRA audit of ABC Partnership, not Company A.\nTherefore, Company B is not acting as the TMP of Company A. Rather, Company B is\nacting in its capacity as the Managing Member of Company A. See IRS CCN CC-2009027, Q&A (F)3 (\u201ca manager of the LLC, under State law, must sign, regardless of\nwhether the LLC is subject to the TEFRA partnership procedures\u201d); cf. Rev. Rul. 200488 (indicating that State law governs who has authority to act on behalf of a limited\nliability company). As discussed above, Company B is the manager of Company A under State law. Article M of Company A\u2019s Operating Agreement addresses the management of\nCompany A. Article M, Section A places management and control in Company B and\ngives Company B the authority to bind Company A. The only exceptions to this\nmanagement authority are listed in Article M, Section B. The exceptions in Section B\nare inapplicable and/or are met as discussed under Issue 1. The tax matters provision\nat issue is not contained within Article M, Section B and, thus, does not constitute a\nlimitation on Company B\u2019s management authority. Moreover, Section A expressly provides that Company B, as Managing Member, has\n\u201cthe overall responsibility for the management, operation, and administration of the\n6 As Company A is now a disregarded entity, it is no longer a TEFRA partnership. POSTF-112225-10 10 Company, including all actions to be taken by the Company as a member of [ABC\nPartnership].\u201d As the execution of the Forms 870-LT is an action to be taken by\nCompany A as a member of ABC Partnership, such action falls within the scope of\nCompany B\u2019s express management authority. The facts of this case are distinguishable from Medical & Business Facilities, Ltd., as\nthe restrictions at issue in that case pertained to the management of the company,\nwhereas the restrictions at issue here pertain to Company B\u2019s ability to act as TMP for\nthe members of Company A. Therefore, Company B may sign the Form 870-LT on behalf of Company A as\nCompany B has the necessary management authority under State law to do so. See\nDEL. CODE ANN. tit. 6, \u00a7 18-402. The correctness of this conclusion is illustrated by the application of the restriction were\nit to apply. Application of the restriction would require the consent of individuals and/or\nentities that (1) have no management authority and (2) are no longer members. This\nwould be contrary to DEL.

Application of the restriction would require the consent of individuals and/or\nentities that (1) have no management authority and (2) are no longer members. This\nwould be contrary to DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 6, \u00a7 18-402 regarding who has authority to act\non behalf of a limited liability company, and would override I.R.C. \u00a7 6224(c)(1),7 which\nprovides that a settlement agreement that is entered into by a pass-thru partner binds\nall indirect partners. Issue 3 A similar issue exists with respect to who may sign on behalf of Company B. Because\nCompany B is a limited liability company, its manager under State law must sign on its\nbehalf, regardless of whether the LLC is subject to the TEFRA partnership procedures. See IRS CCN CC-2009-027, Q&A (F)3; cf. Rev. Rul. 2004-88. Therefore, Company C\nmay sign the Form 870-LT on behalf of Company B provided Company C has authority\nunder state law. In this case, Company B\u2019s Operating Agreement provides that\nCompany C is the Managing Member of Company B and no other member has\nmanagement authority. Therefore, Company C is the manager of Company B under\nState law. See DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 6, \u00a7 18-402. However, there is a provision in Article P, Section E of Company B\u2019s operating\nAgreement that restricts the ability of Company C to bind other members to settlement\nagreements without their written consent. This provision is virtually identical to the tax\nmatters provision in Company A\u2019s Operating Agreement discussed in Issue 2 above. Neither Article P nor Section E relates to the management of Company B or who has\nauthority to bind Company B. Rather, Article P address miscellaneous matters and\nSection E specifically addresses the Managing Member\u2019s authority to act as the TMP. As discussed above, Company C is the manager of Company B under State law. 7 In effect, a broad interpretation of the provision at issue would require the IRS to obtain settlement\nagreements from all indirect partners even though such partners were not identified in accordance with\nI.R.C. \u00a7 6223(c)(3) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6223(c)-1. POSTF-112225-10 11 Article O of Company B\u2019s Operating Agreement addresses the management of\nCompany B. Article O, Section D gives Company C sole management authority with no\nexceptions. Therefore, for the same reasons discussed in Issue 2, this provision does\nnot prevent Company C from signing the Form 870-LT on behalf of Company B, on\nbehalf of Company A.\nIssue 4 As discussed above, Company B is the manager of Company A and has authority to\nsign on its behalf, and Company C is the manager of Company B and has authority to\nsign on its behalf. Company C is also a limited liability company. Its Operating\nAgreement designates Individual D as its Managing Member and there are no\nrestrictions on Individual D\u2019s management authority. Thus, Individual D is the manager\nof Company C and has authority to sign on its behalf. See IRS CCN CC-2009-027,\nQ&A (F)3; DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 6, \u00a7 18-402; cf. Rev. Rul. 2004-88.",

Issue 5 The IRS may enter into a settlement agreement with Company A, as a partner of ABC\nPartnership, with respect to partnership items. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6224(c). As a limited\nliability company that is a disregarded entity for federal tax purposes, Company A is a\npass-thru partner. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6213(a)(9); Rev. Rul. 2004-88. Because Company A is\na pass-thru partner, if it enters into a settlement agreement with the IRS with respect to\npartnership items, it binds all indirect partners having an interest in the partnership\nthrough Company A, unless the IRS has been notified of the indirect partner's name,\naddress and beneficial interest in the partnership in accordance with I.R.C. \u00a7 6223(c)(3)\nand Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6223(c)-1, at least 30 days before the settlement agreement is\nentered into with Company A. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6224(c)(1); Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6224(c)2(a)(1). To our knowledge, no indirect partners have been identified in accordance with I.R.C. \u00a7\n6223(c)(3) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6223(c)-1. Any indirect partners that are identified in\naccordance with these provisions should be sent a separate Form 870-LT. CASE DEVELOPMENT, HAZARDS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Affected Items POSTF-112225-10 12 We note that Form 870-LT is being used, which form permits the partner to agree to\nboth partnership adjustments and affected items or only partnership adjustments. I.R.C. \u00a7 6231(b)(1)(C) provides that the settlement of partnership items converts the\npartnership items to nonpartnership items. Deficiency procedures do not apply to settled partnership items. See I.R.C. \u00a7\n6230(a)(2)(A)(ii). Instead, the Service computes the change in tax liability and directly\nassesses this amount. This is known as a \u201ccomputational adjustment.\u201d See I.R.C. \u00a7\n6231(a)(6). Section 6231(a)(6) provides that \u201c[a]ll adjustments required to apply the\nresults of a proceeding with respect to a partnership under this subchapter to an indirect\npartner shall be treated as computational adjustments.\u201d However, I.R.C. \u00a7 6230(a)(2)(A)(i) provides that deficiency proceedings apply to\naffected items which require partner level determinations. Therefore, while a pass-thru partner may bind indirect partners to a settlement\nagreement as to a partnership item, see I.R.C. \u00a7 6224(c)(1), the pass-thru partner may\nnot bind indirect partners to a settlement agreement as to affected items. To the extent\naffected items are involved, the indirect partners themselves would have to agree to\nsuch items or deficiency procedures must be initiated. Thus, Company A cannot sign\nPart II of Form 870-LT.
