On its original ------- Form 1120-SF, the Trust reported capital gain from\nthe sale of securities. On its ------- Form 1120-SF, the Trust treated losses from the sale\nof securities as ordinary losses and included them in the calculation of its net operating\nloss (NOL). The Trust subsequently amended its ------- Form 1120-SF and\nrecharacterized as ordinary income the amount originally reported as capital gain\nincome. The Trust also claimed a NOL carryback from the taxable year ended -------------------------------------- on its amended ------- Form 1120-SF. This advice has been\ncoordinated with the Associate Office of Chief Counsel, Income Tax & Accounting. This opinion is based on the facts set forth herein. It might change if the facts are\ndetermined to be incorrect. If the facts herein are determined to be incorrect, this\nopinion should not be relied upon. This memorandum should not be cited as precedent. Issues [Type text] 1. Whether the Trust may include ordinary losses from the sale of securities in the\ncalculation of its NOL on its ------- Form 1120-SF. 2. Whether the Trust correctly treated the sales of its securities on its ------- Form 1120SF and its amended ------- Form 1120-SF as producing ordinary losses/income instead\nof capital gains/losses. Conclusions\n1. Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.468B-2(b) does not permit a QSF to deduct any ordinary\nlosses nor does it permit ordinary losses to be included in a NOL of a QSF. Therefore,\nif the Trust treats the sales of its securities as sales producing ordinary losses, it should\nnot include those purported losses in the calculation of its NOL on its ------- Form 1120SF. 2. The Trust should have treated the sales of its securities on its ------- Form 1120-SF\nand its amended ------- Form 1120-SF as producing capital losses/gains instead of\nordinary losses/income. 1\nFacts We understand the relevant facts here to be as follows:\nThe ------------------------------------The Trust was established by order of the U.S. -------------------------------------------------------------------, as a result of a -------------------------------- submitted by ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.2 The Trust assumed the tort liabilities of --------------------------- relating to ------------------------------------------------------------ damage attributable to -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.

The Trust is an association taxable as a corporation since it carries on a business\nunder Rev. Rul. 58-442. The Trust further notes that a QSF is subject to I.R.C. \u00a7 468B\neven if a QSF is classified as an association for tax purposes. 2. When assets are held for sale in connection with a trade or business and the\nproceeds of such assets are less than the tax basis, there is negative gross income. The Trust cites I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 468B and 61(a)(1) in support of its position, as well as Davis v.\nUnited States, 87 F.2d 323 (2d Cir. 1937), cert. denied, 301 U.S. 704 (1937). [Type text] 3. Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.468B-2(b) provides that a QSF is allowed a NOL deduction\nto the extent the loss would be deductible in determining the taxable income of a\ncorporation under I.R.C. \u00a7 172(a). According to the Trust, that regulation is the only one\napplicable to trade or business losses of an entity taxable as a corporation (other than\nthe possibility that such losses are administrative costs described in Treas. Reg. \u00a7\n1.468B-2(b)(2)). 4. The Trust is entitled to the NOL described in I.R.C. \u00a7 172(b)(1)(A) unless the election\nunder \u00a7 172(b)(1)(H) is made. The Trust claims the amended return reflects such rules. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. The sale or exchange of Trust assets is not a sale or exchange of capital assets. The Trust notes that it is in the business of holding money and securities it is required to\nsell in the ordinary course of its trade or business each time a claimant must be paid. Due to the ----------------------------------------------------, the Trust incurred ---------------losses from the sale of assets ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Accordingly, the Trustees ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The sale of securities was motivated by the Trustees\u2019 determination\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Just as receipt\nof property is a necessary incident to the Trust\u2019s conduct of its business, so was the\ndecision -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. 2. The determination of the Trust\u2019s \u201cmodified gross income\u201d depends upon the\naggregate of the Trust\u2019s gross income items from all sources. Such determination of\nmodified gross income considers as one such item a negative amount resulting from the\nfailure to recover the tax basis of assets sold during the taxable year. According to the Trust, gross income is not the same as gross receipts. A fundamental\ntax principle in the calculation of gross income is the recovery of the tax basis of assets. Thus, the manner of the securities\u2019 losses are to be taken into account in calculating the\nTrust\u2019s modified gross income. \u201cGross income\u201d can be a negative figure when reduced\nby such necessary amounts as the tax basis of assets.",

To the extent the Trust has negative modified gross income, the negative modified\ngross income, as adjusted for allowed expenses, is a deductible NOL to the same\nextent as such loss would be allowable to a corporation under I.R.C. \u00a7 172(a). The Trust argues that \u00a7 172(a) allows corporate taxpayers a deduction for a taxable\nyear in the amount equal to the aggregate of NOL carryovers to such taxable year plus [Type text]\nNOL carrybacks to such taxable year. However, for noncorporate taxpayers, the\namount deductible for capital losses cannot exceed the amount includible as capital\ngains. The Trust contends that the provisions of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-2(b)(4)\nsupersede the definition of a NOL found in \u00a7 172(c). Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.468B2(b)(4) recognizes that incurring business-related losses can result in negative gross\nincome and merits amelioration of the annual accounting impact of such negative\namount provided by the NOL rules. For the Trust, the availability of a NOL to a QSF is\nconsistent with the NOL provisions and the regulations relating to the taxation of a QSF\nthat appear to be to maximize the amounts available to fund claimants.

In further support of those arguments, the Trust relied on Sears, Roebuck\n& Co. Employees\u2019 Savings and Profit Sharing Fund v. Commissioner, 45 F.2d 506 (7th\nCir. 1930). This submission also discussed the business of --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, and cites Brooklyn Trust Co. v.\nCommissioner, 80 F.2d 865 (2d Cir. 1936), Rev.

Third, \u00a7 1.468B-1(c)(3) provides that the trust must be a trust under\napplicable state law, or its assets must be otherwise segregated from other assets of\nthe transferor (and related persons). The facts here show the Trust meets the three requirements of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B1(c) and therefore is a QSF.

Administrative costs and other incidental expenses\ninclude state and local taxes, legal, accounting, and actuarial fees relating to the\noperation of the QSF, and expenses arising from the notification of claimants and the\nprocessing of their claims. Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.468B-2(b)(3) allows a deduction for losses sustained by a QSF\nfrom the sale, exchange, or worthlessness of property to the extent the losses would be\ndeductible in determining the taxable income of a corporation under I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 165(f) or\n(g), and under \u00a7\u00a7 1211(a) and 1212(a).

A NOL has\na longer carryforward period (20 years) than a capital loss carryforward (5 years). On\nthe Trust\u2019s amended ------- Form 1120-SF, it carried back part of the ------- NOL and\naccordingly increased its ------- NOL deduction. As discussed in the preceding section, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-2(b) does not permit\nordinary losses from the sales of securities to increase a NOL of a QSF. Consequently,\nif the Trust treats the ------- sales of its securities as sales producing ordinary losses, it\nmay not include these sales in its NOL calculation. The Trust\u2019s arguments that ordinary losses can increase a QSF\u2019s NOL are meritless In spite of the plain language of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-2(b), the Trust asserts that it may\nincrease a NOL by ordinary losses because (1) it could be classified as an association\ntaxable as a corporation and thus allowed a larger NOL under the provisions of I.R.C.\n\u00a7 172 and (2) it has a negative modified gross income that permits the claimed larger\nNOL. With respect to the first argument, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-1(b) provides in part that: If a fund, account, or trust that is a qualified settlement fund could be classified\nas a trust within the meaning of 301.7701-4 of this chapter, it is classified as a\nqualified settlement fund for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). If a fund, account, or trust, organized as a trust under applicable state law, is a\nqualified settlement fund, and could be classified as either an association (within\nthe meaning of \u00a7 301.7701\u20132 of this chapter) or a partnership (within the\nmeaning of \u00a7 301.7701\u20133 of this chapter), it is classified as a qualified settlement\nfund for all purposes of the Code. Although the Trust admits it is a QSF, it argues that absent this classification, it would\nbe classified as an association taxable as a corporation and therefore entitled to a NOL\ncarryback as claimed on the amended ------- Form 1120-SF. This argument is meritless\n4 As noted previously, the Trust recharacterized the sales of its securities from sales producing capital\ngain to sales producing ordinary income on its ------- amended Form 1120-SF. [Type text]\nunder the plain language of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-1(b). Additionally, as noted above, if\nan association meets the three requirements of a QSF pursuant to Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.468B-3(c), it is subject to taxation as a QSF under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-2;\napplication of the QSF rules are not elective. See Preamble to T.D. 8459. Thus, the\nTrust\u2019s argument that it is classified as a QSF but taxed as a corporation is meritless\nunder the plain language of the I.R.C. \u00a7 468B regulations and the Preamble to these\nregulations; there is no authority for the Trust\u2019s proposed hybrid classification. The Trust\u2019s second argument is that it has negative modified gross income resulting\nfrom the failure to recover the tax basis of assets sold during the taxable year and that\npermits it to claim a larger NOL under Treas.

Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-2(b)(4). Treasury\nRegulation \u00a7 1.468B-2(b) provides that the modified gross income of a QSF is its gross\nincome, as defined in I.R.C. \u00a7 61, computed with certain modifications. Section 61(a) provides generally that gross income means all income from whatever\nsource derived, except as otherwise provided in subtitle A. Section 61(a)(3) provides\nthat gross income includes \u201c[g]ains derived from dealings in property.\u201d See also Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.61-6. Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 1001(a) provides that the gain from the sale or\nother disposition of property shall be the excess of the amount realized over the\nadjusted basis provided in I.R.C. \u00a7 1011, and the loss shall be the excess of the\nadjusted basis over the amount realized. See also Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1001-1(a). Section\n1001(c) provides that, except as otherwise provided in subtitle A of the Code, the entire\namount of the gain or loss on the sale or exchange of property shall be recognized. As a general matter, I.R.C. \u00a7 1 imposes a tax on \u201ctaxable income. \u201d Section 63 provides\nthat the term \u201ctaxable income\u201d means gross income minus the deductions allowed\nunder chapter 1 of the Code. One of those deductions is I.R.C. \u00a7 165. Section 165(a)\nprovides the general rule that a deduction is allowed for any loss sustained during the\ntaxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. As discussed above,\n\u00a7 165(f) provides that losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed\nonly to the extent allowed in \u00a7\u00a7 1211 and 1212, and \u00a7 165(g) provides rules applicable\nwhen securities that are capital assets become worthless during the taxable year. It is clear under the plain language of the Code that gross income under \u00a7 61(a)(3) is\nnever a negative amount. That section plainly states that gross income includes\n\u201c[g]ains derived from dealings in property.\u201d Also, under the statutory structure of the\nCode, losses from the sale or other disposition of property are accounted for through\ndeductions under \u00a7 165, not through negative adjustments under \u00a7 61(a)(3). Treasury\nRegulation \u00a7 1.468B-2(b)(3) provides for the deduction of only capital losses, which are\nallowed only to the extent of gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets. Ordinary\nlosses that arise from the sale, exchange, or worthlessness of property are not\ndeductible under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-2(b); thus, ordinary losses are not taken into\naccount in calculating a NOL under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-2(b)(4). The Trust cites various court cases in support of its argument. However, those cases\nare inapplicable and irrelevant because they do not show that gross income under \u00a7 [Type text]\n61(a)(3) could ever be a negative amount. For example, in Davis v. United States, 87\nF.2d 323 (2d Cir. 1937), cert. denied, 301 U.S. 704 (1937), the court recognized the\ndistinction between gross receipts and gross income and the items constitutionally\nrequired to reduce gross receipts to gross income.",

However, the Second Circuit\u2019s\ndiscussion pertained only to calculating the amount of gross receipts. Similarly, in\nsupport of the proposition that a fundament tax principle in calculating gross income is\nrecovery of an asset\u2019s tax basis, the Trust cites The Pittsburgh Milk Company v.\nCommissioner, 26 T.C. 707 (1956), nonacq., 1959-2 C.B. 8. Once more, this\nfundamental tax principle does not answer the question here. In support of the\nproposition that gross income can be a negative figure when reduced by the tax basis of\nassets, the Trust cites Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189 (1920). The issue before the\nCourt was whether undivided profits in the form of stock dividends extraordinary in\namount were taxable income. Thus, the Court decided a different issue than the issue\nhere. 2. The Trust should have treated the sales of its securities on its ------- Form 1120-SF\nand its amended ------- Form 1120-SF as producing capital losses/gains instead of\nordinary losses/income. As explained above, the Trust treated the sales of its securities as sales producing\ncapital gains/losses on its original Forms 1120-AF for taxable years prior to -------. Starting with its ------- Form 1120-SF, the Trust treated the sales of securities as sales\nproducing ordinary losses/income. The Trust filed an amended ------- Form 1120-SF\nbased on a claimed NOL carryback from -------. It also recharacterized the sales of its\nsecurities during ------- from sales producing capital gain to sales producing ordinary\nincome. As discussed below, we think the sales of the Trust\u2019s securities in ------- and --------- produced capital gains/losses, not ordinary income/losses. Definition of capital asset\nInternal Revenue Code \u00a7 1221(a) provides that the term \u201ccapital asset\u201d means property\nheld by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business),\nwith the exception of the items listed in \u00a7\u00a7 1221(a)(1) through 1221(a)(8). Section\n1221(a)(1) includes stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind that would\nproperly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the\ntaxable year or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the\nordinary course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. 5 The Trust is not engaged in a business 5 Section 1221(a)(2) includes property, used in the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business, of a character that is\nsubject to the allowance for depreciation provided in I.R.C. \u00a7 167, or real property used in the taxpayer\u2019s\ntrade or business. This exception clearly cannot apply because the securities are not depreciable or real\nproperty.

The primary purpose for\nthe Trust\u2019s activity as a QSF is not for income or profit, as required by Groetzinger. Consequently, the Trust is not engaged in a business of being a QSF.

It appears that the Trust also argues that it is somehow in a business involving the\npurchase and sale of securities. It is well-settled that a taxpayer who purchases and\nsells securities falls into one of three distinct categories: dealer, trader, or investor. Arberg v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2007-244 (citing King v. Commissioner, 89 T.C.\n445, 457-459 (1987)). A dealer is engaged in the business of buying and selling\nsecurities, and such a business involves sales to customers. King v. Commissioner, 89\nT.C. at 457. Dealers purchase securities with the expectation of realizing a profit not\nbecause of a rise in value, but merely because they have or hope to find a market of\nbuyers who will purchase from them at a price in excess of their cost. Marrin v.\nCommissioner, 147 F.3d 147, 150-152 (2d Cir. 1998). Securities in the hands of\ndealers are excluded from the definition of a capital asset, falling within the exception for\n\"property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of\n[the taxpayer\u2019s] trade or business\" under \u00a7 1221(a)(1). A trader is engaged in the\nbusiness of buying and selling securities, but traders do so for their own account. Arberg v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2007-244.",

Hence, their securities are not\nexcluded from the definition of a capital asset due to the absence of customers, and\nsales thereof produce capital gains and losses unless they make a mark-to-market\nelection pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 475(f), with the consequence that gains and losses are\ntreated as ordinary in character under \u00a7\u00a7 475(d)(3)(A)(i) and (f)(1)(D). Id. Traders seek\nto profit from short-term market swings and receive income principally from selling on an\nexchange rather than from dividends, interest, or long-term appreciation. King v.\nCommissioner, 89 T.C. at 457-459. An investor is someone who makes purchases for\ncapital appreciation and income, usually without regard to short-term developments that [Type text]\nwould influence prices on the daily markets, and who seeks profits through dividends,\ninterest, or long-term gains. Id. Investors buy and sell securities for their own account,\nbut they are not considered to be in a trade or business no matter how much time or\nresources they expend on the activity. Id. at 459. Their sales produce capital gains and\nlosses. In its response to IDR No. 3, the Trust stated that it did not hold itself out to any third\nparty as a dealer in securities or a trader in securities. Moreover, the Trust has not\nidentified any \u201ccustomers\u201d to whom it sold securities. Dealers purchase securities with\nthe expectation of realizing a profit not because of a rise in value, but merely because\nthey have or hope to find a market of buyers who will purchase from them at a price in\nexcess of their cost. Marrin v. Commissioner, 147 F.3d at 150-152. The Trust is clearly\nnot engaged in the business of being a dealer in securities. Similarly, the Trust is clearly not engaged in the business of being a trader in securities. Traders seek to profit from short-term market swings and receive income principally\nfrom selling on an exchange rather than from dividends, interest, or long-term\nappreciation. King v. Commissioner, 89 T.C. at 457-459. \u201cIn distinguishing a trader\nfrom an investor, courts consider the following nonexclusive factors: (1) The taxpayer's\nintent, (2) the nature of the income to be derived from the activity, and (3) the frequency,\nextent, and regularity of the taxpayer's securities transactions.\u201d Van der Lee v.\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 2011-234, aff\u2019d, 501 Fed. App\u2019x 30 (2d Cir. 2012). The\nTrust did not seek to profit from short-term market swings and receive income\nprincipally from selling on an exchange rather than from dividends, interest, or long-term\nappreciation. Furthermore, even if the Trust were in the business of being a trader, its\nsales of securities would produce capital gains and losses unless it made a mark-tomarket election pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 475(f), which it did not do. We think the facts clearly show that the Trust was not engaged in any business and that\nit bought and sold the securities as an investor. Therefore, the sales produced capital\ngains and losses.",
