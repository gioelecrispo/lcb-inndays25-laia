The advice\nrendered is conditioned on the accuracy of the facts provided. Please contact the\nundersigned if any part of the stated facts is inaccurate as the legal conclusion\nmay be affected. ISSUES\n1. Whether ----------------------------------- (\u201cTaxpayer\u201d) has filed procedurally valid\nprotective claims and/or refund claims prior to the expiration of the period for\nfiling refund claims for the tax years --------through --------(excepting -------) (\u201cclaim\nyears at issue\u201d) for which Taxpayer is claiming a Foreign Tax Credit (\u201cFTC\u201d)\npursuant to perfecting the protective claims. 1\n2. Whether Taxpayer has exhausted all effective and practical remedies to reduce\nits foreign tax liability and is therefore entitled to FTC for taxes paid on a\nconstructive dividend, representing the difference between the interest rate\ncharged on a loan to --------------------------(\u201cUSSub\u201d) from its indirectly-owned\ncontrolled foreign corporation, ------------------------------------------------------------------(\u201cCFC2\u201d) and the arms-length interest rate determined by the ------------------------------------- (\u201cForeign Tax Agency\u201d), if it initially sought Competent Authority\n(\u201cCA\u201d) relief for the tax years --------through --------(\u201ctax years at issue\u201d) but later 1 Taxpayer resolved the issue with the Foreign Tax Agency through tax year -------. Taxpayer elected to\nclaim deductions, rather than foreign tax credits, for foreign taxes paid with respect to post ---------tax\nyears. No refund was claimed for the --------tax year. 2\nrejected the CA proposal, instead pursuing remedies in the Swiss (\u201cForeign\u201d)\ncourt system, and eventually reaching a resolution with the Foreign Tax Agency. CONCLUSIONS 1. The protective claims filed by Taxpayer, in which it preserved its right to file\nrefund requests based upon FTCs claimed for each of the claim years at issue,\ncontingent upon the final determination with respect to the amount of withholding\ntax on a constructive dividend, are procedurally valid protective claims in that\nsuch claims contain sufficient information to apprise the Service of the grounds\nupon which Taxpayer is claiming the credit subject to the resolution of the\ncontingency. Additionally, the protective claims for the claim years at issue were\ntimely filed prior to six months before the expiration of the duly executed\nextended statutory periods of limitation for each of the respective years. 2. Taxpayer\u2019s litigation of the Foreign tax dispute through the Foreign Supreme\nCourt exhausted its Foreign law remedies with respect to the interest rate\ncharged on the loan from CFC2 to USSub, but not with respect to the applicable\nwithholding tax rate, which the Foreign courts did not address. Taxpayer\u2019s\nsubsequent acceptance of a higher interest rate than that affirmed by the Foreign\ncourts, in connection with a favorable settlement of the withholding tax rate issue\nwith the Foreign Tax Agency, should be evaluated based on an assessment of\nthe hazards under Foreign law with respect to the availability of the treaty rate. Taxpayer\u2019s rejection of the CA proposed settlement does not constitute a failure\nto exhaust its effective and practical remedies under the treaty, if it reasonably\nbelieved based on competent Foreign law advice that it could further reduce\nUSSub\u2019s and CFC2\u2019s Foreign tax liability by litigating in the Foreign courts.",

However, correlative adjustments to the U.S. withholding tax liability of CFC2 are\nnot properly considered a cost of minimizing either USSub\u2019s or CFC2\u2019s Foreign\ntax liability. FACTS\nCFC2 is a wholly-owned Foreign subsidiary of --------------------------(\u201cCFC1\u201d), which is a\nwholly-owned foreign subsidiary of USSub. Prior to -------, CFC1 operated as an\ninternational marketing vehicle and was responsible for purchasing products\nmanufactured by USSub and selling them to unrelated foreign distributors. CFC2\nserved as the finance subsidiary for the global group. In -------, Taxpayer and the IRS\nsettled a transfer pricing controversy with respect to sales by USSub to CFC1 for tax\nyears --------------. Under the settlement, USSub established an account receivable and\nCFC1 an account payable in the amount of the agreed transfer pricing adjustment. USSub then contributed to CFC1 the accounts receivable, which were then cancelled. The Foreign Tax Agency had informed CFC1 that repatriation of the adjustment amount\ndue from CFC1 to USSub would be treated as a dividend subject to withholding tax, but\na loan of equal amount would not be treated as a taxable dividend repatriation. In 3\naddition, if instead of lending funds directly to USSub, CFC1 loaned funds to CFC2 and\nCFC2 loaned funds to USSub, so that CFC1 would not receive interest income directly\nfrom USSub, dividends later paid by CFC1 to USSub would receive the benefit of a\nwithholding rate of -- percent, rather than the standard rate of --- percent, pursuant to\nthe ------- Convention Between the United States of America and -----------------------------for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income (\u201cTreaty\u201d). 2\nPursuant to the terms of an agreement between the Foreign Tax Agency and the\nTaxpayer group (\u201c--------Agreement\u201d), CFC1 lent $------------------to CFC2, which CFC2\nthen lent to USSub. 3 Because the loan was payable on demand, the variable interest\nrate was set equal to the applicable federal rate (\u201cAFR\u201d) for comparable short-term\nloans. During the period --------through -------, USSub accrued total interest expense\ndue to CFC2 of $-----------------, which Taxpayer deducted from its U.S. income tax\nreturns for the same period, and included a corresponding amount on its returns as U.S.\nsource subpart F income of CFC2. See IRC Section 904(h)(1)(A)(i). USSub withheld\nU.S. tax at the 5 percent treaty rate on the U.S. source interest payments made at the\nshort-term rate to CFC2. In -------, during an audit of CFC2, the Foreign Tax Agency determined that the interest\nrate on the loan from CFC2 to USSub was not arms-length; rather, the Foreign Tax\nAgency determined that the proper rate would be the interest rate applicable to longterm industrial obligations. Its decision was based on the length of time the loan was\noutstanding (more than one year) and the fact that the loan was granted in the context\nof industrial enterprise.",

The Foreign Tax Agency determined that the underpayment of\ninterest resulted in a constructive dividend from CFC2 to USSub subject to a ----percent\nwithholding rate, finding the more favorable --percent rate applicable only in cases in\nwhich the shareholder receiving the dividend holds at least a minority participation\ndirectly in the distributing Foreign company. CFC2 contested the adjustment proposed by the Foreign Tax Agency, and along with\nTaxpayer, proposed that the parties use an -------percent interest rate for all the tax\nyears at issue. 4 The Foreign Tax Agency ultimately rejected the proposals and applied\nthe interest rates associated with long-term U.S. bonds to the tax years at issue; such\nrates ranged from a low of -------percent to a high of --------percent.5 On --------------------2 Under -----------------of the Treaty, dividends paid by a Foreign subsidiary to its U.S. parent may be\nsubject to a ---percent withholding rate (as opposed to ----percent) if not more than ----percent of the\ngross income of the paying corporation is derived from interest and dividends, other than interest and\ndividends received from the payer\u2019s own subsidiary. Although a Foreign company that receives interest\nincome subject to the beneficial --percent Treaty rate must distribute at least --- percent of that income\nannually, the Foreign Tax Agency agreed to suspend the distribution requirement for five years if CFC1\nagreed to continue to do business in ---------------- for that period. 3 Taxpayer claims that, based on this agreement with the Foreign Tax Agency, it understood that going\nforward, the rate of withholding would be --percent on all dividends distributed to Taxpayer. 4 The interest rates on the loan during the tax years at issue ranged from a low of ------ percent to a high\nof -------percent. 5 The Foreign Tax Agency also noted that, during the same period of time, CFC1 was granted U.S. loans\non which interest was due at the rate of ---- and --- percent. 4\n-------, the Foreign Tax Agency submitted its decision to CFC2, finding constructive\ndividends in the amount of ----------------------, upon which it assessed a ----percent\nwithholding tax, totaling --------------------------, for the tax years at issue. CFC2 appealed\nthis decision with the Foreign Tax Agency, asserting that the AFR short-term loan rate\npublished by the IRS is equivalent to market rate with respect to its intercompany loan\nbecause of the demand note nature of the loan. Additionally, CFC2 disputed the\nwithholding rate of ----percent, referencing the ------- Agreement, which CFC2\nunderstood to mean that any future interest insufficiencies would be subject to a\nwithholding rate of --percent. On ----------------------, Taxpayer requested CA assistance regarding the amount of\ninterest properly chargeable on the loan from CFC2 to USSub for the tax years at issue,\nwith potential application to subsequent tax years.

In its CA request, Taxpayer argued that the short-term interest rate was an\nappropriate arms-length rate, given the demand nature of the loan in question; that the\nForeign tax was imposed on \u201cincome\u201d that does not exist for U.S. purposes in\naccordance with the IRC Section 482 regulations, because, as stated by Taxpayer, the\n\u201ctransfer pricing\u2026 was acknowledged to be at arm\u2019s length from a U.S. perspective;\u201d\nand, that, even if the tax were properly withheld on the constructive dividend, the --percent withholding rate was inconsistent with the Treaty. On ------------------, the Foreign Tax Agency issued its Decision on Appeal, in which it\nupheld its determination that the loan was long-term in nature, and, therefore, the\ninterest rates it determined were consistent with that finding. Additionally, the Foreign\nTax Agency confirmed the withholding rate of ----percent. In accordance with the\nForeign Federal Withholding Tax Statute, the Foreign Tax Agency determined that\nCFC2 must pay a withholding tax of ---------------------------and pass the burden of the tax\nonto USSub, the entity receiving the constructive dividend. The Foreign Tax Agency\nexplained that, in accordance with the Treaty, Foreign withholding tax on a dividend\nmay not exceed --percent when the shareholder is a company that directly or indirectly\ncontrols ----percent of the voting rights of the company paying a dividend and when not\nmore than ----percent of the gross income of the company paying a dividend stems from\ninterest or dividends other than those paid by its own subsidiaries. The Foreign Tax\nAgency noted that, while USSub controls CFC1 and CFC1 controls CFC2, USSub is not\na \u201cshareholder\u201d which controls CFC2 directly or indirectly to the extent of more than ----percent. The Foreign Tax Agency claims the Foreign Federal Tribunal\u2019s interpretation\n6 The increased interest that USSub is deemed to have paid by virtue of the adjustment is being treated\nby the Foreign Tax Agency as having been distributed to USSub and, therefore, is considered a\nconstructive dividend. 5\nof the relevant treaty provision is that USSub must hold at least a minority participation\ndirectly in CFC2 to be entitled to the beneficial rate. With respect to the --percent\nwithholding tax rate referenced in the ------- Agreement, upon which CFC2 claims it\nrelied, the Foreign Tax Agency found the reliance misplaced because the --------Agreement regarding interest payable by USSub to CFC2 anticipated that the interest\nrates would be in line with market. When such rates are determined not to be in line\nwith the market rates, the consequences are outside the framework of the ------Agreement, which solidified an amicable solution, as opposed to a litigated one.

On ------------------------, the IRS notified Taxpayer of the CA proposed resolution to\neliminate economic double taxation. The CA determined the arms-length interest rate\non the loan to be -------percent,7 which reduced the total constructive dividend for the tax\nyears at issue from ----------------------, as originally determined by the Foreign Tax\nAgency, to ----------------------. Additionally, the U.S. would provide correlative relief for\nthis increase in CFC2\u2019s income by allowing Taxpayer a corresponding interest\ndeduction of USD ---------------. The U.S. and Foreign competent authorities further\nagreed that the Foreign withholding tax rate on the constructive dividend to USSub\nwould be --percent8 and that the U.S. would also apply a --percent withholding tax on\nthe additional interest deemed paid by USSub to CFC2. The CA Disposition Memo also\nstated that Taxpayer could claim a foreign tax deduction or credit for the Foreign\nwithholding tax that was paid on the constructive dividend to the extent permitted by\nU.S. domestic law, as well as a deemed-paid credit for additional Foreign tax paid by\nCFC2 with respect to the subpart F income resulting from the additional interest income. The CA proposal was applicable to the tax years at issue and not binding in subsequent\nyears. On --------------------------, Taxpayer withdrew its request for CA assistance based on its\nview that the terms of the CA agreement are unacceptable. Taxpayer objected to the\nproposed imposition of a U.S. withholding tax on the proposed adjustment amount,\nwhich was based on an interest rate for the intercompany loan that Taxpayer\ncharacterized as well in excess of the short-term rate, which Taxpayer claims the IRS\nexam team agreed was an arm\u2019s-length rate under U.S. principles and law.

On ---------------------, Taxpayer began filing protective claims preserving its right to file\nclaims for refund or credit with respect to potential future payment of Foreign\nwithholding taxes if the Foreign determination of additional interest income of CFC2 and\na constructive dividend to USSub were upheld. 9 The assessment statute expiration\ndate (\u201cASED\u201d) for each tax year had been extended under agreement pursuant to IRC\n6511(c). Each of the protective claims was filed prior to six months from the applicable\nASED, as reflected on IRS transcripts. 10\nOn ------------------, Appeals dismissed CFC2\u2019s appeal dated -------------------and upheld\nthe determination and amount of the constructive dividend. It did not address the issue\nof levying the withholding tax at a reduced rate of --percent, considering that that issue\nwould be the object of a separate procedure. CFC2 responded to the dismissal by filing\nan appeal of that decision with the Foreign Supreme Court on ------------------. In its\npetition, CFC2 requested that the Foreign Supreme Court find that CFC2 did not pay a\nconstructive dividend to USSub; but if it determined that a constructive dividend was\npaid, then CFC2 also requested the withholding tax rate be immediately reduced to --percent, given CFC2\u2019s interest in the issue and the interests of procedural swiftness. CFC2 argued in its petition that it qualified for the withholding tax beneficial rate of --percent because it met the three necessary conditions: 1) dividends are at stake; 2) the\nshareholder (USSub) is a company controlling, directly or indirectly, at least ---% of the\nvotes of the company paying the dividends (CFC2); and (3) the gross income of the\ncompany paying the dividends does not include over ----percent of interest or dividends\nother than those issued from its own subsidiaries.

With respect to the withholding tax rate, Appeals\nmaintained that, although initially the --percent withholding tax rate issue was before it,\nin CFC2\u2019s rejoinder dated -------------------, CFC2 agreed to delay the examination of the\n-- percent withholding tax rate to a future tax reimbursement procedure. Accordingly,\nbecause CFC2 had restricted its pleas to the sole issue of the existence of a\nconstructive dividend, the issue of the withholding tax rate was not before the Foreign\nSupreme Court. Nevertheless, Appeals maintained that the proper withholding tax rate\nwould be ----percent, the rate associated with constructive dividends under Foreign\nfederal law. The debtor of the taxable provision, in this case CFC2, is obligated then to\ntransfer the tax burden to its beneficiary, i.e., USSub, who, if located abroad, seeks\nrelief, as appropriate, through the Treaty. Appeals explained that the relevant Treaty\nprovision effectively institutes a simplified administration process by which the debtor\ndirectly pays the rate corresponding to the non-refundable portion of the withholding tax\namount and the Treaty allows the beneficiary of the taxable provision subject to\nwithholding tax to avoid having to request the reimbursement of the tax later on. Nevertheless, Appeals maintained that this administrative convenience is applicable\nonly in a non-contentious context and not in a case where the underlying adjustment is\nbeing disputed. On -------------------, the Foreign Supreme Court rendered its decision, limiting its review\nto claims and pleas that were the objects of the decision of the lower judiciary court. Accordingly, the Foreign Supreme Court did not consider the withholding tax rate as an\nissue before it. With respect to the interest rate on the loan from CFC2 to USSub, the\nForeign Supreme Court determined that the loan was more appropriately characterized\nas long-term rather than short-term, given the fact that no payment had been made\nduring the course of the litigation and the interest was capitalized by increasing the\nprincipal amount due. Such favorable loan terms, the Foreign Supreme Court\nconcluded, would not have been granted to a third-party debtor; instead, the lender\nwould have demanded interest based on the higher rates of long-term loans.

Section 6511(c) provides that if\nan agreement pursuant to IRC Section 6501(c)(4) is executed, thereby extending the\nperiod for assessment, the period for filing a claim for credit or refund shall not expire\nprior to 6 months after the expiration of the period within which an assessment may be\nmade pursuant to the extension agreement. In the case at hand, the ASEDs, as\nreflected on IRS transcripts, support Taxpayer\u2019s position that the statutes were open to\nsupport claims for refund attributable to foreign taxes paid with respect to the tax years -------through --------at the time Taxpayer filed its protective claims. In addition to being timely filed, protective claims must also contain sufficient information\nto apprise the Service of the basis for the credit or refund claims in accordance with\nTreasury Regulations Section 301.6402-2. This requirement is generally satisfied as\nlong as the claim is sufficiently clear and definite to apprise the Service of the essential\nnature of the claims, even though it does not state facts sufficient to establish that the\ntaxpayer is actually entitled to recover an overpayment. See GCM 38786, 1981 WL\n169576. Thus, a valid protective claim need not state a particular dollar amount or\ndemand an immediate refund, but it must be sufficient to put the Service on notice that a\ntax refund is sought, focus the Service\u2019s attention on the merits of the claim, and identify\nthe specific years for which a refund is sought. See United States v. Kales, 314 U.S.\n186 (1941); IRM 25.6.1.10.2.6.5(2) (5-17-2004).

This subjects the entity to\ndouble taxation when income earned abroad is taxed by both the United States and the\nforeign country in which the income is earned. To alleviate the double taxation, IRC\nSection 901(a) allows the taxpayer a credit for foreign income taxes paid or accrued,\nthereby reducing the taxpayer\u2019s U.S. tax liability by the amount of taxes paid to the\nforeign country, such that the total amount of tax paid to all countries is the same\namount of tax that would have resulted if the income had been subject to tax only once\nat the U.S. corporate rate. Subject to the limitation of IRC Section 904, IRC Section\n901(b)(1) allows citizens and domestic corporations a foreign tax credit in the amount of\nany income, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable\nyear to any foreign country. Treasury Regulations Section 1.901-2 sets forth the requirements that must be met in\norder to determine whether a foreign levy is a tax such that a taxpayer can claim a\nforeign tax credit for payment made to a foreign country. A foreign levy is a tax if it\nrequires a compulsory payment pursuant to the authority of a foreign country to levy\ntaxes. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.901-2(a)(2)(i). An amount paid is not a compulsory payment to\nthe extent that it exceeds the amount of liability under foreign law for tax. Treas. Reg. \u00a7\n1.901-2(e)(5)(i). Treasury Regulations Section 1.901-2(e)(5)(i) further provides: An amount paid does not exceed the amount of such liability if the amount paid is\ndetermined by the taxpayer in a manner that is consistent with a reasonable\ninterpretation and application of the substantive and procedural provisions of\nforeign law (including applicable tax treaties) in such a way as to reduce, over\ntime, the taxpayer\u2019s reasonably expected liability under foreign law for tax, and if\nthe taxpayer exhausts all effective and practical remedies, including invocation of\ncompetent authority procedures available under applicable tax treaties, to\n14 Taxpayer filed Form 1120X for tax year --------as well, for which the claim filing deadline had been\nextended to --------------------. 15\nTaxpayer did not file claims for tax years --------through -------, electing instead to take a deduction for\nwithholding taxes paid in tax year --------with respect to those years. 11\nreduce, over time, the taxpayer\u2019s liability for foreign tax (including liability\npursuant to a foreign tax audit adjustment). With respect to the interpretation of foreign law, the regulations allow the taxpayer to\nrely on advice from foreign tax advisors. See id. Remedies pursued by the taxpayer\nare considered effective and practical only if the associated costs, including the risk of\noffsetting or additional foreign tax liability, are reasonable, taking into account the\namount at issue and the likelihood of success. Id. In this case, Taxpayer sought CA assistance regarding the audit adjustment proposed\nby the Foreign Tax Agency with respect to both the determination of additional interest\nincome to CFC2 and a constructive dividend to USSub and, in the event such\ndetermination was upheld, the applicable withholding tax rate on the dividend.",

Taxpayer withdrew its request for CA assistance, objecting to the proposed settlement\nterms that included an additional U.S. withholding tax due from CFC2 on the additional\ninterest income due from USSub to CFC2. In response to an Information Document\nRequest, Taxpayer stated that, \u201cThe additional U.S. taxes proposed by CA were an\n\u2018additional tax liability\u2019 that added to [Taxpayer]\u2019s costs and when taken into account at\nthe relevant time made the CA proposal a remedy that was not effective and practical\npursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.901-2(e)(5).\u201d Taxpayer had separate obligations to minimize USSub\u2019s Foreign withholding tax\nimposed on the constructive dividend and CFC2\u2019s liability for Foreign net income taxes\nimposed on its interest income. The U.S. withholding tax that would have been\nimposed on CFC2 as part of the CA settlement is not properly considered a cost of\nminimizing CFC2\u2019s Foreign tax liability. It would completely undermine the purpose of\nthe noncompulsory payment rules to consider correlative adjustments of U.S. tax to be\ncosts of obtaining a reduction of foreign tax that can justify not pursuing an effective and\npractical remedy, because the anticipated consequence of any reduction in foreign tax\nand associated FTCs is generally an increase in U.S. tax. In any event, in this case\nCFC2\u2019s U.S. withholding tax would decrease, not increase, with any reduction of\nCFC2\u2019s Foreign net income tax liability as part of a bilateral CA agreement. Moreover,\nU.S. withholding tax imposed on CFC2 is not a cost of minimizing Foreign withholding\ntax imposed on USSub, a separate taxpayer. 16 Accordingly, collateral U.S. tax\nconsequences of settling its Foreign tax dispute are not properly taken into account as\ncosts of pursuing any avenue of relief available to Taxpayer. Rather, the 16 Notice 2007-95, 2007-49 I.R.B. 1091, permits taxpayers to rely on 2007 proposed amendments to\nTreas. Reg. section 1.901-2(e)(5)(iii) and (iv) that would treat as a single taxpayer all foreign entities in a\nU.S.-owned foreign group. Thus, the proposed regulations would allow taxpayers to consider all\nmembers in a chain of CFCs as a single taxpayer in applying the obligation to minimize the creditable\nforeign taxes paid by the group members that are eligible to be deemed paid under IRC section 902. However, the proposed regulations do not include U.S. shareholders in the definition of a U.S.-owned\nforeign group. Further, the notice is only effective for tax years ending on or after March 29, 2007. Therefore, Notice 2007-95 and the 2007 proposed regulations are inapplicable to the case at hand. 12\nreasonableness of Taxpayer\u2019s settlement must be evaluated based on the potential\nbenefits, risks and non-U.S.-tax costs of continuing to contest the Foreign adjustments.",

Revenue Procedure 2006-54 provides that the fact that a taxpayer who seeks CA\nassistance but obtains no relief because the taxpayer rejects an agreement reached by\nthe CA generally will not, in and of itself, demonstrate that it has exhausted all effective\nand practical remedies to reduce its foreign tax liability. Therefore, Taxpayer is required\nto demonstrate that it rejected the CA settlement to pursue other administrative and\nlitigation remedies because it reasonably believed resort to the Foreign administrative\nprocess and courts could achieve a greater reduction in its Foreign tax liability. In maintaining that it thought it could achieve a better result in the Foreign court system\nthan that proposed by the CA, Taxpayer claims that it relied on the advice of foreign tax\nadvisors. Although it has not produced any written opinions of such advisors, upon\nrejecting the CA proposal Taxpayer appealed the Foreign Tax Agency\u2019s determination\nwith respect to the interest rate to Appeals and eventually the Foreign Supreme Court. Although the proposed CA settlement was based on a smaller amount of constructive\ndividend than it ultimately obtained through its litigation and settlement with the Foreign\nTax Agency, the exhaustion of remedies requirement is based on reasonable\nexpectations at the time the avenue of relief is foregone, not hindsight. Given that\nTaxpayer pursued its claim to reduce the interest rate through Foreign appellate\nproceedings through to the Foreign Supreme Court, it is reasonable to infer that\nTaxpayer believed it could achieve a lower interest rate than that offered in the CA\nsettlement by litigating the interest rate issue in the Foreign courts. In our view, in light\nof Taxpayer\u2019s subsequent prosecution of the contest a court would likely determine that\nits rejection of the CA settlement proposal to pursue local Foreign law remedies did not\nconstitute a failure to exhaust its effective and practical remedies to minimize its Foreign\ntax liability. In addition, although the Foreign courts upheld a higher interest rate than the IRS\ndetermined constituted an arms-length rate under U.S. tax principles, the relevant\nstandard in determining whether the Foreign tax paid was compulsory is whether that\ndetermination was consistent with a reasonable application of Foreign tax law as\nmodified by the Treaty, not whether the result is consistent with the appropriate result\nunder U.S. tax law. See Schering Corp. and Subs v. Comm\u2019r, 69 T.C. 579 (1978)\n(holding the withholding taxes assessed on a dividend paid to Schering by its foreign\nCFC were compulsory taxes under IRC Section 901, even though the amount\nrepatriated did not constitute a dividend for U.S. tax purposes); --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Taxpayer\u2019s litigation of the interest rate dispute through the Foreign Supreme Court\nexhausted its Foreign law remedies with respect to the interest rate charged on the loan 13\nfrom CFC2 to USSub, but not with respect to the applicable withholding tax rate, which\nthe Foreign courts did not address.",

As discussed above, the Foreign Tax Agency\u2019s\nposition with respect to the applicable withholding tax rate was based on its\ninterpretation of the definition of a shareholder to include a direct ownership\nrequirement. Although CFC2\u2019s petition to the Foreign Supreme Court addressed the\nissue of the withholding tax rate, the Court did not rule on it because, as stated in\nAppeals\u2019 observations to the Court, that matter was not properly before the Court. Nevertheless, Appeals opined that it was not for the Foreign courts to decide whether\nUSSub was entitled to the beneficial withholding tax rate under the Treaty; rather, CFC2\nwas required to withhold at the ----percent rate and Taxpayer was required to pursue\nany refund for a withholding rate differential applicable under the Treaty. Because\nTaxpayer secured the benefit of the --percent Treaty rate in its eventual settlement with\nthe Foreign Tax Agency, in our view Taxpayer also exhausted its effective and practical\nremedies to reduce the applicable Foreign withholding tax rate. Taxpayer\u2019s acceptance of a higher interest rate than that affirmed by the Foreign courts,\nin connection with a favorable settlement of the Treaty rate issue for the tax years at\nissue and for subsequent years with the Foreign Tax Agency, should be evaluated\nbased on an assessment of the hazards under Foreign law with respect to the\navailability of the --percent Treaty rate. Taxpayer asserted that there was a substantial\nrisk that had it not agreed to the higher interest rate, it would not have obtained the\nbenefit of the --percent rate or extended the settlement terms to later years. Taxpayer\nalso maintains that it was advised by its Foreign tax counsel to accept the settlement\neventually proposed by the Foreign Tax Agency, characterizing it as very favorable,\nconsidering the expenses incurred to date and the fact that the settlement offer covered\nthirteen subsequent tax years as well as the tax years at issue. However, Taxpayer has\nnot produced an analysis of Foreign law or an opinion of its tax advisors in support of its\nposition. Taxpayer claims that it relied on advice obtained in good faith from foreign tax advisors\nto whom it disclosed relevant facts. Treas. Reg. Section 1.901-2(e)(5) provides that a\nremedy is effective and practical only if the cost thereof (including the risk of offsetting\nor additional tax liability) is reasonable in light of the amount at issue and the likelihood\nof success. In order to meet the requirements of the regulation, the advice of foreign\ncounsel must analyze the likelihood and projected cost of Taxpayer achieving a further\nreduction in its Foreign tax liability by rejecting the Foreign Tax Authority\u2019s proposed\nsettlement and pursuing further administrative or judicial proceedings.",
