Analysis In our opinion, the expenditures at issue are not deductible by the taxpayer as they are\nnot ordinary and necessary expenses of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. In order for an\nexpenditure to be deductible as advertising, the taxpayer has the burden of proving a\nproximate relationship between the expenditure and the corporation\u2019s business, that the\nactivity \u201cwas reasonably calculated to call public attention to its business in some manner\nthat might reasonably be expected to produce some patronage benefit,\u201d and that the\nexpenditure was reasonable in amount compared to the reasonably expected benefits. W.D. Gale v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1960-191. For example, in W.D. Gale v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1960-191, the principal\nshareholder of an electrical contracting business was prominent in motor boat racing. The\nexpenses of that activity were held not deductible by the corporation as the corporation was\nrarely mentioned in connection with the activity and, therefore, the business \u201creceived no\nsubstantial publicity\u201d from the racing program. Similarly, in Sieber v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1979-15, the taxpayer claimed that his\npolo-playing activities were expenditures for the advertising and promotion of his building\nconstruction business. The court stated that\nPetitioner has the burden of proof that his costs of playing polo were\nordinary and necessary expenses of that business under section 162. To\ncarry his burden, it is incumbent upon petitioner to show affirmatively that\nthe expenditures were undertaken primarily for a business, not a social or\npersonal, purpose and that there was a proximate, rather than merely a\nremote or incidental, relationship between the expenditures and petitioner's\nbusiness -- essentially a question of fact. His burden is not made easier by\nthe fact that the expenses involved are of a character which are normally CC:LM:RFPH:CHI:2:M:POSTF-130690-11 Page 7 personal and, therefore, may fall within the ambit of section 262,\nwhich takes precedence over section 162. We conclude that petitioner has\nnot carried his burden of proof. The weight of the evidence strongly\nsuggests that petitioner played polo primarily because it gave him personal\nsatisfaction and helped him maintain a close relationship with his family. [citations omitted.] As the court stated in Mathes v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1990-483,\nSection 162(a) is not a carte blanche grant by the Government for the right\nto deduct all expenses which arguably are somewhat related to an incomeproducing activity, no matter how unreasonable in amount.",

      "content": "[citations omitted.] As the court stated in Mathes v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1990-483,\nSection 162(a) is not a carte blanche grant by the Government for the right\nto deduct all expenses which arguably are somewhat related to an incomeproducing activity, no matter how unreasonable in amount. The element of\nreasonableness is inherent in the phrase \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d . . .\nwhether the amount of the deduction claimed is reasonable is determined\nunder the facts and circumstances of each case. The burden of proving that\nsuch amounts are reasonable rests with petitioner. In determining whether\nthe amount expended is reasonable, the amount of the expenditure has\nbeen compared with the benefit to be derived. [citations omitted.] Admittedly, it is not for the Service to decide whether a taxpayer\u2019s expenditure is the\nbest possible use of the company\u2019s funds, only whether it was ordinary and necessary in\npursuit of the business. Expenditures for advertising are deductible whether or not the\nadvertising is effective; they are even deductible if the advertising completely misfires and\nhas disastrous results for the company\u2019s sales and reputation. The deduction depends\nprimarily on whether the expenditure, at the time it was authorized, \u201cmight reasonably be\nexpected to produce some patronage benefit.\u201d On the other hand, the expenditure cannot\nhave merely a remote or tangential connection with promoting the company; and the\nexpense must be reasonable in amount compared to the reasonably expected benefits. Extravagant expenditures from which a reasonable person could expect only minimal\nbenefits are not deductible. As the court stated in Helstoski v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1990-382: We do not intend to suggest that we should, as a matter of course, secondguess taxpayers' business decisions or restrict taxpayers to deduction of\nonly the least expensive method of conducting their businesses. Nevertheless, when the individuals involved are major owners and ranking\nofficers of the business in question, and when the issue is whether the travel\nexpenses were primarily the personal expenses of those controlling\nindividuals or primarily business expenses, one factor that may bear upon\nthat issue is whether there are less expensive alternatives that would have\nbeen practical ways to conduct the business activities without so much, or\nso costly, travel. In your examination, the taxpayer has not demonstrated that the *** al -------------- was\nintended to benefit the reputation or increase the sales of the corporation. It has not\ndemonstrated that the results of the -------------- were disclosed to customers or potential CC:LM:RFPH:CHI:2:M:POSTF-130690-11 Page 8 customers (or were intended to be so disclosed) in any manner beyond the -----------exhibit, public report, and perhaps some other minimal publications. It has not proven that\nthe large expenses of the -------------- were reasonable in relation to the corporate benefits\nthat could reasonably be expected. We note also that, even if it could be established that the -------------- improved the\nreputation and goodwill of the *** ah family, such an accomplishment is not necessarily a\npromotion of the corporation itself and thus not deductible by the corporation.

The company has attempted to link the two, stating\nthat the company:\nprojects an image of a unique family culture founded on principles and\nvalues . . . [that] the *** aj represents the spirit of family, the spirit of\nadventure, and the spirit of leadership\u2014- all values that are part of who we\nare as a company . . . it highlights *** Taxpayer\u2019s family company\nmessage and celebrates its history . . . *** Taxpayer has qualified research\nshowing that consumers would rather buy from a family-owned business. .\n.. Creating an environment where emotional connections with the *** ah\nfamily and a sense of pride among employees are also very helpful in\ncreating a stronger, more vibrant company. We believe that any promotion of the good reputation of the *** ah family that may have\nresulted from the *** al -------------- is too remote from the promotion of the company and its\nproducts to qualify as a corporate advertising deduction. The taxpayer has referred to Poletti v. Commissioner, 330 F.2d 818 (8th Cir. 1964), in\nsupport of its deduction. In that case, the taxpayer ran an employment agency and gave\nfree gifts, both to individuals who sought placement through the agency and to companies\nwhere it placed employees. The court held such expenditures deductible, noting that a\ntaxpayer \u201cshould not be penalized taxwise for business ingenuity in utilizing advertising\ntechniques which do not conform to the practices of one whom he is naturally trying to\nsurpass in profits.\u201d Though this precedent no doubt endorses creativity in advertising, we do not believe it\nsupports the deduction at issue. Unlike Poletti, where it was obvious that the expenditure,\nthough unconventional, benefitted the company, the taxpayer here has not proven that the\nexpenditure resulted in any useful promotional communication to potential customers, or\nwas intended to do so, at least not on a scale commensurate to the size of the expenditure. Furthermore, the elements of personal pleasure cannot be ignored. Although we do not\ndoubt that the *** al -------------- had some historic element, the photographs and\ndescriptions of the --------------, as provided to the Service by the taxpayer, indicate that the CC:LM:RFPH:CHI:2:M:POSTF-130690-11 Page 9 president of the company, his mother, and other relatives enjoyed many recreational\namenities on this --------------, including diving, sailing, swimming, and other diversions. As\nnumerous judicial opinions indicate, these factors weigh in favor of a finding that the\nexpenses are non-deductible as \u201cpersonal, living, or family expenses\u201d under \u00a7 262 and\nagainst a finding of a business purpose under \u00a7 162(a). The fact that the expenses of five1\nfamily members who travelled on the expedition were not deducted on the corporate return\nsuggests that the expedition was primarily a family recreational event and not primarily\nbusiness-related.",

      "content": "The fact that the expenses of five1\nfamily members who travelled on the expedition were not deducted on the corporate return\nsuggests that the expedition was primarily a family recreational event and not primarily\nbusiness-related. The Regulations under \u00a7 162 envision three types of travel: (1) \u201cSolely on business,\u201d in\nwhich case all reasonable and necessary travel expenses, including meals and lodging, are\ndeductible (Reg. \u00a7 1.162-2(a)); (2) travel that mixes personal and business, in which case\nthe expenses of travel to the destination are deductible if the trip is \u201cprimarily\u201d for business\n(Reg.\n\u00a7 1.162-2(b)(1)); and (3) travel \u201cprimarily personal in nature\u201d, in which case the\n\u201ctraveling expenses to and from the destination are not deductible even though the\ntaxpayer engages in business activities while at such destination\u201d but \u201cexpenses while at\nthe destination which are properly allocable to the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business are\ndeductible\u201d (Reg. \u00a7 1.162-2(b)(1)). In your examination the *** al expedition appears to be\nprimarily personal. The company has not established (and cannot establish) that any part\nof the expenses are business, because the only potentially business-related activity would\nbe advertising-related which (as explained above) is too insufficient to qualify as ordinary\nand necessary. As we do not believe the expenditures qualify under \u00a7 162, we do not reach the issue\nof whether they would be capitalized and amortized (rather than deducted currently) as\ndiscussed in Reg. \u00a7 1.162-20(a). Neither are the expenses deductible as a charitable contribution. Although a small --------------- documenting the *** al -------------- was placed in the taxpayer\u2019s ------------, that ------------------- is not a tax-exempt entity as defined in I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 170 and 501(c)(3). In\nconnection with the *** al --------------, no cash or other thing of value was transferred to a\ntax-exempt entity, nor did the company pay any expenses that were the legal obligation of\na tax-exempt entity. A charitable contribution deduction is thus not an appropriate\nalternative. As you have noted, the Service examined this taxpayer in previous years and did not\ndisallow deductions arising from a previous --------- (in -------) for the -------------------------------------------. We note that, as a matter of law, the Service is not required to treat a taxpayer\nconsistently from year to year; the fact that the Service allows a deduction in one year does\nnot bar the Service from disallowing a similar deduction in a later year. Each year stands\non its own. United States v. Skelly Oil Co., 394 U.S. 678, 684 (1969); Knights of Columbus\nCouncil #3660 v. United States, 783 F.2d 69 (7th Cir 1986); Rose v.

The first -------------- may have lacked the\nfamily vacation factors prominent in the second --------------. It is also possible that the\nearlier deduction simply escaped the Service\u2019s attention, or the amount was deemed\ninsignificant, or the pursuit of a deficiency was judged to be an unjustified use of the\nService\u2019s limited resources. Of course, we cannot now (on the grounds of consistency)\ndisallow the ------- deduction, as the statute of limitations on assessment has expired for\nthat fiscal year.

Consistency objections could also be raised due to the Service disallowing the costs of\nthe *** al -------------- of ------- while allowing other contributions to or expenses of the\ncompany ------------ in that year.

It is entirely\npossible that the taxpayer in this case can justify and substantiate that the ------------ in\ngeneral (and the ----- *** v are legitimate advertising expenses; we maintain, however, that\nthe taxpayer has not proven that the costs of the ----------------------were primarily business\nrather than personal under \u00a7\u00a7 162(a) and 262, and that the -------------- resulted in any\nuseful promotional communication to potential customers, or was intended to do so, at least\nnot on a scale commensurate to the size of the ----------------. Of course, consistent with the expense not being deductible on the corporate return, that\npart of the cost of the -------------- which is a personal benefit to the president of the\ncompany is income to him not reported on his return. It is at the discretion of the\nCompliance Division, however, whether an examination of the president\u2019s individual return\nshould be opened and an adjustment proposed; this decision involves matters regarding\nthe allocation of IRS time and resources that are beyond the scope of Counsel\u2019s knowledge\nand authority. Conclusion We conclude that there is no legal basis for deducting the costs of the fiscal year -----------------------to locate the ------------- of the ------------------.
