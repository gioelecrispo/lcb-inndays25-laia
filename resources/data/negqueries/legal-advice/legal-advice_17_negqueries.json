Prior to issuance, this advice was formally reviewed\nby National Office.

The losses were claimed\non deemed liquidations resulting from the change of entity\nclassification of each entity from a corporation to a disregarded\nentity.

The change in entity\nclassification from a corporation to a branch resulted in a\ndeemed liquidation of the corporations for U.S. tax purposes. See Treas. Reg. section 301.7701-3(g)(1). Taxpayer argues that as a result of the deemed liquidations,\nsection 165(g) permits the recognition of worthless stock losses\nin the amounts of ---- and ----, with respect to its stock in ---------and --, respectively. In addition, taxpayer argues that\nsection 166 permits the recognition of bad debt losses of -----------------and -----with respect to loans outstanding to --------and ----, respectively.2 The bad debt and worthless stock losses were claimed only\n2 The bad debt losses were calculated by subtracting from the\noutstanding loans balances the value of the assets of ------------ and --. for U.S. tax purposes and were not reflected for U.S. financial\nreporting purposes.

Debt \u2013 Equity Analysis The audit team engaged in a debt-equity analysis of the\nintercompany loans to -----and --. The audit team reached a\npreliminary determination that a significant portion of the loans\nshould be reclassified as equity. As a result of the\nreclassification, -----and ---would have been solvent at the time\nof the deemed liquidation. Since the entities were solvent,\nproperty would have been received by taxpayer in exchange for its\nstock in the liquidation. Section 332 provides that no gain or\nloss is recognized by a shareholder in the liquidation of a\ncorporation where property is received by the shareholder in\nexchange for its stock. Therefore, section 332 would apply and\ntaxpayer would not be entitled to a worthless stock loss under\nsection 165(g) with respect to its stock in -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------and --.3 The taxpayer has argued that any reclassified debt should be\ntreated as preferred stock since the advances were documented by\nnotes which provided for a stated rate of return on the advances. In a liquidation, property is deemed distributed first to\ncreditors, then to preferred shareholders and then to common\nshareholders. In our case, assuming that the value of the assets\nwould not satisfy taxpayer\u2019s entire investment in the preferred\nstock, no assets would be received on the common shares and\nsection 332 would not apply.

If the notes representing the advances to ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- and --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- were properly executed and\nenforceable, then the terms of the notes must be respected for\ntax purposes.

DISCUSSION\nA. Legal Authority An \"eligible entity\" can elect its classification for U.S.\ntax purposes. See Treas. Reg. section 301.7701-3. An eligible\nentity with a single owner can elect to be classified as an\nassociation (corporation) or to be disregarded as an entity\nseparate from its owner. Treas. Reg. Sec. 301.7701-3(a). If an eligible entity classified as an association elects to\nbe disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, the\nassociation is deemed to distribute all of its assets and\nliabilities to its single owner in liquidation of the\nassociation. Treas. Reg. section 301.7701-3(g)(1)(iii). A\nchange in entity classification is governed by all relevant\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code and general provisions of\ntax law, including the step transaction doctrine. Treas. Reg.\nsection 301.7701-3(g)(2). Pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 332, a shareholder recognizes no gain\nor loss upon the liquidation of a subsidiary if i) the\nshareholder possesses at least 80% of the total voting power of\nthe subsidiary stock and ii) the stock possessed by the\nshareholder constitutes at least 80% of the total value of all\nthe subsidiary stock. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 332 and 1504(a)(2). Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.332-2(b) provides that \u201csection 332 applies\nonly to those cases in which the recipient corporation receives\nat least partial payment for the stock which it owns in the\nliquidating corporation. If section 332 is inapplicable, see\nsection 165(g) relative to allowance of losses on worthless\nsecurities.\u201d Therefore, section 332 does not apply where the\nliquidating corporation is insolvent since the shareholder does not receive any property in exchange for its stock in the\nliquidation. 4 Where section 332 does not apply, a shareholder is entitled\nto a worthless stock loss pursuant to section 165(g) if it is\nestablished that the stock became worthless during the year at\nissue. If a taxpayer which is a domestic corporation owns stock\npossessing at least 80% of the voting power of all classes of the\nstock and at least 80% of the nonvoting stock of a foreign\ncorporation which becomes worthless during the taxable year, the\nloss resulting therefrom may be deducted under section 165(a) as\nan ordinary loss. Section 165(g)(3).",

      "content": "Section 165(g)(3). In establishing that section 332 does not apply to the\nliquidation of a subsidiary, a taxpayer must establish that the\nentity was insolvent based on a valuation of all the assets of\nthe entity, taking into account balance sheet and off-balance\nsheet assets. Where the business of the entity continues after a\nliquidation, the taxpayer must consider the value of certain\nintangible assets typically associated with an ongoing business,\nsuch as going concern value and goodwill. Where a shareholder owns common and preferred shares of a\nliquidating corporation, section 332 applies only where the\nshareholder receives property in exchange for its common stock. Commissioner v. Spaulding Bakeries, 252 F.2d 693 (2nd Cir. 1958),\naff\u2019g, 27 T.C. 684 (1957) and H.K. Porter Company Inc. and\nSubsidiaries, 87 T.C. 689 (1986). In Commissioner v. Spaulding Bakeries, 252 F.2d 693 (2nd\nCir. 1958), aff\u2019g, 27 T.C. 684 (1957), the petitioner held common\nand preferred shares of stock of a wholly owned subsidiary\n(\u201cHazelton\u201d). The subsidiary dissolved and the assets were\ntransferred to the taxpayer in the liquidation. The fair market\nvalue of the corporation\u2019s assets satisfied only the taxpayer\u2019s\ninvestment in the preferred stock. There was no value remaining\nto cover taxpayer\u2019s investment in the common shares. In arguing that the taxpayer received property in exchange\nfor its common stock, the Service reasoned that the common shares\nand the preferred shares should be grouped together. Therefore,\nsince property was received in liquidation, section\n4 In a liquidation the assets are first distributed to satisfy\nthe claims of creditors. Therefore, where there is insufficient\nassets to satisfy all the claims of creditors (resulting in\ninsolvency), there is no property to distribute with respect to\nequity holders. 112(b)(6)(predecessor of section 332) applied in denying the\nrecognition of a loss on the liquidation. In disagreeing with the Service, the Tax Court analyzed what\nwas meant by the phrase \u201cin complete cancellation or redemption\nof all its [parent\u2019s] stock\u201d in section 112(b)(6). The Court\nheld that the phrase did not include nonvoting stock which is\nlimited and preferred as to dividends. Spaulding Bakeries, 27\nT.C. at 688. The Court held that since no property was received\nfor the common stock, section 112(b)(6) did not apply with\nrespect to the common stock and, therefore, taxpayer was entitled\nto a loss with respect to its investment in the common shares. In affirming the Tax Court, the Second Circuit stated that\n\u201c[o]n dissolution of Hazelton, the respective priorities of\nindebtedness over preferred and common stock and of preferred\nstock over common stock must be given full force and effect.\u201d Spaulding Bakeries, 252 F.2d at 697. The Court pointed out that\n\u201c[s]ection 112(b)(6)(C) requires for its application a\ndistribution in complete cancellation or redemption of all stock\nof the dissolved corporation\u201d. Id.\nIn H.K. Porter Company Inc. and Subsidiaries, 87 T.C. 689\n(1986), the petitioner held two classes of stock in a corporation\n(Porter Australia) which liquidated. The value of the assets of\nthe corporation was not enough to cover petitioner\u2019s entire\ninvestment in the preferred shares. Since there was no value\ndistributed with respect to the common shares, petitioner argued\nthat section 332 did not apply with respect to the common shares\nand it was entitled to a loss pursuant to section 165(g).",

Respondent argued that section 332 applied to the\nliquidation and no loss was allowed with respect to the\ninvestment in the common shares. Respondent advanced two\narguments: 1) Spaulding Bakeries was erroneously decided and the\ndecision should be reconsidered; and 2) even under the rationale\nof Spaulding Bakeries, section 332 applies. H.K. Porter Company,\nInc., 87 T.C. at 693. The Tax Court rejected Respondent\u2019s argument that Spaulding\nBakeries was erroneously decided. The Court agreed with the\nSecond Circuit\u2019s focus in Spaulding Bakeries on the importance of\npriorities on dissolution. Id. at 694. The Court reasoned that\nsince the assets are distributed first to the preferred stock,\nand there was no property left for distribution to the common\nstock, the distribution was not a distribution with respect to\nall of the subsidiary\u2019s stock. Id. Therefore, section 332 did\nnot apply on the liquidation with respect to the common stock. In H.K. Porter Company, Respondent made two arguments to\nsupport its position that section 332 applied even under the\nreasoning of Spaulding Bakeries: 1) the preferred stock had\nvoting rights and, therefore, the distribution in the present\ncase cannot be considered \u201cimmaterial\u201d, and 2) substance prevails\nover form and, here, petitioner in substance held only one class\nof stock. Id. at 696. The Court refused to focus on the voting rights of the\npreferred stock. Instead, the Court focused on the liquidation\npreference of the stock and held that since no property was left\nfor distribution with respect to the common shares, section 332\nis inapplicable. Id. The Court also rejected Respondent\u2019s\nsubstance-over-form argument. Respondent argued that the\nsubstance of the transaction indicates that petitioner had only\none class of stock, since the preferred stock did not grant\npetitioner any benefits or privileges that it did not already\npossess as the only stockholder in the corporation. Id. at 697. In rejecting Respondent\u2019s argument, the Court focused on the\nfact that the preferred stock was issued approximately 10 years\nbefore Porter Australia was liquidated. The Court concluded that\nthe preferred stock \u201cwas not illusory or part of a financial\nfacade constructed of shuffled papers.\u201d Id. The Court discussed\nthat intercompany loans were capitalized into the preferred\nshares which carried specific rights and privileges. B. Analysis In our case, taxpayer produced a valuation report indicating\nthat -----and ----were insolvent after taking into account the\noutstanding loans from the taxpayer. The report valued the\nentities as ongoing concerns taking into account all tangible and\nintangible assets of the businesses. Therefore, taxpayer argues\nthat section 332 did not apply on the liquidations and it is\nentitled to worthless stock losses pursuant to section 165(g)\nwith respect to its stock in ---- and --. In addition, taxpayer\nargues that it is entitled to bad debt losses for the portion of\nthe loans not satisfied in liquidation (excess of outstanding\nloans over the value of the assets). The audit team has challenged taxpayer\u2019s position that ---and ----were insolvent at the time of the deemed liquidations.

Taxpayer argues that since the\nreclassified debt is treated as preferred stock, section 332 does\nnot apply with respect to the common stock pursuant to\nCommissioner v.

As discussed above, in a liquidation assets are deemed\ndistributed first with respect to debt, then with respect to\npreferred stock and finally with respect to common stock. Therefore, in our case, if the intercompany debt is treated as\npreferred stock (in total or part), then the assets of ------------ and ---are treated as distributed first with respect to the\npreferred stock and then with respect to the common stock. Pursuant to Spaulding Bakeries and H.K. Porter Company, if there\nis no property remaining for distribution on the common stock\nafter the preferred, then section 332 does not apply with respect\nto the common shares. Where the investment in the preferred\nstock is only partially satisfied, section 331 would apply\nresulting in a capital loss for the portion of the investment not\nrecaptured. 5 On the other hand, if the intercompany loans are treated as\ncommon stock and there are no other loans outstanding, then the\nassets of -----and ----would be deemed distributed with respect\nto the common stock on the liquidation.

In determining the true substance of an intercompany advance,\nthe legal rights and obligations of the parties must be\nconsidered. See Fin Hay Realty Co. v.

In our facts, the advances to ----and ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------were made in exchange for\npromissory notes which provided a fixed rate of interest. Although the advances may contain more characteristics of equity\nthan debt6, the terms of the notes must be respected if the notes\nare properly executed and enforceable under local law. In cases under subchapter S of the Code, courts have\naddressed whether intercompany debt reclassified as equity\nconstitutes a second class of stock; thereby, resulting in the\ninability to elect subchapter S treatment. See Gamman v.\nCommissioner, 46 T.C. 1 (1966); Portage Plastics Company, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 470 F.2d 308 (7th Cir. 1972). Section 1362(a)\nprovides that a \u201csmall business corporation\u201d may elect to be\ntreated as an S corporation. In order to constitute a \u201csmall\nbusiness corporation\u201d, a corporation cannot have more than one\nclass of stock. Section 1361(b). In Gamman, the Service reclassified as equity intercompany\nloans made by the shareholder to its wholly owned subsidiary. The Court held that the reclassified debt did not constitute a\nsecond class of stock since it did not give the shareholder any\nadditional rights and interests in the income and assets of the\ncorporation. Although Gamman addresses the issue in our case,\ni.e., whether intercompany debt reclassified as equity\nconstitutes a second class of stock, the holding in Gamman has no\napplication since it is a decision under subchapter S of the code\nand was decided by taking into account the legislative history\nand purpose of subchapter S. 6 We are not offering an opinion of whether the advances should\nbe classified as equity. For purposes of this discussion we\nassume that the facts support the position that all or a portion\nof the intercompany debt should be treated as equity. As discussed above, in H.K.Porter Company, the Court\nrejected respondent\u2019s argument that the preferred stock should be\ntreated as common stock. The Court disagreed with respondent\u2019s\nassertion that the preferred stock did not provide the\nshareholder with any additional rights as to the profit and\nassets of the company. The court cited the fact that the\npreferred stock was in existence for 10 years in rejecting\nrespondent\u2019s substance over form argument. In our case, unlike H.K. Porter Company, neither ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- nor ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- had any preferred stock\noutstanding at the time of the deemed liquidations. However,\nlike the preferred stock in H.K. Porter Company, the promissory\nnotes issued by ---- and -- were in existence prior to the year\nof the liquidation. 7 Where the Service reclassifies debt as\nequity, the terms of any legally enforceable promissory notes\nmust be respected in determining the rights attached to the\nequity interest. If the promissory notes in our case are\nproperly executed and enforceable, taxpayer must be treated as\nholding a class of stock which has a preference to the earnings\nand assets of ---- and --.",
