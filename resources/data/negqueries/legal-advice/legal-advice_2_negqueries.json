This\nadvice may not be used or cited as precedent. Taxpayer = ------------------------------------Year 1\n= ------Year 2\n= ------ISSUE Whether Taxpayer, a manufacturer using the Inventory Price Index Computation\ninventory method, may properly determine its gross profit margin (to convert its selected\nBLS indexes to cost price indexes) using data from a selected month rather than data\nfrom the entire year. CONCLUSION Taxpayer may not determine its gross profit margin by reference to a selected month\u2019s\ndata for purposes of converting its BLS indexes to cost price indexes. Rather, in\naccordance with Rev. Proc. 84-57, the taxpayer is required to determine its gross profit\nmargin by reference to the entire year\u2019s data. POSTF-134426-04 2 FACTS\nTaxpayer is a manufacturer using the Inventory Price Index Computation (IPIC) Method\nto value its last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventories. In Year 2, Taxpayer elected to change\nfrom computing internal annual price indexes under the dollar-value LIFO method to\nusing the IPIC method of computing annual price indexes. As part of the computation of\nthe annual LIFO index for the Year 2 tax year, Taxpayer was required to convert\nindexes selected from the PPI Detailed Report into cost price indexes. In order to make\nthe conversion, the taxpayer computed the cost complement (one minus the gross\nmargin) for December, Year 1 and multiplied that percentage by the selected IPIC price\nindex for December, Year 1. Taxpayer made a similar computation using its cost\ncomplement and the IPIC price index for December, Year 2. Taxpayer then divided the\nproduct of the Year 2 computation by the product of the Year 1 computation and used\nthe quotient as the inventory price index for that category of goods. A simple example of the taxpayer\u2019s computation, using the cost complement computed\nfor the month of December, Year 1 and the month of December, Year 2 is as follows:\nIPIC Category\n0011223344 Year 1 Index\n100.0 DecYr 1 CC\n0.6000 Year 2 Index\n105.0 DecYr 2 CC\n0.7000 Index\n1.2250 A simple example of the taxpayer\u2019s computation, using the cost complement computed\nfor the entire Year 1 and Year 2 years is as follows:\nIPIC Category\n0011223344 Year 1 Index\n100.0 Year 1 CC\n.7000 Year 2 Index\n105.0 Year 2 CC\n0.7200 Index\n1.080 LAW\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.471-8 provides: (a) Retail merchants who employ what is known as the\n\u201cretail method\u201d of pricing inventories may make their returns upon that method, provided\nthat the use of such method is designated upon the return, that accurate accounts are\nkept, and that such method is consistently adhered to unless a change is authorized by\nthe Commissioner as provided in paragraph (e) of \u00a71.446-1.",

An inventory price index computed\nas provided by section 1.472-8(e)(3) is computed with reference to the consumer or\nproducer price indexes for specific categories of inventory items in the CPI Detailed\nReport or Producer Prices and Price Indexes published by the United States Bureau of\nLabor Statistics. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.472-8(e)(3)(iii)(C) in effect for years prior to 2001 provides: Other\nselection requirements. Manufacturers, processors, wholesalers, jobbers, and\ndistributors may select indexes from only Producer Prices and Price Indexes. Retailers\nmay select indexes from either the CPI Detailed Report or Producer Prices and Price\nIndexes, but if equally appropriate indexes could be selected from either publication, a\nretailer using the retail inventory method must select the index from the CPI Detailed\nReport and a retailer not using the retail inventory method must select the index from\nProducer Prices and Price Indexes. If a retailer using the retail inventory method\nselects a price index from Producer Prices and Price Indexes, the selected index must\nbe converted into a retail price index. If a retailer not using the retail inventory method\nselects an index from the CPI Detailed Report, the selected index must be converted\ninto a cost price index. Manufacturers, processors, wholesalers, jobbers, and\ndistributors, must convert selected indexes into cost price indexes.

(Emphasis added)\nSection 3.02 of Revenue Procedure 84-57, 1984-2 CB 496, provides:\n1. If a retailer not using the retail inventory method selects an index from\nthe CPI Detailed Report, the selected index must be converted into a cost POSTF-134426-04 4 price index because the CPI Detailed Report measures changes in retail\nprices, not changes in wholesale or cost prices. Cost price indexes may\nbe derived from indexes selected from the CPI Detailed Report by\nreference to the changes in the cost complements of the gross profit\nmargins of an individual index category. The difference between the movements of wholesale (or cost) and retail\nprices for any given year must be reflected in a change in the markon\npercentage because cost and retail prices would necessarily change by\nthe same relative amount if the markon were uniform. The change in the\nnet markon percentage, or its complement, the cost percentage, may,\ntherefore, be used to derive a cost index from a retail price index for a\ngiven department. Nevertheless, a retailer not using the retail method\ndoes not ordinarily compute the net markon percentages for its respective\ndepartments, for this is a tool of the retail inventory method. It does,\nhowever, compute its gross profit percentages for its respective\ndepartments using essentially the same quantity.

(Emphasis added)\n2. If a retailer using the retail inventory method selects a price index from\nthe Producer Prices and Price Indexes, the selected index must be\nconverted into a retail price index. Retail price indexes may be derived\nfrom indexes selected from the Producer Price and Price Indexes by\nreference to the changes in the cost complements of the gross margins of\nan individual index category in the same manner as cost price indexes are\nderived in section 3.03 1. POSTF-134426-04 5 ANALYSIS The regulations in effect during the years at issue required manufacturers and certain\nretailers using the dollar-value LIFO method and the IPIC computation method\ndescribed in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.472-8(e)(3) to convert selected BLS indexes into cost price\nindexes before determining the LIFO value of their dollar-value pools. This conversion\nis necessary because indexes for LIFO purposes are based on the increases in cost,\nwhereas BLS indexes are based on the prices at which items are sold. Specifically, the\nCPI Detailed Report is based on retail sales prices and the PPI Detailed Report is\nbased on manufacturers\u2019 sales prices. Former Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.472-8(e)(3)(iii)(C) requires manufacturers and certain retailers\nto convert selected BLS indexes to cost price indexes before the indexes are used to\ndetermine the LIFO value of the inventory. In Rev. Proc. 84-57, the Service\ndemonstrated how IPIC method taxpayers must convert their BLS indexes to cost price\nindexes. Specifically, section 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 84-57, requires taxpayers to convert\nthe BLS indexes to cost price indexes using the gross profit percentage \u201cdetermined by\nthe taxpayer for each index category on the basis of its own average for the tax year.\u201d The taxpayer contends it is not required to determine the gross margin based on the\nentire year\u2019s data because Rev. Proc. 84-57 illustrates this requirement by use of a\nretailer, not a manufacturer. The taxpayer misinterprets Rev. Proc. 84-57. Although\nRev. Proc. 84-57 illustrates the requirement that an entire year\u2019s data be used to\nconvert from BLS indexes to cost price indexes using a retailer, its requirements are\nequally applicable to manufacturers. Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 84-57 states that the purpose of the revenue procedure was to\n\u201cprovide guidance to taxpayers that elect to use the dollar-value last-in, first-out (LIFO)\ninventory method and the inventory price index computation method described in\nsection 1.472-8(e)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations.\u201d Consequently, the principles\noutlined in Rev. Proc. 84-57 apply to retailers and manufacturers alike. The example involves a retailer that does not use the retail method but that selects\nindexes from the CPI Detailed Report. If this hypothetical retailer used the retail\ninventory method, it would not be required to adjust the CPI indexes because those\nindexes measure inflation in retail selling prices and the retail inventory method is a\nretail selling price-based inventory valuation method.",

      "content": "If this hypothetical retailer used the retail\ninventory method, it would not be required to adjust the CPI indexes because those\nindexes measure inflation in retail selling prices and the retail inventory method is a\nretail selling price-based inventory valuation method. Similarly, if the retailer selected\nindexes from the PPI Detailed Report, it would not have to adjust the indexes because\nits inventory method is cost-based and the PPI indexes reflect a retailer\u2019s cost of\ninventory. The retailer in the example is required to adjust the CPI indexes because it\nuses a cost-based inventory and the CPI indexes are based on retail sales prices. A manufacturer using the IPIC method is in much the same situation as the retailer that\ndoes not use the retail inventory method but selects indexes from the CPI Detailed\nReport. Manufacturers use cost-based inventory methods and must select indexes POSTF-134426-04 6 from the PPI Detailed Report. Indexes in the PPI Detailed Report reflect manufacturers\u2019\nselling prices. Thus, the manufacturer must adjust the PPI indexes to cost-price\nindexes. Since the purpose of the index conversion is the same for manufacturers as it is for the\nretailer in the Rev. Proc. 84-57 example, the procedure for converting the indexes\nshould also be the same. Moreover, if the Service intended to permit manufacturers to\nconvert their selected BLS indexes to cost price indexes under a method different than\nthat required of retailers, the revenue procedure either would have included a statement\nthat manufacturers can use alternative methods of converting selected indexes or\nincluded a separate example for manufacturers illustrating an alternative method. Given the stated purpose of the revenue procedure and the fact it does not provide a\nseparate example for manufacturers, it is clear that manufacturers and retailers are\nrequired to convert their BLS indexes under the same procedures. Outside the IPIC method context, the Service has consistently held that taxpayers\nrequired to convert BLS indexes to cost price indexes must do so by reference to an\nentire year\u2019s data. See Rev. Rul 54-49. In fact, there is no instance in which published\nguidance permits a taxpayer to convert external LIFO indexes to cost price using less\nthan an entire year\u2019s inventory data. Finally, the conversion from BLS indexes to cost price indexes is not the only time\ntaxpayers are required to use an entire year\u2019s data when selling price-based data to\ncost price-based data. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.471-8 describes the retail method and requires\na retail merchant to determine cost by application of the cost complement. Consistent\nwith the requirements of Rev. Rul. 54-49 and Rev. Proc. 84-57, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.471-8\nrequires the cost complement be determined by reference to an entire year\u2019s data. Under the retail method, taxpayers are required to determine the ratio of cost of\npurchases during the year plus the cost of the beginning inventory to the total selling\nprice of the purchases during the year. This ratio establishes a relationship between the\nselling price and actual cost and enables the retail taxpayer to determine the cost of its\nending inventory by applying the ratio to the retail value of the ending inventory.",
