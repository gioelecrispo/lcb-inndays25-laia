Taxpayer filed a protest on May 31, 2012 (\u201cthe Protest\u201d). EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Taxpayer (\u201cTaxpayer\u201d), a nonresident alien was a partner in Partnership\n(\u201cPartnership\u201d). Partnership develops and markets consumer products including\nthe popular Product. Partnership is headquartered in State, where strategic\ndirection, inventory, distribution and marketing decisions are handled. In Date 1,\nTaxpayer sold her Percentage Amount 1 interest in Partnership for a promissory\nnote in the amount of $Amount 1 to another partner who already owned a\nPercentage Amount 2 interest in Partnership. Prior to Year 1, Taxpayer filed US\nnonresident individual income tax returns (Form 1040 NR), taking into account\npartnership income/loss from Partnership. Taxpayer did not file a return in Year\n1 when she disposed of her interest in Partnership, and has not filed returns in\nthe years thereafter. In the Notice, Exam determined the taxpayer\u2019s gain from the sale of her\npartnership interest constituted effectively connected income (ECI), pursuant to\nRev. Rul. 91-32. In the revenue ruling, the Service determined that: Gain or loss\nof a foreign partner that disposes of its interest in a partnership that is engaged in\na trade or business through a fixed place of business in the United States will be\nUnited States source ECI gain or will be ECI loss that is allocable to United\nStates source ECI gain, to the extent that the partner's distributive share of\nunrealized gain or loss of the partnership would be attributable to ECI (United\nStates source) property of the partnership. The sales agreement and promissory note provide that no principal payment is\nrequired prior to the maturity date of Date 2. Thus, under the installment sales POSTF 117273-12 3 rules, the tax is deferred until that date. While the tax on the sale of the\npartnership interest is deferred until Year 2, the taxpayer must pay the interest\neach year on the deferred tax in accordance with \u00a7453A(a)(1).",

While the tax on the sale of the\npartnership interest is deferred until Year 2, the taxpayer must pay the interest\neach year on the deferred tax in accordance with \u00a7453A(a)(1). Taxpayer disagrees with the proposed adjustment on the following grounds:\n(1) Taxpayer \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the approach taken in Rev. Rul. 91-32\nand argues that under \u00a7741, the sale of a partnership interest is treated as\nthe sale of a capital asset. Capital gains are not taxable under\n\u00a7 871(a)(2), unless an alien is present in the United States 183 days or\nmore. Taxpayer, a nonresident alien, was never present in the United\nStates for 183 days or more, therefore, any capital gain derived from the\nsale of her partnership interest is not taxable to her. Taxpayer further\nargues even if the Revenue Ruling is correct, the 183 day rule still applies,\nand since Taxpayer was never present in the United States for more than\n183 days, she is not subject to any tax on the sale of her partnership\ninterest. (2) Subchapter N provides no authority to apply Section 453A to a\nnonresident alien. Taxpayer\u2019s arguments were previously addressed in the Notice. Taxpayer raises\nno new arguments in her protest of May 31, 2012. In the instant rebuttal, Exam\nreiterates its previous responses to taxpayer\u2019s arguments, and again rejects\nTaxpayer\u2019s positions. DISCUSSION Taxpayer argues that under \u00a7741, the sale of her partnership interest\nconstitutes a capital sale and is not taxable in the US as she was never\npresent in the United States for 183 days of more as required by\n\u00a7871(a)(2). Exam rejects Taxpayer\u2019s argument that Taxpayer\u2019s capital\ngain is not considered ECI and therefore is not subject to US Tax. Taxpayer is correct that \u00a7 741 provides that a gain or loss shall be\nrecognized by the transferor partner and be considered as gain or loss\nfrom the sale or exchange of a capital asset. However, taxpayer fails to\ntake into account that, as articulated in Rev. Rul. 91-32, \u00a7864(c)(2)\nprovides that certain gains or losses from sources within the U.S. from\nthe sale or exchange of capital assets are gains effectively connected\nwith the conduct of a U.S. trade or business or losses that are allocable\nto ECI gain. The starting point for determining whether gain from the sale of property is POSTF 117273-12 4 effectively connected income (ECI) is whether the taxpayer is engaged in a US\ntrade or business. Section 875(1) clearly states that \u201ca nonresident alien\nindividual or foreign corporation shall be considered as being engaged in a trade\nor business within the United States if the partnership of which such individual or\ncorporation is a member is so engaged.\u201d In this case, there is no dispute that\nPartnership, a U.S. partnership, was actively engaged in a trade or business in\nthe U.S. By virtue of her interest in the partnership, the Taxpayer is considered\nto be engaged in a trade or business through the partnership\u2019s fixed place of\nbusiness in the U.S. Moreover, the U.S. trade or business activity of the U.S.\npartnership flows through to Taxpayer.",

      "content": "By virtue of her interest in the partnership, the Taxpayer is considered\nto be engaged in a trade or business through the partnership\u2019s fixed place of\nbusiness in the U.S. Moreover, the U.S. trade or business activity of the U.S.\npartnership flows through to Taxpayer. Rev. Rul. 91-32 holds that because the value of the U.S. trade or business\nactivity of the partnership affects the value of the foreign partner\u2019s interest in the\npartnership, an interest in the partnership that is engaged in a trade or business\nthrough a fixed place of business in the United States is an ECI asset of the\nforeign partner under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.864-4(c)(2) (the asset-use test). Further,\ntaking into account the blend of aggregate and entity concepts under Subchapter\nK of the Code, the rules governing the sale of partnership interests should be\ninterpreted in light of the purposes and policies of I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 864(c) and 865(e). As such, Rev. Rul. 91-32 concludes that gain from the sale of partnership interest\nis treated as gain from the sale of the partner\u2019s proportionate share of the\nunderlying assets of the partnership. Thus, Taxpayer\u2019s sale of an interest in a\npartnership that engaged in a U.S. trade or business, results in U.S. source gain\neffectively connected with that trade or business. Taxpayer offers nothing further than the simple statement that she \u201cstrongly\ndisagrees\u201d with the \u201caggregate approach\u201d taken by the Rev. Rul. 91-32. The\nreasoning of the revenue ruling is consistent with current law and is applicable to\nthe facts of the instant case, as discussed in the Notice and in this rebuttal to the\nprotest. Taxpayer\u2019s position (which is because \u00a7741 generally treats the gain or\nloss from sale of a partnership interest as that of a capital asset, the gain\nrecognized by a nonresident alien must be foreign source) is not supported by\nthe Internal Revenue Code, the revenue ruling, or court cases. Accordingly, the\nadjustments in the Notice should be sustained. The 183 day or more rule of \u00a7871(a)(2) is not applicable to ECI. Exam rejects Taxpayer\u2019s argument that she needs to be present in the US for\n183 days or more to be taxed on her ECI. Section 871(b)(1) provides for the\ngeneral imposition of tax on a nonresident alien\u2019s income effectively connected\nwith a U.S. trade or business as follows: \u201c[a] nonresident alien individual engaged\nin trade or business within the United States during the taxable year shall be\ntaxable as provided in section 1 or 55 on his taxable income which is effectively\nconnected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.\u201d The\nimposition of tax by \u00a7871(b) on a nonresident alien\u2019s effectively connected POSTF 117273-12 5 income with a U.S. trade or business is not dependant upon the nonresident\nalien\u2019s presence in the US in excess of 183 days. When a nonresident alien has\nECI from a US trade or business, that nonresident alien\u2019s ECI is taxed similarly to\nthe income of any of US citizen. Taxpayer\u2019s argument, that a \u201cnonresident alien\u2019s ownership of a partnership\ninterest that conducts business in the US is similar to the ownership of stock in a\nUS corporation\u201d, is without merit.",

A partnership interest cannot be viewed in the\nsame light as corporate stock because a corporation has different characteristics\nfrom a partnership. For example, a corporation is taxed at the corporate level\nand then at the shareholders\u2019 level when the shareholders receive a dividend. On the contrary, a partnership is only taxed once at the partner level. In Unger v.\nCommissioner, 936 F.2d 1316 (D.C. Cir. 1991), aff\u2019g T.C. Memo 1990-15, an\nappellate court upheld the attribution of a U.S. partnership\u2019s office to a foreign\nlimited partner. The court held that the limited partner, a resident of Canada, had\na permanent establishment in the United States by virtue of his interest in the\npartnership offices. Here again, as we have done in the Notice, we emphasize\nthat the imputation rule of \u00a7875 applies and Taxpayer must take into account her\ndistributive share of the items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of\nPartnership. Section 453A is applicable to Taxpayer. As discussed in the rebuttal portion of the Notice, \u00a761(a)(3) provides that gross\nincome means any income from whatever source derived, including gains\nderived from dealings in property. The government has established that the sale\nof Taxpayer\u2019s partnership interest constitutes effectively connected income. Section 1001 provides for the computation of gain or loss from the sale or\ndisposition of property. Section 1001(d) further provides that \u201c[n]othing in this\nsection shall be construed to prevent\u2026the taxation of that portion of any\ninstallment payment representing gain or profit in the year in which such payment\nis received.\u201d The installment method of \u00a7453 is a statutorily prescribed method of accounting\nused for determining taxable income from an installment sale throughout\nSubtitle A1. Thus, the installment method of accounting for taxable income,\nwithin the limitations set forth in \u00a7453, is applicable to the determination of\ntaxable income as referenced in \u00a7871(b). Section 453A is a subset of special\nrules applicable to \u00a7453. If \u00a7453 permits installment reporting in particular\nsituations, \u00a7453A applies in certain instances to limit the benefits of installment\nmethod reporting within certain parameters. The application of the rules in\n\u00a7453A is not limited by Subchapter N in the determination of a nonresident\n1 Both Subchapter E which governs accounting periods and methods of accounting,\nincluding installment sales and Subchapter N relating to taxes on nonresident alien\nindividuals are contained in Subtitle A: \u201cIncome Taxes.\u201d POSTF 117273-12 6 alien\u2019s taxable income. Furthermore, \u00a7864(c)(6) ensures that in the case of any income or gain of a\nnonresident alien individual which is taken into account for any taxable year, but\nis attributable to a sale or exchange of property or any other transaction in any\nother taxable year, the determination of whether such income or gain is taxable\nunder \u00a7871(b) shall be made as if such income or gain were taken into account\nin such other taxable year and without regard to the requirement that the\ntaxpayer be engaged in a U.S. trade or business during the taxable year in which\nthe income is actually taken into account.",

      "content": "Paragraph III of the Protocol to the\nU.S.-India income tax treaty incorporates this principle and states that any\nincome attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment (PE) during its existence\nis taxable in the United States even if the payments are deferred until after the\nPE has ceased to exist. Thus, if payments that would be ECI and attributable to\na U.S. PE in one year are deferred until a later year when the nonresident alien\nwas not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, or had no U.S. PE, the payments\nwould nevertheless be taxed as if they were ECI and attributable to a U.S. PE. Government\u2019s Position: In summary, Exam disagrees with the arguments made by Taxpayer in the\nProtest. The gain on Taxpayer\u2019s complete sale of her interest in Partnership,\n$Amount 2, is subject to US individual income taxation pursuant to the\ninstallment sales reporting rules of \u00a7453 which would defer taxation until the tax\nyear in which principal payment is received by Taxpayer in satisfaction of the\ninstallment sale note. In this case, the principal payment is due on or before\nDate 2. However, the application of the rules of \u00a7453A serve to charge interest\non the deferred tax liability associated with Taxpayer\u2019s deferred installment sale\ngain of $Amount 2 in an amount equal to the \u201capplicable percentage\u201d of the\ndeferred tax liability of the installment sale obligation multiplied by the\nunderpayment rate of \u00a76621(a)(2) in effect for the month in which the taxable\nyear ends.",
