On September 14, 2011, a memorandum with the subject line \u201cAttorney Fees Incurred\nto Defend Against Patent Infringement Claims and to Investigate Patents\u201d was issued to\nyou, hereinafter referred to as the September 14, 2011 Memorandum. The September\n14, 2011 Memorandum opined that attorney fees incurred to defend actions for patent\ninfringement pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2) for submitting Abbreviated New Drug\nApplications (ANDAs) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking to market\nand sell generic drugs before the expirations of the listed patents must be capitalized. The September 14, 2011 Memorandum also opined that the investigatory patent\nresearch fees must be capitalized. The questions relative to the cost recovery of the\ncapitalized attorney fees were reserved. This memorandum responds to your request for assistance on the cost recovery of the\ncapitalized attorney fees. This advice may not be used or cited as precedent.

Whether the cost recovery of capitalized attorney fees incurred by Corporation X\nwhen investigating patents and defending against infringement suits to obtain\nFDA-approved ANDA One must be suspended until the ANDA is amortizable\nand, if so, when is an ANDA amortizable. 2. When ANDA infringement litigation settles with the ANDA holder receiving a\nlicense, whether the cost recovery of capitalized attorney fees incurred when\ninvestigating patents and defending against infringement suits should be\ncapitalized to the license obtained in settlement of the ANDA infringement\nlitigation. 3. Whether the annual cost recovery of attorney fees capitalized to ANDAs and\nlicenses are subject to I.R.C. \u00a7 263A. CONCLUSIONS 1. As franchises, FDA-approved ANDAs are amortizable I.R.C. \u00a7 197 intangibles,\nthat are amortizable ratably over a 15-year period beginning on the first day of\nthe month the FDA-approved ANDA is acquired, provided all applicable\nexclusionary periods have expired and provided that the trade or business\nrequirement of \u00a7 197 is met. Section 197 prohibits amortizable \u00a7 197 intangibles\nfrom being depreciated or amortized under any other provision, with treating\nANDA One as a franchise for cost recovery purposes the primary position. Alternately, as government-granted rights within Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)4(d)(5)(i), rights granted pursuant to ANDAs are licenses or other similar\ngovernment-granted rights within the meaning of I.R.C \u00a7 197(d)(1)(D), with the\ncost recovery the same as for franchises. 2. When ANDA infringement litigation settlements result in the plaintiffs granting the\nANDA holders licenses to market and sell the drugs the subject of the ANDAs,\nthe fees incurred to investigate the patents and to defend against the\ninfringement suits would be capitalized to the basis of the licenses and\nsuspended until the licenses are amortizable or depreciable. If the licenses are\nfor the use of \u00a7 197 intangibles, the attorney fees would be recovered pursuant to\n\u00a7 197.",

The annual cost recovery of the attorney fees capitalized to ANDAs and licenses\nare subject to \u00a7 263A. FACTS The facts are the same as set forth in the September 14, 2011 Memorandum. LAW AND ANALYSIS1 The September 14, 2011 Memorandum, in applying the origin of the claim test, opined\nas follows:\nBased on the facts and circumstances of this case it is clear that the\ninfringement litigation originated from Corporation X\u2019s actions to obtain\nassets, FDA-approved ANDAs, which can be sold or used in its trade\nor business until such time, if ever, the FDA withdraws its approval of\nthe ANDAs. . . . Accordingly, the character of the claims is capital\nsince all claims are proximately related to, and have a direct nexus\nwith, Corporation X\u2019s actions to obtain new assets, i.e., FDA-approved\nANDAs with paragraph IV certifications. September 14, 2011 Memorandum, page 37 (footnote omitted). The September 14, 2011 Memorandum also opined that the attorney fees incurred to\ninvestigate the listed patents2 must be capitalized, as follows: The transactions at issue in this case, which generated the fees at\nissue, arose from Corporation X\u2019s filing of ANDAs with paragraph IV\ncertifications to obtain FDA-approved ANDAs allowing Corporation X to\nmarket and sell generic pharmaceuticals in the territory of the United\nStates prior to the expiration of the United States patents for the\nreferenced NDA-approved drugs. Corporation X was pursuing\nobtaining each ANDA as part of one overall transaction for FDA\n1 The September 14, 2011 Memorandum is incorporated herein by reference.

On an ANDA-by-ANDA basis Corporation X was\nseeking to obtain FDA-approved ANDAs by carrying out the series of\nsteps required by the statutory and regulatory regime to obtain\napproval of its ANDAs. The steps included notifying the NDA holders\nand patentees of the filing of an ANDA with a paragraph IV\ncertification, with that certification necessitating outside counsels to\nresearch the patents. Once the NDA holders and patentees filed suit,\nCorporation X had to defend itself to obtain FDA approval of an ANDA\neffective before the expiration of the patents.",

Accordingly, the\nprofessional fees incurred in researching the paragraph IV\ncertifications and infringement litigation defense fees were incurred to\nfacilitate obtaining governmental-granted rights and thus must be\ncapitalized. September 14, 2011 Memorandum, pages 42-43 (emphasis added). In applying the capitalization of intangible regulations, the September 14, 2011\nMemorandum opined that ANDAs fit one or more of the categories of intangibles that\nare treated as created intangibles pursuant to Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d). The\nSeptember 14, 2011 Memorandum further opined that, as created intangibles, ANDAs\nare within Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i) requiring capitalization of amounts paid to a\ngovernment agency to obtain rights granted by that governmental agency, stating as\nfollows:\n[A]n ANDA fits one [or] more of the non-exclusive list of types of\ngovernment-granted rights that are treated as created intangibles,\ne.g., \u201clicense, permit, franchise or other similar right granted by\nthat governmental agency.\u201d September 14, 2011 Memorandum, page 41. The September 14, 2011 Memorandum also opined with respect to Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i) that, while neither the fees to defend against the infringement\nlitigation nor the fees to investigate the patents were paid to the FDA, the attorney fees\n\u201cthat are the subject of this advice must be capitalized because they were incurred to\nfacilitate, directly or indirectly\u201d obtaining ANDAs. September 14, 2011 Memorandum,\npage 44. The September 14, 2011 Memorandum further opined that the attorney fees\nincurred by Corporation X were capitalizable because they were paid to create or\nenhance separate and distinct intangibles and/or to facilitate the creation or\nenhancement of separate and distinct intangibles. 3\n3 ANDAs are within the definition of separate and distinct intangible assets. POSTU-139175-10 5 Accordingly, the September 14, 2011 Memorandum opined that whether the attorney\nfees at issue are incurred to facilitate, directly or indirectly, the creation of a\ngovernment-granted right within Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i) and/or incurred to\ncreate or enhance a separate and distinct intangible pursuant to Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1.263(a)-4(b)(1)(v) and -4(b)(3)(i), or facilitate such, the attorney fees incurred by\nCorporation X that are the subject of the September 14, 2011 Memorandum must be\ncapitalized. COST RECOVERY ISSUES SECTION I. FDA-APPROVED ANDA One\nFor FDA-approved ANDA One, the attorney fees incurred relative to ANDA One should\nbe added to the basis of the ANDA One because the costs were incurred with respect to\nthat ANDA. An amount required to be capitalized by [Treas. Reg.\n\u00a71.263(a)-4] is not currently deductible under section 162. Instead, the amount generally is added to the basis of the\nintangible acquired or created. See section 1012. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(g)(1). All capitalized attorney fees relative to ANDA One would be suspended (along with\nother expenditures for the ANDA that are not within I.R.C. \u00a7 174) until the ANDA is\namortizable or depreciable. A. ANDAs as Franchises ANDAs can be transferred from the sponsor (original applicant) to another, separate\nand apart from a trade or business. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.72(a).

ANDAs are subject to\nprotection under Federal law. For example, when an ANDA holder has 180 days of\nexclusivity, federal law precludes any other generic for the referenced NDA from being\napproved during the period of exclusivity. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)(IV)(2010). An\nentire profitable industry, the generic pharmaceutical industry, has evolved around the\nvalue of the ANDAs. While it would take an expert, the expected stream of income\nfrom each ANDA could be projected and then valued at its net present value. Accordingly, each ANDA is a separate and distinct asset with the professional fees paid\nto enhance or facilitate the creation of these separate and distinct assets capitalized. Treas.

POSTU-139175-10 6 The September 14, 2011 Memorandum pointed out the following as an example to\nillustrate that ANDAs are within the non-exclusive list of types of government-granted\nrights in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i), and are government granted franchises.

Courts have noted that Congress provided an\n\"expansive definition\" of franchise to \u201cinclude\u201d agreements to sell or\ndistribute goods within a specified area, which does not exclude other\nthings otherwise within the meaning of a franchise.

In addition, the identified categories of expenditures that\nmust be capitalized are construed broadly, and not limited by narrow\ntechnical arguments. T.D. 9107, 2004-1 C.B. 447 \u00a7 II. D. Accordingly, POSTU-139175-10 7 FDA-approved ANDAs that allow the marketing and selling of new\ndrugs in the United States are franchises within the meaning of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i). September 14, 2011 Memorandum, page 41, n. 61. The question not addressed in the September 14, 2011 Memorandum is whether, as\nfranchises, ANDAs are amortizable \u00a7 197 intangibles. To determine if ANDAs are amortizable \u00a7 197 intangibles, the first inquiry is whether\nANDAs are \u00a7 197 intangibles and the second inquiry is whether ANDAs are amortizable\n\u00a7 197 intangibles. If ANDAs are amortizable \u00a7 197 intangibles, \u00a7 197 prohibits any\nother depreciation or amortization with respect to the ANDAs. Section 197 allows an amortization deduction for the capitalized\ncosts of an amortizable section 197 intangible and prohibits any\nother depreciation or amortization with respect to that property. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). 1. As Franchises, ANDAs are \u00a7 197 Intangibles I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d) defines what constitutes a \u201csection 197 intangible\u201d and provides\ngenerally, inter alia, that a \u00a7 197 intangible includes any franchise and any license,\npermit, or other right granted by a governmental unit or an agency. The corresponding\nTreasury Regulations elaborate on what a franchise is for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d),\nincluding when a government granted right is a franchise, as follows:\nSection 197 intangibles include any franchise, trademark, or trade\nname. The term franchise has the meaning given in section 1253(b)(1)\nand includes any agreement that provides one of the parties to the\nagreement with the right to distribute, sell, or provide goods, services,\nor facilities, within a specified area\u2026 A license, permit, or other right\ngranted by a governmental unit is a franchise if it otherwise meets the\ndefinition of a franchise. A trademark or trade name includes any\ntrademark or trade name arising under statute or applicable common\nlaw, and any similar right granted by contract. The renewal of a\nfranchise, trademark, or trade name is treated as an acquisition of the\nfranchise, trademark, or trade name. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(10) (emphasis added).

This is the same code section relied upon\nfor the definition of franchise by the \u00a7 263 regulations. 4 As opined in the September 14, 2011 Memorandum, an ANDA granted by the FDA is a\nfranchise for purposes of the Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d) regulations. For the same\nreasons, an ANDA is also a \u00a7 197 intangible. An approved ANDA provides the\napplicant (or current holder)5 a right granted by the FDA to sell specific generic\npharmaceutical products in the territory of the United States, subject to complying with\nthe reporting requirements of the FDA, which are in the nature of quality controls a\nfranchisor would typically have over a franchise. See September 14, 2011\nMemorandum, Addendum A, last 3 pages (reporting, investigatory and production\nrequirements imposed on an ANDA holder). See also Jefferson-Pilot Corp. v.\nCommissioner, 98 T.C. 435 at 443 (1992), aff'd, 995 F.2d 530 (4th Cir. 1993) (FCC\nlicenses are agreements \u201cbetween the Federal Government and the licensee, under\nwhich the licensee agrees to provide the service of radio broadcasting within a specified\narea in exchange for the right to broadcast\u201d) and Jefferson-Pilot Corp. v.

Thus ANDAs satisfy the \u00a7 1253(b)(1) definition\nbecause ANDAs are agreements which provide a taxpayer with the right to distribute\nand sell a specific product (generic pharmaceuticals) within a specific area (the United\nStates). Because the FDA is the governmental unit that approves the right to sell,\nmarket, and distribute drugs subject to ANDAs, an approved ANDA also meets the\ndefinition of a franchise under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(10). Accordingly, for the\nreasons stated above, an FDA-approved ANDA is a \u00a7 197 intangible. 2. As Franchises, ANDAs are Amortizable \u00a7 197 Intangibles I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(1) defines \u201camortizable section 197 intangible,\u201d stating:\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the term \u201camortizable\nsection 197 intangible\u201d means any section 197 intangible\u2014\n(A)\nwhich is acquired by the taxpayer after the date of the\nenactment of this section [August 10, 1993], and 4 Treas.

In finding for the Commissioner, the\nTax Court interpreted the phrase \u201cin connection with the conduct of a trade or business\u201d\nin \u00a7 197(c)(1)(B) as follows: The inclusion of the word \u201cconduct\u201d indicates to us that the intangibles\nmust be used in connection with a business that is being conducted. We find, therefore, that section 197 contains an active trade or\nbusiness requirement similar to the requirement imposed by section\n162. 2011 WL 3875059 at *16 (footnotes omitted). The Broz II Court found that, because the entity holding the FCC license was not\nengaged in an active trade or business, the entity was not entitled to any amortization\ndeductions for the FCC license. Based on the facts of this case, Corporation X was engaged in the trade or business ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- prior to incurring the\nattorney fees at issue in order to market and sell generic drugs. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Further, Corporation X held\nANDA One in connection with the conduct of its trade or business. Thus, unless\notherwise excluded from being an amortizable \u00a7 197 intangible, ANDA One will qualify\nas an amortizable \u00a7 197 intangible. Section 197 excludes certain self-created \u00a7 197 intangibles from the category of\namortizable \u00a7197 intangibles, stating: The term \u201camortizable section 197 intangible\u201d shall not include any\nsection 197 intangible\u2014\n(A)\nwhich is not described in subparagraph (D), (E), or (F)\nof subsection (d)(1), and\n(B)\nwhich is created by the taxpayer. 6 Broz v. Commissioner, 137 T.C. No. 3, 2011 WL 2670569 (July 7, 2011) [Broz I] decided other issues of\nfirst impression. POSTU-139175-10 10 I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(2) (emphasis added). Pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(2), amortizable \u00a7 197 intangibles do include self-created\n\u00a7 197 intangibles within \u00a7 197(d)(1)(D) (relating to licenses, permits or other rights\ngranted by a government unit), \u00a7 197(d)(1)(E) (relating to covenant not to complete) and\n\u00a7 197(d)(1)(F)(relating to franchises, trademarks, and trade names). For example,\ncosts incurred relative to a franchise or a government-granted right are not excepted\nfrom the amortizable \u00a7 197 category because franchises are excepted from the selfcreated exception by I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(F) and government-granted rights are excepted\nfrom the self-created exception by I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(E). Furthermore, it is noteworthy\nthat, although I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(2) does not apply if the intangible is created in connection\nwith a transaction (or a series of transactions) involving the acquisition of assets\nconstituting a trade or business or substantial portion thereof, there was no purchase of\na trade or business by Corporation X in this case. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(e)(2) provides\nthat, in general, \u201c[t]he acquisition of a franchise . . . constitutes the acquisition of a trade\nor business or substantial portion thereof.\u201d However, because Corporation X created,\nrather than acquired, its franchise, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(e)(2) does not impact the\ntreatment of Corporation X\u2019s ANDA One as an amortizable \u00a7 197 intangible. Treas.",

Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(e)(2) does not impact the\ntreatment of Corporation X\u2019s ANDA One as an amortizable \u00a7 197 intangible. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(d)(2) reiterates the statute and clarifies the status of created\nintangibles, stating:\nExcept as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section,\namortizable section 197 intangibles do not include any\nsection 197 intangible created by the taxpayer (a selfcreated intangible). Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197(d)(2)(iii) confirms franchises are not excluded from amortizable\n\u00a7 197 intangibles, citing I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(F). As discussed above, an approved ANDA is a government granted franchise within both\nI.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(F) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(10). The self-created exception only\napplies to any \u00a7 197 intangible NOT described in I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(D), (E), and (F). Therefore, the exception provided in I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(2) is inapplicable to FDA approved\nANDAs. Accordingly, FDA-approved ANDA One is an amortizable \u00a7 197 intangible. 3. As Franchises, FDA-Approved ANDAs\nMust Be Amortized Over a 15-Year Period The Internal Revenue Code (Code) provides a taxpayer shall be entitled to an\namortization deduction with respect to any amortizable \u00a7 197 intangible. \u00a7 197(a). The\nCode also provides that the amount of such deduction shall be determined by\namortizing the adjusted basis of such intangible ratably over the \u201c15-year period\nbeginning with the month in which such intangible was acquired.\u201d Id. See Frontier POSTU-139175-10 11 Chevrolet Company v. Commissioner, 329 F.3d 1131, 1135 (9th Cir. 2003) (an\namortizable \u00a7 197 intangible must use the 15-year period for amortization, not some\nother life that the taxpayer asserts). The Treasury Regulations further elaborate on the computation of the amortization\ndeduction by providing:\n[T]he amortization deduction allowable under section 197(a) is computed\nas follows:\n(i)\nThe basis of an amortizable section 197 intangible is\namortized ratably over the 15-year period beginning on the\nlater of\u2014\n(A)\nThe first day of the month in which the property is\nacquired; or\n(B)\nIn the case of property held in connection with the\nconduct of a trade or business or in an activity\ndescribed in section 212, the first day of the month\nin which the conduct of the trade or business or\nthe activity begins. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(f)(1)(i) (emphasis added). See Broz II, above (the \u00a7 197\nregulations support the determination that a \u00a7 197 intangible cannot be amortized if the\ntrade or business or activity to which it relates has yet to commence). An FDA-approved ANDA is acquired for purposes of \u00a7 197 on the effective date of the\nfinal FDA approval, provided all applicable exclusionary periods have expired, e.g, the\neffective date is not subject to a condition precedent such as the expiration of period of\nexclusivity barring the ANDA holder from immediately commencing the marketing and\nselling of the drugs that are the subject of the ANDA in the United States. 7 ANDAs are\ntreated as acquired on said date because that is the date the holder of an ANDA can\nbegin to market and sell the generic drugs that are the subject of the ANDA in the\nUnited States.

Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(f)(1) to Corporation X, Corporation X\u2019s 15year amortization period for amortizing the attorney fees associated with its FDAapproved ANDA One would begin the first day of the month in which the FDA finally\napproved the ANDA as effective with no exclusionary periods barring the immediate\nmarketing and selling of a drug that is the subject of the ANDA, since that is the later\ndate of when the Corporation X entered into a trade or business or when the\namortizable \u00a7 197 intangible was acquired. 7 See, September 14, 2011 Memorandum, Addendum A (explanations of exclusionary periods and final\napproval as opposed to tentative FDA approval). POSTU-139175-10 B. 12 ANDAs as Other Government-Granted Rights that are Not Franchises The September 14, 2011 Memorandum opined:\nPayments to the FDA (a government agency) to obtain the right to\nmarket and sell a new drug in the United States (obtained via FDA\napproval of a NDA or an ANDA, as addressed in Addendum A) would\nbe within Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i). Specifically, an ANDA fits\none [or] more of the non-exclusive list of types of government-granted\nrights that are treated as created intangibles, e.g., \u201clicense, permit,\nfranchise or other similar right granted by that governmental agency.\u201d September 14, 2011 Memorandum, page 41 (footnote omitted). Thus, ANDAs constitute licenses and other similar government granted rights, with\nfranchises just one of the government granted rights that an ANDA falls within for\npurposes of capitalization pursuant to \u00a7 263. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(d)(2)(iii) and \u00a7 197(c)(2) do not exclude licenses, permits or other\nrights granted by a governmental unit from amortizable \u00a7 197 intangibles. Thus, as\ngovernment granted rights other than franchises, ANDAs are still amortizable \u00a7 197\nintangibles. Accordingly, ANDAs as other government granted rights would be\namortized just as would franchises. However, the government\u2019s primary position for\ncost recovery purposes is that ANDAs are franchises, with treatment as other\ngovernment-granted rights an alternative position for purposes of determining cost\nrecovery issues. SECTION II. ANDA TWO AND ANDA THREE As stated in the facts, Corporation X commenced marketing and selling Drug #3 and\nDrug #4 pursuant to a License Y and a License Z, respectively, not pursuant to FDAapproved ANDAs.- While the infringement litigation was settled, the origin of the claim\ntest applies to settlements. See Anchor Coupling v. United States, 427 F.2d 429, 434\n(7th Cir. 1970) (rejected primary purpose test in favor of the origin of the claim test for\nsettlements). See also Commissioner v. Arrowsmith, 193 F.2d 734 (2nd Cir., aff\u2019d, 344\nU.S. 6 (1952), petition for rehearing denied 344 U.S. 900 (1952) (doctrine of relation\nback). The Anchor Coupling Court stated, in rejecting Anchor Coupling\u2019s arguments similar to\nCorporation X\u2019s primary purpose arguments, as follows:\nFurther, for deductibility to depend upon subjective considerations\nencourages schemes of tax avoidance and, as the Supreme Court POSTU-139175-10 13 noted in Gilmore, can lead to capricious results and a concomitant\nlack of uniformity in the application of our tax laws. Finally, as the\nCourt noted in Woodward, a test based upon taxpayer's purpose in\ndefending or settling litigation would encourage resort to\n\u2018formalisms and artificial distinctions.\u2019 427 F.2d at 433 (emphasis added).",

For Corporation X, the origin of the claim litigated, which gave rise to the attorney fees\nat issue, was to acquire a capital asset for all the reasons stated in the September 14,\n2011 Memorandum. Also, as stated by the Anchor Coupling Court at the close of its\nopinion: The Government offers another argument which we think should be\nmentioned briefly to further buttress the result we have reached. It\nargues that the settlement and release received by Anchor in return\nfor its settlement payment created enforceable rights in Anchor\nwhich constituted the acquisition of a capital asset. We agree that\nthe transaction can also be viewed in this manner. Thus, if Anchor\nhad completed the proposed sale of its assets by accepting\n$4,025,000 and then repurchased its assets for $4,625,000, it can\nhardly be doubted that the $600,000 premium would be included in\nthe new book value of Anchor's assets. The settlement in this case\naccomplished an identical purpose and should be accompanied by\nidentical tax treatment. 427 F.2d at 434 (citation omitted, emphasis added). The litigation that gave rise to Corporation X\u2019s liability to pay the attorney fees at issue\nherein originated in the process of acquiring the right to market and sell generic drugs in\nthe United States, with that fact not changed by the settlement. However, Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.197-2(b)(8) providing that government-granted licenses are \u00a7 197 intangibles does\nnot apply to the settlement licenses because they are not government granted; the\nsettlement licenses are between Corporation X and the plaintiffs in the infringement\nactions. While the licenses may grant Corporation X the right to use patented\nintangibles, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(c)(7) provides that \u201c[s]ection 197 intangibles do not\ninclude any interest (including an interest as a licensee) in a patent \u2026 that is not\nacquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business.\u201d Corporation X did not acquire\nthe settlement licenses as part of the acquisition of a trade or business. However, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(d)(2)(ii)(B) provides (emphasis added):\nContracts for the use of intangibles. A section 197 intangible is not\na self-created intangible to the extent that it results from the entry\ninto (or renewal of) a contract for the use of an existing section 197 POSTU-139175-10 14 intangible. Thus, for example, the exception for self-created\nintangibles does not apply to capitalized costs, such as legal and\nother professional fees, incurred by a licensee in connection with\nthe entry into (or renewal of) a contract for the use of know-how or\nsimilar property. So, to the extent the licenses received in the settlement of the ANDA infringement\nlitigation relative to ANDA Two and in the settlement of the ANDA infringement litigation\nrelative to ANDA Three were for the use of \u00a7 197 intangibles as described in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(11), the fees are still amortizable pursuant to \u00a7 197.",

However, it is\nnot known whether the licenses were for the use of the plaintiffs\u2019 New Drug Applications\n(NDAs), with the generic drugs Corporation X marketed and sold pursuant to the\nlicenses authorized generics,- or merely licenses to use the patents that provided patent\nexclusivity to the branded drugs that Corporation X\u2019s generics mimic. Since Corporation X commenced marketing its generic drugs pursuant to the licenses\nwhen it did not have FDA-approved ANDAs, it is likely the licenses received granted use\nof the plaintiffs\u2019 NDAs. If the licenses were licenses to use NDAs, like ANDAs, the\nrights under the license may be franchises, licenses or similar rights, or contracts for the\nuse of \u00a7 197 intangibles, and as such \u00a7 197 intangibles for some or all the reasons\nANDAs are such.

Thus, Corporation X has failed to substantiate that it is entitled\nto commence cost recovery, or the annual allowable amount of cost recovery, of the\nattorney fees capitalized relative to the Drug #3 and Drug #4 products for any year\nunder consideration. 8 For treatment of licenses within the definition of collaboration agreements, see the Coordinated Issue\nPaper titled \u201cNon Refundable Upfront Fees, Technology Access Fees, Milestone Payments, Royalties\nand Deferred Income under a Collaboration Agreement,\u201d Tax Notes Today, October 18, 2007, 2007 TNT\n204-17 (\u201cCollaboration agreements are agreements for joint research, experimentation or development,\nas well as agreements for the sharing of know-how or patents for the purpose of research,\nexperimentation or development.
