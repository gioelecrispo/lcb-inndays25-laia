Do the facts, as set forth below, support the taxpayers\u2019\ncontention that a synfuel facilities constructed for Corporation\nat the Facility Location were placed in service before July 1,\n1998? Sub-issues of this issue are as follows:\na. Do the facts show that the taxpayers that owned the\nfacilities as of July 1, 1998, were in the trade or business of\nproducing and selling qualified fuel? CC:LM:NR:----Page 7\nb. What additional information will assist in\ndetermining whether the facilities were timely placed in\nservice? 2. Were the facilities placed in service pursuant to a\nbinding written contract in effect as of January 1, 1997? CONCLUSION 1. The facts, as presented, raise serious questions about\nwhether the a synfuel facilities constructed for Corporation at\nthe Facility Location were placed in service before July 1,\n1998. a. The facts are insufficient to show that the\ntaxpayers that owned the facilities as of July 1, 1998, were in\nthe trade or business of producing and selling qualified fuel. b. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2. There appears to be some question as to whether the\ncontract was, in fact, a binding written contract as of January\n1, 1997. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FACTS 1.\nOn or about Execution Date, Corporation entered into\nan agreement with c for the construction of d Facilities. The\nagreements enumerate several types and amounts of equipment for\nthe facilities. The equipment described in the agreement\nrelated to systems that were designed to accomplish the Process. Among other things, the agreement listed e, f, g, and other\nequipment designed for the Process. Additional equipment\nfocused on Subprocess. This plan was described in a Date 1 CC:LM:NR:----Page 8\nreport by a construction/engineering firm, apparently prepared\nfor h. Some time during Timeframe 1, the agreement was assigned to\ni. During Timeframe 2, construction began on a synthetic fuel\nproduction facilities at the Facility Location, near j. This\nsite is owned by k, a subsidiary of l. While Corporation acted\nas the owner of the facilities during construction, at some\npoint, these facilities were transferred to, and owned by\nPartnership A, Partnership B, Partnership C, and Partnership D.\nEach was a State X entity, formed on Date 2. A construction permit was obtained in Month 3. Construction\nbegan at the Facility Location on or about Date 4. Plans called\nfor the construction of a facilities, each projected to cost\napproximately $m. It appears that n of the plants were\nconstructed by i, and the remainder by c. The taxpayers produced several videotapes, labeled with\ndates between Date 5 and Date 6, showing equipment operating at\nthe site. Among the parts of a facility shown to be running\nwere o, p, and q. What was clear was that some of the feedstock\ncoal was run through r. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The videotapes\ndid not show operation of s. No narrative accompanied the\nimages shown on the videotapes, making it difficult to discern\nwhat was being shown. It was not clear from the videotape that\neach of the a facilities was operational.",

No narrative accompanied the\nimages shown on the videotapes, making it difficult to discern\nwhat was being shown. It was not clear from the videotape that\neach of the a facilities was operational. One fact that was evident from the videotapes was the\nemission of t that occurred during operations.

It appears that Corporation never applied for a\npermanent operating permit from the State Y Department. However, a Date 7 memorandum from u, the Chief Operating Officer\nof Corporation, to one of the contractors states, \u201c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.\u201d Other documents raise a question as to whether the facilities\ncomplied with Department permits. The taxpayers provided a affidavits prepared by Consultant,\na consultant from v. These affidavits state that the a\nfacilities were substantially constructed as designed and that\neach facility operated in excess of Duration during the\ninspection, but do not describe the level of review of the\ndesign that Consultant undertook. Consultant\u2019s affidavits also CC:LM:NR:----Page 9\nstate that no mechanical failure was observed during each\nDuration period. Consultant did not opine as to whether any\nfacility was capable of sustained daily operations. The taxpayers also produced many photographs documenting\nconstruction of the facilities during the Timeframe 3 period. The initial photographs show the fabrication of the equipment\noff-site. Later photos show this equipment at the Facility\nLocation. Photographs accompanying a affidavits prepared by\nConsultant show the operation of several parts of the\nfacilities. The photographs included with the Consultant\naffidavits have descriptions of what is shown. Records provided by the taxpayers reflect inconsistent\ninformation concerning the production between Date 5 and Date 6. An affidavit by u states that w tons of synfuel were produced\nbetween Date 5 and Date 6. Spreadsheets showing production\nreflect an aggregate production of w tons of product for this\ntime frame1. u\u2019s affidavit states that the production total was\ndivided equally among the a facilities, but does not make clear\nthat this accurately reflects the actual production at each\nfacility. Other documents state that the material was run\nthrough the facilities n times. This coincides with records\nthat show that k had only delivered x tons of coal by Date 92. One of the contractor\u2019s documents stated that the material was\nused for aa. Finally, other documents indicate that ab tons of\nmaterial was processed, of which amount ac tons were sold to k\nin Month 10. The question of what was sold is discussed below. Additionally, the taxpayers provided the affidavit of ad of\nc. This affidavit states that the facilities were placed in\nservice prior to July 1, 1998, subject to completion of the ae. However, here again, there is no assertion that the facilities\nwere in a state of readiness sufficient to produce qualified\nfuel on a sustained and reliable basis in commercial quantities. More important, as is described below, ae involves equipment\nintegral to the facility. The taxpayers provided copies of n separate certifications\nof completion, containing nearly identical language. Those\nexecuted by c attested to the completeness of af Facilities by\nDate 11, and the other, executed by i, attested to the\n1 2",

After the operation during Month 16, records reflect no\nproduction of any Synthetic Fuel until Date 17. In fact, each\nof the facilities sat idle of production for the vast majority\nof the period after Date 6. Production spreadsheets show that,\nout of the ar days between Date 8 and Date 18, production was\nrecorded on -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------days,\nrespectively. Moreover, some questions are raised concerning CC:LM:NR:----Page 12\nthe amounts of synfuel recorded as having been produced on two\nspecific dates: Date 19 and Date 20. On those facilityproduction days (out of a total of as facility-production days),\nthe amounts of synfuel produced totaled more than at percent of\nthe total production reflected on the spreadsheets. Graphs\nreflecting the production in tons per day, and in tons per hour,\nare attached. The taxpayers submitted documents reflecting sales by\nCorporation to k of the material processed between Date 5 and\nDate 6, and presented these as proof of sales of synthetic fuel\nto an unrelated third-party. However, the shipping documents\nshow this to be au from the Facility Location. Further, other\ndocuments reflect that this material was used for aa, and that k\nconsidered it to be av. Finally, the sales of this material\nwere recorded at the rate of $aw per ton, rather than at the\nrate specified by Agreement A, which called for k or l to buy\nthe synfuel at the rate of ap. While the documents reflect that\nlater sales were computed in this manner, the sale of the\nmaterial produced by Corporation between Date 5 and Date 6 was\nnot so treated. Moreover, as described above, ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Thus, we do not believe that the initial sale\nto k reflects the sale of synfuel, but rather the sale of au. The initial sale of Synthetic Fuel by Corporation to k\nunder the contract rate set forth in Agreement A did not occur\nuntil Date 21, when Corporation sold ax tons. The terms of\nAgreement A essentially provided k with a customer for a minimum\nof ai tons of coal mined by it through Date 15.

Corporation also had a contract for the purchase of coal from,\nand the delivery of synthetic fuel to k. Beyond this,\nCorporation entered into an agreement with az, a k subsidiary to\nmarket its Synthetic Fuel. The taxpayers provided an undated copy of Agreement B\nbetween Corporation and az. This agreement set Date 11 as its\neffective date. It is not known when Agreement B was reached. The earliest dated reference to it was on Date 25 in a cover\nletter from Corporation to i. The terms of Agreement B required az to use its best\nefforts to market the Synthetic Fuel produced by Corporation,\nand ba to third parties. This included identification of, and\ncontacts and meetings with third parties, coordination of bid\nproposals and requests for proposals, participation in the\nnegotiation of sales agreements. The right to set the terms of\nany sales remained with Corporation. In addition, the contract\nwas not exclusive, permitting Corporation to market the\nSynthetic Fuel or ba itself or through other agents. In exchange, az was entitled to bb for the sale of\nSynthetic Fuel or ba to third parties. Agreement B further\nobligated Corporation to use its best efforts to assist az in\nits marketing efforts.

An additional potential issue has arisen based upon\nthe document review. This question deals with whether\nCorporation entered in to a valid binding written contract as of\nDecember 31, 1996, to construct the subject synfuel facilities. It is duly noted that the taxpayers have each received PLRs\nstating that the Execution Date contract is a qualified binding\nwritten contract. Nevertheless, a review of the subject\ncontract discovered that the parties, per the terms of the\ncontract, were not bound until -----------------------------------------------------------------------. To our knowledge, ---------------------------------------------pursuant to this\ncontract until Year. It is also noted that the facility described in the\nagreement for the construction of d Facilities is not the\nfacility ultimately constructed. The main difference is that\nthe contract called for material handling/control components\nwhich would have allowed for the Process. These facilities were\nnever constructed. The contract rights to bc of the Facilities were sold to\nanother taxpayer. Of the remaining Facilities that it\ncontracted for, Corporation had bd constructed. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n1. In general, section 29 provides a credit for the\nproduction of solid synthetic fuel from coal. Section 29(g)(1)\nprovides a tax credit for the sale of qualified fuels that are\nsold through the end of 2007 and produced from a facility that\nwas originally placed in service after December 31, 1992, and CC:LM:NR:----Page 19\nbefore July 1, 1998, pursuant to a binding written contract that\nwas in effect before January 1, 1997. No regulations have been\npromulgated under section 29. Thus, we look to other published\nguidance of the Service and other analogous Code sections to\ninterpret the meaning and scope of that section, in particular\nthe meaning of placed in service. In general, property is placed in service in the taxable\nyear the property is placed in a condition or state of readiness\nand availability for a specifically designed function. See,\nTreas. Reg. sections 1.46-3(d)(1)(ii) and 1.167(a)-11(e)(1)(i). Placed in service is construed as having the same meaning for\npurposes of the investment tax credit under section 46 and\ndepreciation under section 167, in Rev. Proc. 2001-30, 2001-1\nC.B. 1163 and in private letter rulings. Section 1.46-3(d)(2)\nprovides examples of when property is in a condition of\nreadiness and availability. One of those examples is equipment\nthat is acquired for a specifically assigned function and is\noperational but undergoing tests to eliminate any defects.",

      "content": "Section 1.46-3(d)(2)\nprovides examples of when property is in a condition of\nreadiness and availability. One of those examples is equipment\nthat is acquired for a specifically assigned function and is\noperational but undergoing tests to eliminate any defects. See\nalso Rev. Proc. 79-40, 1979-1 C.B. 13, where machinery and\nequipment were placed in service in the year critical tests\n(with appropriate materials) and operational tests were\ncompleted. Several Tax Court cases have held that facilities can be\ndeemed placed in service upon sustained power generation near\nrated capacity. However, a facility that operates on a regular\nbasis but does not produce the projected output may still be\nconsidered placed in service. Sealy Power, Ltd v. Commissioner,\n46 F.3d 382 (5th Cir. 1995), nonacq. 1996-1 C.B. 6. At a\nminimum, a property has to have been in a state of readiness\nsufficient to produce its product on a sustained and reliable\nbasis in commercial quantities to have been placed in service. See Sealy Power, Ltd., AOD 1995-010. And in Rev. Rul. 84-85,\n1984-1 C.B. 10, a solid waste facility that was experiencing\noperational problems such that it was unable to operate at its\nrated capacity was considered to have been placed in service\nsince it was being operated on a regular basis and saleable\nsteam was being produced. But if a facility is merely operating\non a test basis, it is not placed in service until it is\navailable for service on a regular basis. Consumers Power Co.\nv. Commissioner, 89 T.C. 710, 724 (1987). The above-referenced cases and rulings, which address\nelectric generating facilities, provide some parallels in\nevaluating a placed in service issue for section 29 facilities. The following factors are important in determining when a CC:LM:NR:----Page 20\nsynfuel plant is placed in service:\n(1) approval of required licenses and permits;\n(2) passage of control of the facility to taxpayer;\n(3) completion of critical tests; and\n(4) commencement of daily or regular operation. As stated above, the Service found that reaching the design\ncapacity is not a prerequisite to a determination that a\nfacility was placed in service. Rev. Rul. 84-85, 1984-1 C.B.\n103. In that ruling, the Service looked to daily operation of\nthe facility to determine the placed in service date. In Valley\nNatural Fuels v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1991-341, aff\u2019d in\nunpublished opinion, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 6739 (9th Cir. Mar.\n23, 1993), the court required an ethanol plant to be producing\nethanol of the quality for which the plant was designed prior to\nbeing placed in service. Likewise, however, a facility is not placed in service when\nit is merely at an interim stage of construction. Noell v.\nCommissioner, 66 T.C. 718, 729 (1976). Thus, the operation of\nequipment, such as q, prior to -------------------------------------, is an interim construction stage, and not placed in\nservice. The focus in determining a placed in service date should be\non ascertaining from the relevant facts and circumstances the\ndate the unit begins supplying product in such a manner that it\nis routinely available and is consistent with the unit=s design. To do so, one must examine relevant factors occurring both\nbefore and after the claimed placed in service date to verify\nthe commencement of commercial operations.",

However, a facility\ndoes not have to achieve full design output to be placed in\nservice as long as it is in the process of ramping up its\nproduction levels. Subject to exceptions that are beyond the\ntaxpayer=s control, the Service has generally required actual\noperational use as a prerequisite for an asset to be deemed\nplaced in service. For this reason, it is critical to know when\nthe facility began producing synfuel, and whether this\nproduction continued to Aramp-up@ or ceased until significant\nproblems with the facility were corrected. Regarding facilities that are not operating as of the cutoff date, the facilities\u2019 readiness and availability to produce,\non a regular basis, commercial quantities of synfuel are\ncritical to determining whether it has been placed in service. In addition, subsequent production should reflect the same ramp- CC:LM:NR:----Page 21\nup to facility capacity. However, if the facility never\noperates at a significant production level, or in the same or\nnext tax year shuts down for any significant period of time to\ncorrect production problems, the earlier activity is likely in\nthe nature of start-up and testing, and the facility has not\nbeen placed in service. We believe that, based upon the facts as presently known,\nit is questionable whether any of the facilities were placed in\nservice by June 30, 1998. We believe that the facts concerning\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------are critical to this\nanalysis. To the extent that you can further develop these\nareas, it will make clearer the proper determination, and\naddress areas of ambiguity. a. As set forth above, in the absence of regulations\nspecific to section 29, we look to other published guidance of\nthe Service and other analogous Code sections to interpret the\nrequirement that the taxpayers were in the trade or business of\nproducing and selling synthetic fuel at the time that the\nfacilities were placed in service. In general, business operations must have begun for the\nsubject property to be considered placed in service. See,\nPiggly Wiggly Southern, Inc. v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. 739, 748\n(1985), nonacq. on another issue, 1988-2 C.B. 1, aff\u2019d on\nanother issue, 803 F.2d 1572 (11th Cir. 1986). Sporadic\nactivity may be merely start-up activity. The property cannot\nbe placed in service until the trade or business begins. Wall\nv. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1992-321; Richmond Television Corp.\nv. United States, 345 F.2d 901, 909 (4th Cir. 1965), vacated and\nremanded on another issue, 382 U.S. 68 (1965), on remand, 354\nF.2d 410 (4th Cir. 1965), overruled on other grounds. To depreciate property, section 167 requires property to be\nused in a trade or business or for the production of income. However, activities that constitute a trade or business are not\ndefined in the regulations under 167. Similar provisions under\nsection 162 provide guidance. In pertinent part, section 162(a)\nallows as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses\npaid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any\ntrade or business. To qualify as such a deduction, an\nexpenditure must: (1) be paid or incurred during the taxable",

To qualify as such a deduction, an\nexpenditure must: (1) be paid or incurred during the taxable CC:LM:NR:----Page 22\nyear, (2) be for carrying on any trade or business, (3) be an\nexpense, (4) be necessary, and (5) be ordinary. Commissioner v.\nLincoln Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 403 U.S. 345, 352 (1971). The\ninstant issue concerns the interpretation of the second\nrequirement. Neither the Code nor the regulations provide any explicit\ndefinition of the term \u201ccarrying on any trade or business\u201d for\npurposes of section 162. The Supreme Court has stated that to\nbe engaged in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d for purposes of section 162,\nthe taxpayer must be involved in the activity with continuity\nand regularity, and the taxpayer\u2019s primary purpose for engaging\nin the activity must be for income or profit. Commissioner v.\nGroetzinger, 480 U.S. 23, 35 (1987). Determining whether a\ntaxpayer is carrying on a trade or business for purposes of\nsection 162 requires an examination of the facts in each case. 480 U.S. at 36. In Richmond Television Corp., supra, the Fourth Circuit\naddressed the issue of the point in time at which the taxpayer\u2019s\nbusiness began. After reviewing other cases to see the\nevidentiary bases on which factual determinations were made, the\ncourt stated the following rule: \u201c[E]ven though a taxpayer has\nmade a firm decision to enter into business and over a\nconsiderable period of time spent money in preparation for\nentering that business, he still has not \u2018engaged in carrying on\nany trade or business\u2019 within the intendment of section 162(a)\nuntil such time as the business has begun to function as a going\nconcern and performed those activities for which it was\norganized.\u201d 345 F.2d at 907 (footnote omitted). In Jackson v.\nCommissioner, 864 F.2d 1521, 1526 n.7 (10th Cir. 1989), the\ncourt discussed the case of Kennedy v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1973-15, which held that a pharmacy did not begin to function as\na going concern until the date it first opened its doors to the\npublic. The Jackson court explained that, although sales\npresumably followed, this holding properly focused on the\ntaxpayer\u2019s \u201copening its doors\u201d to attempt to make a sale, and\nnot on the taxpayer\u2019s success at selling. We do not find the facts, as developed, as providing\nsufficient basis to allow the credits. It does not appear that\nCorporation or Partnerships A, B, C, and D were engaged in the\ntrade or business of producing and selling Synthetic Fuel as of\nthe cut-off date for purposes of the section 29 credit. None of\nthese entities had an existing business to supply coal or\nsynthetic fuel prior to that time. While the taxpayer presented\nAgreement A, it is not certain when Corporation and k entered CC:LM:NR:----Page 23\ninto that contract. Further, it created no real obligation for\nk to purchase Synthetic Fuel.",
