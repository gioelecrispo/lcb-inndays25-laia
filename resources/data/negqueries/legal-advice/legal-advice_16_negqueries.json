Analysis\n(a) With respect to amortization of investigatory expenses, does\n' 195 apply only to creating a new business or acquiring a\nbusiness in a field that differs from the acquirer\u2019s existing\nbusiness? Under the Internal Revenue Code, investigatory expenses, as\npart of startup expenditures,2 are amortizable over 60 months,\nwhich, compared with capitalization, is more favorable to\ntaxpayers. See I.R.C. ' 195(b). Under \u00a7 195, investigatory expenses refers to any amount(A) paid or incurred in connection with(i) investigating the creation or acquisition\nof an\nactive trade or business,\n... ...\n(B) which, if paid or incurred in connection with the\noperation of an existing active trade or business (in\nthe same field as the trade or business referred to in\nsubparagraph (A)), would be allowable as a deduction\nfor the taxable year in which paid or incurred. I.R.C. ' 195(c)(1). (I.R.C. ' 195(c)(1)(A) and I.R.C.\n' 195(c)(1)(B) hereinafter are sometimes referred to as\nAsubparagraph (A)@ and Asubparagraph (B)@ respectively.) 2 \u00a7 195 addresses startup expenditures, which includes investigatory expenses\nand startup costs. See discussion infra in this Analysis. CC:LM:NR:HOU:2: POSTF 163829-02 page 4 Whether this statute applies to the acquisition of an\nexisting business in the same field as the acquirer\u2019s depends on\nthe meaning of Aactive trade or business@ in subparagraph (A)(i)3. Neither Subparagraph (A) nor (B) defines Aactive trade or\nbusiness.@ These two subparagraphs, however, shed much light on\nthe term\u2019s meaning when looked at together. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) together, in pertinent parts,\nstate that, in addition to \u201cin connection with\u201d investigating the\ncreation or acquisition of an active trade or business, a startup\nexpenditure is an expense that would be currently deductible, if\nit were paid or incurred in connection with the operation of an\nexisting trade or business which is in the same field as that of\nthe one created or acquired. To illustrate, suppose A creates or acquires B, an active\ntrade or business in field X. A\u2019s startup expenditures,\nincluding the expenses incurred in connection with investigating\nthe creation or acquisition of B, must be such that, if incurred\nin connection with the operation of an existing business in field\nX, are currently deductible. Whether an expense is currently deductible is controlled by\nI.R.C. ' 162, which provides that only ordinary and necessary\nexpenses are currently deductible. What kind of expenses, then,\npaid or incurred in connection with investigating the creation or\nacquisition of B could have been incurred in connection with\noperating an existing business in field X and currently\ndeductible? Such expenses are not identifiable, or even\nconceivable, from the plain language of ' 195(c), although such\nidentification is crucial to the ultimate issue in this case. \u201cIn the absence of a legislative definition, the term must\nbe given a meaning consistent with the overall statutory\ncontext.\u201d Doe v.

CC:LM:NR:HOU:2: POSTF 163829-02 page 5 Section 195 was enacted in 1980. The legislative history\nreflects that Congress, in enacting ' 195, intended to encompass\ntwo types of expenses in startup expenditure, i.e. investigatory\nexpenses and startup costs. 4 See 96 H. Rpt. 1278 at 9-10. Congress defined the term \u201cinvestigatory expenses\u201d as Acosts\nof seeking and reviewing prospective businesses prior to reaching\na decision to acquire or enter any business. Business\ninvestigatory expenses may be of either a general or specific\nnature. The former are related either to businesses generally,\nor to a category of business; the latter are related to a\nparticular business.@ Id. at 9 (emphasis added). The word \u201center\u201d in the Congressional definition of\n\u201cinvestigatory expenses\u201d indicates that the target business is\nnew to the taxpayer: either the taxpayer is not engaged in an\nexisting business or is engaged in a business in a different\nfield. Grammatically, \u201cbusiness\u201d is the object of both \u201cacquire\u201d\nand \u201center.\u201d The meaning of the word \u201cbusiness\u201d in this context,\nthen, must be such that fits both verbs. It is therefore logical\nto conclude that the word \u201cbusiness\u201d can only mean a business in\na field different from the acquirer\u2019s. Thus, the Congressional\ndefinition of \u201cinvestigatory expenses\u201d appears to imply that\n\u00a7 195 only applies to acquiring a business in a different field. This implication is more conspicuous when Congress describes\nthe eligibility for amortization under \u00a7 195. To be eligible for\namortization under \u00a7 195, states the House Report, \u201c[f]irst, the\nexpenditures must be paid or incurred in connection with\ncreating, or investigating the creation or acquisition of, a\ntrade or business entered into by the taxpayer.\u201d Id. at 10\n(emphasis added). As already explained, entering into a business\nsuggests that the business is in a different field if the\ntaxpayer is already engaged in an existing business. Here, to be\neligible for amortization of the investigatory expenses under\n\u00a7 195, it is required that the business must be one entered into\nby the taxpayer. In other words, if the taxpayer acquires a\nbusiness, the acquired business must be in a field different from\nthe taxpayer\u2019s existing business. 4 This Analysis will focus only on investigatory expenses because the present\ncase does not involve startup costs. CC:LM:NR:HOU:2: POSTF 163829-02 page 6 This interpretation is consistent with the statutory context\nof \u00a7 195. \u201cInvestigatory expenses\u201d is one of the two categories\nincluded in \u201cstartup expenditures\u201d under \u00a7 195. The word\n\u201cstartup\u201d connotes originality, newness, or distinctiveness from\nwhat already exists. This \u201cnewness\u201d notion is more explicitly\nexpressed in the House Report\u2019s discussion of \u201cstartup costs,\u201d\nthe other category included in \u201cstartup expenditures:\u201d\nGenerally, the term Astartup costs@ refers to expenses\nwhich would be deductible currently if they were\nincurred after the commencement of the particular\nbusiness operation to which they relate. Such costs\nmay be incurred by a party who is not engaged in any\nexisting business, or by a party with an existing\nbusiness who begins a new one that is unrelated, or\nonly tangentially related, to his or her existing\nbusiness.

Id. at 10 (emphasis added). Although Congress did not state that investigatory expenses\nmust be related to acquiring a business in an unrelated or only\ntangentially related field, it can be inferred from the overall\ncontext of \u00a7 195 that Congress did so intend. In Rev. Rul. 99-23, three hypothetical situations are\nestablished to elucidate what qualifies as \u00a7 195 amortizable\ninvestigatory expenses in an acquisition of an existing active\ntrade or business. In each hypothetical situation the target\ncompany is in a field unrelated to the acquirer\u2019s. See Rev. Rul.\n99-23. Incorporating such a fact pattern in each hypothetical\nsituation of the ruling reveals the IRS\u2019s reluctance to extend\n\u00a7 195\u2019s application to acquiring a business in the same field (if\nnot its position that \u00a7 195 only applies to acquiring a business\nin a different filed) with respect to amortizing investigatory\nexpenses. The inquiry might as well end here. But it may still be\nasked whether the definition of investigatory expenses could have\nmeant costs of seeking and reviewing prospective businesses prior to reaching a decision to\n(1) acquire a business either in the same field as the acquirer\u2019s or in a different filed; or (2)\nenter a business in a different field. CC:LM:NR:HOU:2: POSTF 163829-02 page 7 In enacting \u00a7 195, Congress did not contemplate ordinary and\nnecessary business expenses paid or incurred in connection with\nthe expansion of an existing business. Congress noted that these\nexpenses were already deductible under the then existing law. See\nId. at 11. Congress was only concerned with those that were\nordinary and necessary yet could not be deducted under ' 162,\nbecause they were not paid or incurred in carrying on a business. As the House Report notes, these expenses were considered Aas not\nbeing ordinary and necessary trade or business expenses, viz.,\nbecause no business exists, within the meaning of section 162 of\nthe Code.@ 5 Id. at 9 (emphasis added). The above language suggests that Congress contemplated the\nfollowing scenario in enacting ' 195:\nA, engaged in an existing business, incurs \u201ccosts of\nseeking and reviewing prospective businesses prior to\nreaching a decision to acquire\u201d6 B (and later does\nacquire B). But A cannot deduct these expenses,\nbecause they are incurred before B is acquired, so that\nthey are not incurred in carrying on a business. Why are these expenses not considered as incurred in\nconnection with expanding A\u2019s existing business and thus\ndeductible under \u00a7 162? There are two possible answers to this\nquestion:\n(1) B is in a different field as A\u2019s, so that \u201cno business\nexists\u201d for A to deduct the expenses (the effect of acquiring B,\na business in a different field, is the same as entering a new\nbusiness);\n(2) B is in the same field as A\u2019s, but acquiring a business\nin the same field is not considered as expanding the acquirer\u2019s\nexisting business.

See discussion on Page 5 supra. CC:LM:NR:HOU:2: POSTF 163829-02 page 8 (1) the only answer to the question, then it can be concluded\nthat \u00a7 195, with respect to amortizing investigatory expenses,\nonly applies to acquisition of a business in a different field. Is acquiring a business in the same field considered as\nexpanding the acquirer\u2019s existing business? An instinctive\nanswer would be yes (expanding by buying competitors), but it has\nlittle support in either statutory or case law. \u201cExpanding a\nbusiness,\u201d or \u201cbusiness expansion,\u201d is not defined either in the\nCode or in the Regulations. The House Report, as well as \u00a7 195\nitself, indicates that costs of seeking and reviewing prospective\nbusinesses prior to reaching a decision to acquire or enter any\nbusiness (Congressional definition of \u201cinvestigatory expenses\u201d)\nincurred in connection with the expansion of an existing business\nare deductible under \u00a7 162. But no example of such deductible\nexpenses has ever been given. No such incidents have been\nobserved. This category of currently deductible expenses only\nexists as a phantom. In Wells Fargo v. Commissioner, 224 F.3d 874 (2000), the\ntransaction from which the dispute arises is a bank=s acquisition\nof two other banks. Because the banks are in the same field of\nbusiness, the government conceded on brief that the transaction\nis an expansion of an existing business, and, consequently, the\ninvestigatory expenses, instead of amortizable under ' 195, are\ncurrently deductible. See the Government=s Brief for the\nAppellee, Wells Fargo v. Commissioner at Pages 22-23. Since the Court did not hold on this issue, merely\nmentioning it in the opinion, the government\u2019s position has no\nprecedential value. Neither did the government provide any legal\nbasis for this position. The answer to whether acquiring a business in the same field\n(as the acquirer\u2019s) constitutes business expansion has grave\nramifications. To answer this question in the affirmative might\nbe interpreted as recognizing that investigatory expenses\nincurred in connection with acquiring a business in the same\nfield are deductible under \u00a7 162. Inferring any expense\u2019s \u00a7 162 deductibility from\ninterpretation of a different Code section is as undesirable a\nside effect as it is an inappropriate analytical approach. Since\nthere has been no binding precedent on this issue, the government\nhas yet to take a position thereon. This task, however, is CC:LM:NR:HOU:2: POSTF 163829-02 page 9 beyond the authority (and persuading power) of the Chief\nCounsel\u2019s field office. We therefore only conclude, based on the above analysis, to\na reasonable degree of certainty, that with respect to\ninvestigatory expenses amortization, \u00a7 195 applies only to the\ncreation of a new business or acquisition of a business in a\ndifferent field.

I.R.C. ' 263(a). In applying\n' 263, instead of solely looking at the increased value to\nconcrete assets, Courts have focused on the long-term effect that\nexpenditures generate, and maintained that there does not have to\nexist a physical asset for ' 263 to apply.
