If you find that any of the\nfacts are incorrect, please advise us immediately so that we may modify and correct this\nadvice. I. ISSUE\nWhether certain partnerships may designate the ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------as the TMP for the tax year -------? II. FACTS The Service is examining approximately ----- domestic limited liability companies\n(treated as partnerships for Federal tax purposes) involved in a ------------------------ sale\nof -----------------------. The partnerships owned the ------------------------, and at the time of\nthe sale, -------------------- was a general partner and the TMP in each of the\npartnerships. 1 -------------------- passed away in -------------. Upon his death, the majority\n1 Most of the partnerships treated the ------- transaction as a sale of partnership interests (thus resulting in\na technical termination of the partnership), but some of the partnerships treated it as an asset sale. This\ndistinction does not affect the analysis of whether the partnerships may now designate a trust as the\nTMP. POSTSP-107553-10 2 of ----------------- property passed to the ---------------------------------------- (\u201cthe Trust\u201d). ---------------------------------, ----------------, is the trustee of the Trust. The partnerships want to\ndesignate the Trust as the TMP. III. APPLICABLE LAW\nSection 6231(a)(7)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cI.R.C.\u201d) defines the TMP\nas the general partner designated as the TMP as provided in the regulations. Treasury\nRegulation \u00a7 301.6231(a)(7)-1 states that a partnership may designate a partner as its\nTMP for a taxable year only as provided in section 301.6231(a)(7)-1. Further, the\ndesignation of a partner as a TMP for a taxable year may be terminated only as\nprovided in section 301.6231(a)(7)-1. If the designation is terminated without the\npartnership designating another general partner as the TMP, the TMP is the partner\ndetermined under section 301.6231(a)(7)-1. In general, a person may be designated as the TMP of a partnership for a\ntaxable year only if that person: (1) was a general partner in the partnership at some\ntime during the taxable year for which the designation is made; or (2) is a general\npartner in the partnership at the time the designation is made. Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 301.6231(a)(7)-1(b)(1). Section 7701 includes a trust within the definition of a person\nfor purposes of the I.R.C. A designation of a TMP for a taxable year remains in effect until there is a\ntermination of the designation under section 301.6231(a)(7)-1(l). The death of the TMP\nis an event that terminates the TMP\u2019s designation. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6231(a)(7)-1(l)(i).",

The death of the TMP\nis an event that terminates the TMP\u2019s designation. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6231(a)(7)-1(l)(i). If the partnership has designated a TMP for a taxable year, that designation has\nterminated under paragraph (l)(1) of section 301.6231(a)(7)-1, and the partnership has\nnot made a subsequent designation under section 301.6231(a)(7)-1 for that taxable\nyear, the TMP for that taxable year is determined under paragraph (m) of section\n301.6231(a)(7)-1. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6231(a)(7)-1(m)(1). In such a case, and in\ngeneral, the general partner having the largest profits interest is the TMP (unless it is\nimpractical to apply the largest profits interest rule, in which case the Service can select\nthe TMP). Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6231(a)(7)-1(m) & (n).\nSection 301.6231(a)(7)-1(e) & (f) set forth two situations in which a partnership\nmay designate a TMP at any time after the filing of the partnership return for that year. Under paragraph (e) of section 301.6231(a)(7)-1, the partnership may file an\nappropriate statement with the Service, and signed by persons who were general\npartners at the close of the year and were shown on the return for that year to hold\nmore than 50% of the aggregate interest in partnership profits held by all general\npartners as of the close of the taxable year. 2 Second, in certain limited circumstances\n(including the death of the general partner), a TMP for a partnership taxable year may\nbe designated by filing a statement with the Service, and signed by persons who were\n2 Section 301.6231(a)(7)-1(e) & (f) set forth specific criteria that the partnership must follow when making\na designation under these paragraphs. POSTSP-107553-10 3 partners at the close of the taxable year and were shown on the return for that year to\nhold more than 50% of the aggregate interest in partnership profits held by all partners\nas of the close of such taxable year. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6231(a)(7)-1(f). IV. ANALYSIS & CONCLUSION In the present case, the partnerships designated the general partner ------------------------ to be the TMP for -------. This designation terminated on the date of --------------------------- death. The partnerships have not yet made a subsequent designation under\nsection 301.6231(a)(7)-1. The partnerships want to designate the Trust as the TMP. Based upon the facts provided and the applicable law, the partnerships may\ndesignate the Trust as the TMP in accordance with either paragraph (e) or (f) of section\n301.6231(a)(7)-1 provided that, at the time of designation, the Trust is a general partner\nin the each of the partnerships. From the information provided thus far, we are unable\nto provide advice as to whether the Trust is a general partner in each of the\npartnerships. 3 If it can be confirmed that the Trust is a general partner in each of the\npartnerships, in order for a designation under paragraph (e) or (f) of section\n301.6231(a)(7)-1 to be valid, each of the partnership returns for ------- must be secured\nto ensure that the partnerships comply with the technical requirements of these\nparagraphs.",
