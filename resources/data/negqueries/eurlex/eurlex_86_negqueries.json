In 2006, the Community and Georgia agreed on a European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan identifying medium-term priorities in EU-Georgia relations. In 2010, the Union and Georgia launched the negotiations of an Association Agreement that is expected to replace the existing EU-Georgia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (2). The framework of EU-Georgia relations is further enhanced by the newly launched Eastern Partnership. (2) The extraordinary European Council meeting on 1 September 2008 confirmed the Unions willingness to strengthen EU-Georgia relations in the aftermath of the armed conflict in August 2008 between Georgia and the Russian Federation. (3) The Georgian economy has been affected by the international financial crisis since the third quarter of 2008, with declining output, falling fiscal revenues and rising external financing needs. (4) At the International Donors Conference held on 22 October 2008, the international community pledged support to Georgias economic recovery in line with the Joint Needs Assessment carried out by the United Nations and the World Bank. (5) The Union announced that it would provide up to EUR 500 million as financial assistance to Georgia. (6) Georgian economic adjustment and recovery is supported by financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In September 2008, the Georgian authorities agreed with the IMF on a Stand-By Arrangement of USD 750 million to support the Georgian economy in making the necessary adjustments in the light of the financial crisis. (7) Following a further deterioration of Georgias economic situation and a necessary revision of the underlying economic assumptions of the IMF programme as well as Georgias greater external financing needs, an agreement was reached between Georgia and the IMF for a loan increase of USD 424 million under the Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved in August 2009 by the IMF Board. (8) The Union allocated, for 2010-2012, under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), budget support grants to Georgia of, on average, EUR 24 million per year.",

(9) In view of Georgias deteriorating economic situation and outlook, it has requested Union macro-financial assistance. (10) Given that there is still a residual financing gap in Georgias balance of payments, macro-financial assistance is considered an appropriate response to Georgias request under the current exceptional circumstances to support economic stabilisation in conjunction with the current IMF programme. (11) The Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Georgia (the Unions macro-financial assistance) should not merely supplement programmes and resources from the IMF and the World Bank, but should ensure the added value of Union involvement. (12) The Commission should ensure that the Unions macro-financial assistance is legally and substantially in line with the measures taken within the different areas of external action and other relevant Union policies. (13) The specific objectives of the Unions macro-financial assistance should strengthen efficiency, transparency and accountability. Those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission. (14) The conditions underlying the provision of the Unions macro-financial assistance should reflect the key principles and objectives of the Unions policy towards Georgia. (15) In order to ensure efficient protection of the Unions financial interests linked to the Unions macro-financial assistance, it is necessary that Georgia adopt appropriate measures relating to the prevention of, and the fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to that assistance. It is also necessary that the Commission provide for appropriate checks and that the Court of Auditors provide for appropriate audits. (16) The release of the Unions macro-financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority. (17) The Unions macro-financial assistance should be managed by the Commission. In order to ensure that the European Parliament and the Economic and Financial Committee are able to follow the implementation of this Decision, the Commission should regularly inform them of developments relating to the Unions macro-financial assistance and provide them with relevant documents. (18) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commissions exercise of implementing powers (3). (19) In this context, it is recalled that in the terms of that Regulation the advisory procedure should, as a general rule, apply in all cases other than as provided for in that Regulation. Considering the potentially important impact of the operations superior to the threshold of EUR 90 million, it is appropriate that the examination procedure is used for these operations.",

Joint Declaration by the European Parliament and the Council adopted together with the decision providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia The European Parliament and the Council: \u00c2\u201d agree that the adoption of the decision on providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia should be seen in the wider context of the need for a framework that should secure sound and effective decisions on providing macro-financial assistance to third countries; \u00c2\u201d agree that the adoption of decisions on macro-financial assistance operations should be based on the considerations and the principles set out below for the granting of Union macro-financial assistance to eligible third countries and territories, without prejudice to the right of legislative initiative and the legal form that a future instrument formalising these considerations and principles might take; \u00c2\u201d commit to fully reflect these considerations and principles in the future individual decisions on granting the Unionss macro-financial assistance. PART A - CONSIDERATIONS (1) The Union is a major provider of economic, financial and technical assistance to third countries. Union macro-financial assistance (macro-financial assistance) has proved an efficient instrument for economic stabilisation and a driver for structural reforms in countries and territories benefitting from such assistance (beneficiaries). In accordance with its overall policy in respect of candidate, potential candidate, and neighbourhood countries, the Union should be in a position to provide macro-financial assistance to those countries with the aim of developing a zone of shared stability, security, and prosperity. (2) Macro-financial assistance should be based on ad-hoc, country-specific decisions of the European Parliament and of the Council. These principles aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the decision-making process leading to such decisions and their implementation, and to strengthen the application by the beneficiary of the political pre-conditions for granting macro-financial assistance and to improve the transparency and democratic scrutiny of that assistance. (3) In its resolution on the implementation of macro-financial assistance to third countries of 3 June 2003, the European Parliament called for a framework regulation for macro-financial assistance in order to expedite the decision-making process and provide this financial instrument with a formal and transparent basis. (4) In its conclusions of 8 October 2002, the Council established criteria (the so-called Genval criteria) to guide macro-financial assistance operations. It would be appropriate to update and clarify these criteria, inter alia the criteria for determining the appropriate form of assistance (a loan, a grant or a combination thereof).",

It would be appropriate to update and clarify these criteria, inter alia the criteria for determining the appropriate form of assistance (a loan, a grant or a combination thereof). (5) These principles should enable the Union to make macro-financial assistance available expeditiously, in particular when circumstances call for immediate action, and to increase the clarity and transparency of the criteria applicable to the implementation of macro-financial assistance. (6) The Commission should ensure that macro-financial assistance is in line with the key principles, objectives and measures taken within the different areas of external action and other relevant Union policies. (7) Macro-financial assistance should support the Unions external policy. The Commission services and the European External Action Service (EEAS) should work closely together throughout the macro-financial assistance operation in order to coordinate, and to ensure the consistency of, Union external policy. (8) Macro-financial assistance should support the beneficiaries commitment to common values shared with the Union, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights, sustainable development and poverty reduction, and to the principles of open, rules-based and fair trade. (9) A pre-condition for granting macro-financial assistance should be that the eligible country respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. Those pre-conditions should be regularly monitored by the Commission. (10) The specific objectives of individual macro-financial assistance decisions should include the strengthening of the efficiency, transparency and accountability of public finance management in the beneficiaries. The achievement of these objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission. (11) Macro-financial assistance should aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external finance situation for third countries and territories that are facing a shortage of foreign currency and related external financing difficulties. Macro-financial assistance should neither provide regular financial support, nor have as its primary aim the support of the economic and social development of the beneficiaries. (12) Macro-financial assistance should be complementary to the resources provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral financial institutions, and there should be fair burden-sharing between the Union and other donors. Macro-financial assistance should ensure the added value of the involvement of the Union. (13) In order to ensure that the Unions financial interests linked to macro-financial assistance are protected efficiently, the beneficiaries should take appropriate measures relating to the prevention of, and the fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to this assistance, and provision should be made for checks by the Commission and for audits by the Court of Auditors. (14) The choice of the procedure for the adoption of the memoranda of understanding should be decided in accordance with the criteria set out in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.",

In this context, the advisory procedure should apply as a general rule, but considering the potentially important impact of the operations superior to the threshold set out in part B, it is appropriate that the examination procedure is used for the latter operations. PART B - PRINCIPLES 1. Aim of the assistance (a) Macro-financial assistance should be an exceptional financial instrument of untied and undesignated balance-of-payments support to eligible third countries and territories. It should aim to restore a sustainable external finance situation for eligible countries and territories facing external financing difficulties. It should underpin the implementation of a policy programme that contains strong adjustment and structural reform measures designed to improve the balance of payment position, in particular over the programme period, and reinforce the implementation of relevant agreements and programmes with the Union. (b) Macro-financial assistance should be conditional on a significant and residual external financing gap having been determined by the Commission in cooperation with the multilateral financial institutions over and above the resources provided by the IMF and other multilateral institutions, despite the implementation of strong economic stabilisation and reform programmes by the relevant country or territory. (c) Macro-financial assistance should be of a short-term nature and should be discontinued as soon as the external financial situation has been brought back to a sustainable situation. 2. Eligible countries and territories The third countries and territories eligible to become beneficiaries of macro-financial assistance should be: \u00c2\u201d candidate and potential candidate countries, \u00c2\u201d countries and territories covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, \u00c2\u201d in exceptional and duly justified circumstances, other third countries that play a determining role in regional stability, are of strategic importance for the Union, and are politically, economically and geographically close to the Union. 3. Form of the assistance (a) Macro-financial assistance should generally take the form of a loan. In exceptional cases, however, the assistance may be provided in the form of a grant or a combination of a loan and a grant. When determining the appropriate share of a possible grant element, the Commission, when preparing its proposal, should take into consideration the level of economic development of the beneficiary, as measured by per capita income and poverty ratios, as well as its ability to repay, drawing on debt sustainability analysis while ensuring that the principle of fair burden-sharing between the Union and other donors is respected. For this purpose, the Commission should also take into account the extent to which international financial institutions and other donors apply concessional terms to the country in question. (b) Where macro-financial assistance takes the form of a loan, the Commission should be empowered on behalf of the Union to borrow the necessary funds on the capital markets or from financial institutions and on-lend them to the beneficiary.",

(d) All costs incurred by the Union which relate to borrowing or lending operations should be borne by the beneficiary. (e) At the request of the beneficiary, and where circumstances permit an improvement of the interest rate of the loan, the Commission may decide to refinance all or part of its initial borrowings or restructure the corresponding financial conditions. Refinancing and restructuring operations should be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down in point 3(d) and should not have the effect of extending the average maturity of the borrowing concerned or of increasing the amount of capital outstanding at the date of the refinancing or restructuring. 4. Financial provisions (a) The amounts of macro-financial assistance provided in the form of grants should be consistent with the budget appropriations provided for in the multi-annual financial framework. (b) The amounts of macro-financial assistance provided in the form of loans should be provisioned in accordance with the Regulation establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions. The amounts of the provisions should be consistent with the budget appropriations provided for in the multi-annual financial framework. (c) Annual appropriations should be authorised by the budgetary authority within the limits of the multi-annual financial framework. 5. Amount of the assistance (a) The determination of the amount of the assistance should be based on the residual external financing needs of the eligible country or territory, and should take into account its capacity to finance itself with its own resources, and in particular the international reserves at its disposal. Those financing needs should be determined by the Commission in cooperation with international financial institutions, based on a complete quantitative assessment and transparent supporting documentation. In particular, the Commission should draw on the latest balance of payments projections of the IMF for the relevant country or territory and take into account the expected financial contributions from multilateral donors, as well as the pre-existing deployment of the Unions other external financing instruments in that eligible country or territory. (b) The Commission documentation should contain information on the projected stock of foreign exchange reserves in the absence of macro-financial assistance compared to levels considered to be adequate, as measured by relevant indicators such as the ratio of reserves to short-term external debt and the ratio of reserves to imports of the beneficiary country. (c) The determination of the amount of macro-financial assistance provided should also take into account the need to ensure fair burden sharing between the Union and the other donors and the added value of the overall Union involvement.",

(d) Where the financing needs of the beneficiary decrease fundamentally during the period of disbursement of the macro-financial assistance compared to the initial projections, the Commission should, in accordance with the advisory procedure where the assistance is equal to or below EUR 90 million, and in accordance with the examination procedure where the assistance is above EUR 90 million, reduce the amount of such assistance or suspend or cancel it. 6. Conditionality (a) A pre-condition for granting macro-financial assistance should be that the eligible country or territory respects effective democratic mechanisms, including a multi-party parliamentary system and the rule of law and guarantees respect for human rights. The Commission should provide a publicly available assessment (1) on the fulfilment of this pre-condition and should monitor it throughout the life-cycle of the macro-financial assistance. This point should be applied in accordance with the Decision establishing the organisation and functioning of the EEAS. (b) Macro-financial assistance should be conditional on the existence of a non-precautionary credit arrangement between the eligible country or territory and the IMF, which fulfils the following conditions: \u00c2\u201d the objective of the arrangement is consistent with the purpose of the macro-financial assistance, namely to alleviate short-term balance of payment difficulties; \u00c2\u201d the implementation of strong adjustment measures consistent with the aim of macro-financial assistance, as defined in point 1(a). (c) The disbursement of the assistance should be conditional on a continuous satisfactory track record in respect of an IMF-supported policy programme and on the fulfilment of the pre-condition referred to in letter (a) of this point. It should also be conditional on the implementation, within a specific time frame, of a series of clearly defined economic policy measures focusing on structural reforms and sound public finances, to be agreed between the Commission and the beneficiary and to be laid down in a Memorandum of Understanding. (d) With a view to protecting the Unions financial interests and reinforcing the beneficiaries governance, the Memorandum of Understanding should include measures that aim to enhance the efficiency, transparency and accountability of public finance management systems. (e) Progress in mutual market opening, the development of rules-based and fair trade and other priorities in the context of the Unions external policy should also be duly taken into account in designing the policy measures. (f) The policy measures should be consistent with the existing partnership agreements, cooperation agreements or association agreements concluded between the Union and the beneficiary and with the macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform programmes implemented by the beneficiary with the support of the IMF. 7.
