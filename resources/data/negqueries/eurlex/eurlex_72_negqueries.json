This allows the budget funds of the Union available to the external regions to be complemented by the financial strength of the EIB for the benefit of the targeted third countries. In undertaking such financing operations, the EIB indirectly contributes to the general principles and policy objectives of the Union, which include reducing poverty through inclusive growth and sustainable economy, environmental and social development and the prosperity of the Union in changing global economic circumstances. (2) Article 209(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with Article 208 thereof, provides that the EIB is to contribute, under the terms laid down in its Statute, to the implementation of the measures necessary to further the objectives of Union development cooperation policy. (3) With a view to supporting Union external action, and in order to enable the EIB to finance investments outside the Union without affecting the credit standing of the EIB, the majority of its operations outside the Union have benefited from an EU budgetary guarantee (EU guarantee) administered by the Commission. This further supports EIB's creditworthiness towards the financial markets, which is of primary importance. (4) The latest EU guarantee for EIB financing operations signed during the period from 1 February 2007 to 31 December 2013 was established by Decision No 1080/2011/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). An EU guarantee for EIB financing operations outside the Union in support of Union policies should be established for the 2014-20 multiannual financial framework.",

(5) The Guarantee Fund for external actions (Guarantee Fund), established by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 (3), provides a liquidity cushion for the Union budget against losses incurred on EIB financing operations and on macro-financial assistance and Euratom loans outside the Union. (6) A list of countries potentially eligible for EIB financing under the EU guarantee should be established. It is also appropriate to establish a list of countries actually eligible for EIB financing under the EU guarantee. (7) Bhutan should be added to the list of countries actually eligible for EIB financing and Myanmar/Burma should be added to both lists following the recent developments which allowed the Union to open a new chapter in its relations with Bhutan and Myanmar/Burma in order to support the ongoing political and economic reforms in both countries. (8) In order to reflect significant policy developments, the list of countries actually eligible for EIB financing operations under the EU guarantee should be reviewed as appropriate and the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to Annex III to this Decision. The Commission's amendments to Annex III should be based on an overall assessment including economic, social, environmental and political aspects, in particular those related to the democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of all relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. (9) In order to cater for the potential evolution of the actual provisioning needs of the Guarantee Fund in accordance with Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009, the maximum ceiling of the EU guarantee should be broken down into a fixed ceiling of a maximum amount of EUR 27 000 000 000 and an optional additional amount of EUR 3 000 000 000. The provisioning of the Guarantee Fund in the general budget of the Union (budget line 01 03 06) is made ex-post on the basis of the outturn figures for outstanding guaranteed external lending at the end of year n-2. In view of the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1638/2006 laying down general provisions establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, reflows deriving from Mediterranean risk capital and loan investments under operations concluded before 2007 using Union budget funds have been accumulated in a fiduciary account established for the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP). Part of these reflows should be used for the Guarantee Fund as an exceptional measure to ensure that the ceilings of EIB financing operations under this Decision are sustained at an appropriate level for the 2014-20 period.",

The remaining funds should be returned to the general budget of the Union. (10) Issues to be considered for the activation, in whole or in part, of the optional additional amount should include: progress in the implementation of this Decision by the EIB, in particular the results of EIB operations based on information from, amongst others, the Results Measurement framework (REM), including the development impact; the provisioning needs of the Guarantee Fund taking into account past and future outstanding amounts on all activities covered by the Guarantee Fund; the macroeconomic, financial and political situation of the eligible regions and countries at the time of the mid-term review. (11) The amounts covered by the EU guarantee in each region should continue to represent ceilings for the EIB financing under the EU guarantee and not targets that the EIB is required to meet. The ceilings should be evaluated as part of the mid-term review of this Decision, in particular in light of possible changes to the list of regions and countries actually eligible for EIB financing. (12) EIB financing operations should be consistent with the beneficiary country's own strategies. Against this background, in order to enhance the coherence and the focus of the EIB external financing activity on supporting Union policies, and for the maximum benefit of beneficiaries, Decision No 1080/2011/EU sets out general objectives for EIB financing operations across all eligible regions and countries, i.e. local private sector development, in particular in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), social and economic infrastructure and climate change mitigation and adaptation, building on the comparative strengths of the EIB in areas where it has a well-proven track record. These objectives should be maintained in this Decision to further promote sustainable growth and job creation. (13) Improving access to financing for SMEs, including SMEs from the Union investing in the regions covered by this Decision, can play an essential role in stimulating economic development and in combating unemployment. In order to effectively reach out to SMEs, the EIB financing operations should be result-oriented. The EIB should, where possible, invest in research and innovation by SMEs as a means of supporting local development. The EIB should cooperate with local financial intermediary institutions in the eligible countries, which should be integrated into the local economy, in particular to ensure that part of the financial benefits is passed on to their clients and that added value is provided compared to other sources of finance. The EIB should also, as far as possible, increase the diversification of its financial partners in the countries in which it operates. During its due diligence, the EIB should assess if financing operations supporting SMEs via a financial intermediary are in line with the regional technical operational guidelines, the REM and the EIB standards.",

The EIB should establish a reporting mechanism to make sure that the funds dedicated to SMEs are used for their benefit. A consolidated report on SMEs financing under this Decision should be provided by the EIB as part of its contribution to the mid-term review. (14) The coverage of the EU guarantee, which is limited to risks of a sovereign and political nature, is not sufficient in itself to ensure a meaningful EIB activity in support of micro-finance. Therefore such activity, where appropriate, should be carried out in connection with budgetary resources available under other instruments and via intermediary institutions including at local level as a means to promote growth and contribute indirectly to reducing poverty in poorer countries. (15) The EIB should continue to finance investment projects in the areas of social, environmental, and economic infrastructure, including transport and energy, and should consider increasing its activity in support of health and education infrastructure when there is clear added value in doing so. (16) To reinforce the climate change dimension of the EU guarantee, an overall volume of operations target and a system allowing to ex-ante assess greenhouse gas emissions of projects supported under the EU guarantee should be introduced. EIB financing operations in support of climate change mitigation and adaptation should represent at least 25 % of total EIB financing operations in order to further the promotion of the Union's climate goals on a global scale. The EIB should provide its technical expertise in cooperation with the Commission to support public and private counterparties benefitting from EIB financing operations in order to address the challenge of climate change and to make the best possible use of available financing. Concessional funding should be available for mitigation and adaptation projects. EIB financing operations should, where possible and appropriate, be complemented by funds from the general budget of the Union through the efficient and appropriate blending of grants and loans for climate change financing in the context of Union external assistance. In this regard, the Commission's annual report to the European Parliament and the Council should contain a detailed report on the financial instruments used for financing these projects, identifying the amounts of EIB financing operations and the corresponding amounts of grants. (17) Within the areas covered by the general objectives, regional integration among countries, in particular economic integration between Pre-accession countries, Neighbourhood countries and the Union, should be an underlying objective for EIB financing operations.",

In that context, the EIB should be able to support partner countries within areas covered by the general objectives through foreign direct investments by companies from the Union that promote economic integration with the Union and that contribute to promoting technology and knowledge transfer, provided that appropriate consideration has been given during the investment projects' due diligence to minimise the risks that EIB financing operations lead to negative repercussions on employment in the Union. The EIB should also be encouraged to support foreign direct investment in partner countries by companies from the Union at its own risk, taking into account the EIB's risk-bearing capacity. (18) The EIB should regularly conduct ex post or mid-term evaluations of supported activities under this Decision with a view to assessing their relevance, performance and development effects and to identify aspects that could improve future activities. Such evaluations should contribute to accountability and analysis of sustainability. (19) The practical measures for linking the general objectives of the EU guarantee and their implementation are to be set out in regional technical operational guidelines. Such guidelines should be consistent with the wider Union regional policy framework, including the differentiation principle in the European Neighbourhood Policy. The regional technical operational guidelines should be reviewed following the adoption of this Decision and further updated following the mid-term review in order to adapt to the developments in the Union external policies and priorities. The update of the regional operational technical guidelines should, among other considerations, take into account relevant developments in the eligible countries. (20) In accordance with Protocol No 5 on the Statute of the European Investment Bank annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the TFEU, applications made directly to the EIB for EIB financing operations to be carried out under this Decision are to be submitted to the Commission for an opinion on the conformity with relevant Union legislation and policies. In the case of EIB financing operations falling under this Decision, where the Commission delivers a negative opinion on any such operation, that operation should not be covered by the EU guarantee. (21) While the EIB's strength remains its distinctive model as a publicly owned investment bank whose remit is that of providing long-term lending so as to meet the policy goals set by its shareholders, EIB financing operations should contribute to the general principles guiding Union external action, as referred to in Article 21 TEU, of consolidating and supporting democracy and the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to the implementation of international commitments and agreements, including environmental agreements to which the Union is a party. In particular, the EIB should contribute to economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries in accordance with Article 212 TFEU.",

EIB actions should also be in line with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention) at relevant stages of the project cycle. In relation to developing countries, EIB financing operations should foster their sustainable economic, social and environmental development, particularly in the most disadvantaged amongst them, their smooth and gradual integration into the world economy, as well as compliance with objectives approved by the Union in the context of the United Nations and other relevant international organisations. While contributing to the implementation of the measures necessary to further the objectives of Union development cooperation policy in accordance with Article 209(3) TFEU, the EIB should strive to support indirectly the achievement of the United Nations' 2015 Millennium Development Goals, and after 2015 the achievement of any new development targets which might modify or replace the Millennium Development Goals, in all regions where it is active. (22) The EIB activity under this Decision should support the implementation of the European Consensus on Development, of the Agenda for Change and of the principles of aid effectiveness outlined in the Paris Declaration of 2005, the Accra Agenda for Action of 2008 and the Busan Partnership Agreement of 2011. Furthermore, it should be coherent with the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy adopted by the Council on 25 June 2012 and international environmental agreements including biodiversity commitments.

In this context, the EIB should implement and further develop its REM which provides a detailed set of performance indicators measuring the economic, environmental, social, and development impact of its financing operations throughout the EIB project cycle. The implementation of the REM should be evaluated as part of the mid-term review of this Decision. When carrying out due diligence in respect of an investment project, the EIB should, where appropriate and in line with the Union's social and environmental principles and international best practices, as well as Union law and the national law of the beneficiary country, require the investment project promoter to carry out local consultations and disclose their results to the public in order to take account of the impact of projects on the relevant stakeholders.

(23) At all levels, from upstream strategic planning to downstream investment project development, it should be ensured that EIB financing operations comply with and support Union external policies and the general objectives set out in this Decision. With a view to increasing the coherence of Union external action, dialogue on policy and strategy should be further strengthened between the Commission and the EIB, including the European External Action Service (EEAS), while keeping the European Parliament and the Council duly informed. EIB offices outside the Union should whenever possible be located within Union delegations in order to foster such cooperation while sharing operating costs. The Memorandum of Understanding between the European Commission and the European Investment Bank in respect of cooperation and coordination in the regions covered by the External Mandate, which was revised in 2013 enhancing cooperation and early mutual exchange of information between the Commission, the EEAS and the EIB at operational level, should continue to be applied. Cooperation in the framework of the Memorandum of Understanding should in particular include a regular review of the application of the differentiation principle in Neighbourhood countries. It is of particular importance to have an early and systematic exchange of views between the Commission and the EIB, including the EEAS, as appropriate, in the process of preparing relevant programming documents in order to maximise synergies between their activities.

Following Decision No 1080/2011/EU, the Commission established an EU Platform for Blending in External Cooperation with a view to optimising the functioning of mechanisms for the blending of grants and loans outside the Union in particular in implementing the general budget of the Union and EIB loans respectively, and exchanging best practices on governance and on evaluation criteria at project level. The participation of the EIB and other financial institutions in blending mechanisms should be fully in line with the Union's external objectives, aid effectiveness and transparency.

This cooperation includes, where appropriate, cooperation on sector conditionality and mutual reliance on procedures, use of co-financing and participation in global initiatives, such as those promoting aid coordination and effectiveness. Such coordination and cooperation should strive to minimise possible duplication of costs and unnecessary overlap. Cooperation should be based on the principle of reciprocity. Reciprocal access by the EIB to financial instruments set up by other European and international financial institutions should be promoted, as appropriate.

(26) The EIB should be encouraged to continue to finance operations outside the Union also at its own risk, including in support of Union economic interests, in countries and in favour of investment projects having a sufficient creditworthiness according to the assessment of the EIB and taking into account its own risk absorption capacity, so that the use of the EU guarantee can be focused on countries and investment projects where the EU guarantee provides added value on the basis of EIB own assessment, including in terms of sustainable economic, social and environmental development. (27) The EIB should expand the range of innovative financial instruments it offers, including by focusing more on developing guarantee instruments. Moreover, the EIB should actively seek to participate in risk sharing instruments and debt capital market financing of projects with stable and predictable cash flow generation. In particular, it should consider supporting debt capital market instruments issued or granted for the benefit of an investment project carried out in the eligible countries. In addition, the EIB should increase its provision of loans in local currencies and issue bonds in local markets, provided that beneficiary countries put in place the necessary structural reforms, in particular in the financial sector, as well as other measures to facilitate EIB activities. In the diversification and expansion of capital market instruments, special care should be taken to ensure that such instruments do not lead to risky financial practices and indebtedness and therefore could threaten financial stability.

The report should assess EIB financing operations and their compliance with this Decision, their added value and contribution to the Union external policies, their quality, their development impact drawing on the EIB's REM and the financial benefits transferred to beneficiaries. The report should also include information on calls on the EU guarantee, on climate change and biodiversity financing under this Decision, on the follow-up of the functioning of the Memorandum of Understanding between the EIB and the European Ombudsman, and a description of the cooperation with the Commission and other European and international financial institutions, including co-financing. The report should be made public in order to allow relevant stakeholders, including civil society, to express their views. (29) The EIB financing operations in support of Union external policies should continue to be conducted in accordance with the principles of sound banking practice. They should continue to be managed in accordance with the EIB's own rules and procedures, which should reflect those principles, including appropriate control measures and compliance with the EIB's statement on social and environmental standards, as well as with the relevant rules and procedures concerning the Court of Auditors and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).",

South Africa South Africa ANNEX IV REGIONAL POLICY FRAMEWORK EIB activity in partners participating in the pre-accession process takes place in the framework established in the Accession and European Partnerships which set out the priorities for candidates and potential candidates with a view to making progress in moving closer to the Union, and which provide a framework for Union assistance. The Stabilisation and Association Process is the Union policy framework for the Western Balkans. It is based on progressive partnership, in which the Union offers trade concessions, economic and financial assistance and contractual relationships through Stabilisation and Association Agreements. Pre-accession financial assistance helps the candidates and potential candidates prepare for the obligations and challenges of membership of the Union. This assistance supports the reform process, including preparations for eventual membership. It focuses on institution-building, alignment with the acquis of the Union, preparation for Union policies and instruments and promotion of measures to achieve economic convergence. EIB activity in Neighbourhood countries takes place in the framework of the new European Neighbourhood Policy set out in the Joint Communication entitled A new response to a changing Neighbourhood, adopted by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission on 25 May 2011, and the Council conclusions adopted on 20 June 2011, which calls notably for greater support to partners committed to building democratic societies and undertaking reforms, in line with the more for more and mutual accountability principles, and provides the strategic policy framework for the Union relations with the neighbours. In the framework of this cooperation, EIB financing under this Decision will also be targeted at policies promoting inclusive growth and job creation contributing to social stability in line with an incentive-based approach supporting Union external policy objectives, including in relation to migration issues. In order to achieve these objectives the Union and its partners implement jointly agreed bilateral action plans defining a set of priorities including on political and security issues, trade and economic matters, environmental and social concerns and integration of transport and energy networks. The Union for the Mediterranean, the Eastern Partnership, the Black Sea Synergy, the Union Strategy for the Danube Region and the Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region are multilateral and regional initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation between the Union and the respective group of Neighbourhood partner countries facing common challenges and/or sharing a common geographical environment. The Union for the Mediterranean aims to relaunch the Euro-Mediterranean integration process by supporting mutual economic, social and environmental development on both sides of the Mediterranean and supports improved socioeconomic development, solidarity, regional integration, sustainable development and knowledge building, underlining the need to increase financial cooperation to support regional and trans-national projects.",

The Eastern Partnership aims to create the necessary conditions to accelerate political association and further economic integration between the Union and Eastern partner countries. The Eastern Partnership will provide additional impetus to the economic and social and regional development of the partner countries. It will facilitate good governance, including in the financial sector, promote regional development and social cohesion and help to reduce partner countries' socioeconomic disparities. The Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region supports a sustainable environment and optimal economic and social development in the Baltic Sea region. The Union Strategy for the Danube Region supports, in particular, the development of transport, energy connections and security, sustainable environment and socioeconomic development in the Danube region. The Eastern Partnership aims to create the necessary conditions to accelerate political association and further economic integration between the Union and Eastern partner countries. Russia and the Union have a wide-ranging strategic partnership, distinct from the European Neighbourhood Policy and expressed through the Common Spaces and Roadmaps. These are complemented at multilateral level by the Northern Dimension which provides a framework for cooperation between the Union, Russia, Norway and Iceland (Belarus, Canada and the United States are observers to the Northern Dimension). EIB activity in Latin America takes place in the framework of the Union, Latin America and the Caribbean Strategic Partnership. As highlighted in the 30 September 2009 Commission Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council entitled The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership, the Union's priorities in the field of cooperation towards Latin America are the promotion of regional integration and the eradication of poverty and social inequality in order to promote sustainable economic and social development. These policy objectives will be fostered taking into account the different level of development of Latin American countries. Bilateral dialogue and cooperation will be pursued in areas of common interest for both regions, including environment, climate change, disaster risk reduction and energy, science, research, higher education, technology and innovation. In Asia, the Union is deepening its strategic partnerships with China and India and negotiations are progressing on new partnership and free trade agreements with South-East Asian countries. At the same time, development cooperation remains high on the Union's agenda with Asia; the Union development strategy for the Asian region aims at eradicating poverty by supporting broad-based sustainable economic growth, promoting a conducive environment and conditions for trade and integration within the region, enhancing governance, increasing political and social stability, and supporting the achievement of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. Policies are being put in place jointly to address common challenges, such as climate change, sustainable development, security and stability, governance and human rights, as well as the prevention of, and response to, natural and humanitarian disasters.",

The Union Strategy for a new partnership with Central Asia adopted by the European Council of 21-22 June 2007 has strengthened regional and bilateral dialogue and Union cooperation with Central Asian countries on major issues facing the region, such as poverty reduction, sustainable development and stability. The implementation of the strategy has brought about important advances in the fields of human rights, the rule of law, good governance and democracy, education, economic development, trade and investment, energy and transport and environmental policies. EIB activity in South Africa takes place in the framework of the Joint EU Country Strategy Paper for South Africa. The main focal areas identified in that Strategy Paper are employment creation and capacity development for service delivery and social cohesion. EIB activities in South Africa have taken place in high complementarity with the Union development cooperation programme, namely through the EIB focus on private sector support and investments in expansion of infrastructure and social services (housing, electric power, drinking water purification and municipal infrastructure). The mid-term review of the EU Country Strategy Paper for South Africa conducted in 2009-10 has proposed the strengthening of actions in the area of climate-change through activities supporting the creation of green jobs. For the period 2014-20, EIB activity is expected to support in a complementary fashion Union external cooperation policies, programmes and instruments by continuing to focus on key EU-South Africa priorities in order to promote equitable and sustainable economic growth, contribute to employment creation and capacity development, and support the sustainable provision and equitable access to basic infrastructure and services.",
