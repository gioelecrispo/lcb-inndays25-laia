If the President does not make a nomination, the Secretary of the Treasury could perform the duties\nhimself or assign them to another official of his department. December 19, 2002 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL\nDEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY You have asked for our opinion whether the President has a legal duty to make\na nomination for Under Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement. We believe\nthat he does not. You have further asked how, if the President does not make a\nnomination, the duties of the office may be discharged. We believe that the\nSecretary of the Treasury (\u201cSecretary\u201d) could perform the duties himself or assign\nthem to another official of his department. I.\nUnder 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(d) (2000), the Department of the Treasury \u201chas . . . an\nUnder Secretary for Enforcement . . . appointed by the President, by and with the\nadvice and consent of the Senate.\u201d At present, this Under Secretary supervises the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, but the recently enacted Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002), which will\nbecome effective January 24, 2003, id. \u00a7 4, 116 Stat. at 2142, will largely transfer\nthat bureau to the Department of Justice. Id. \u00a7 1111(c). The Treasury Department\nwill retain only the bureau\u2019s administration and revenue collection functions,\nwhich will be performed by a newly created Tax and Trade Bureau. Id. \u00a7 1111(d). The Tax and Trade Bureau is to be headed by an Administrator, \u201cwho shall\nperform such duties as assigned by the Under Secretary for Enforcement of the\nDepartment of the Treasury.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1111(d)(2). In addition to assigning these\nduties, the Under Secretary for Enforcement implicitly will have one other\nstatutory responsibility: to receive advice and recommendations from the Director\nof the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network about \u201cmatters relating to financial\nintelligence, financial criminal activities, and other financial activities.\u201d 31\nU.S.C.A. \u00a7 310(b)(2)(A) (West. Supp. 2002). In view of the highly limited statutory duties that the Under Secretary for\nEnforcement will exercise after the Homeland Security Act takes effect, you have\nraised the possibility that the President might not wish to fill the next vacancy in\nthat office. 230 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 240 10/22/12 11:13 AM Under Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement II. Our opinions do not definitively resolve whether, in these circumstances, the\nPresident has a legal duty to make a nomination. Some statutes provide that the\nPresident \u201cshall\u201d nominate and, with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent, appoint a\nparticular officer, and these statutes may be understood to require the President to\nmake a nomination within a reasonable time.",

See Memorandum [for the Acting\nAttorney General], from Robert G. Dixon, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, Office\nof Legal Counsel, Re: Applicability of the 30-Day Vacancies Act Time Limit to\nYour Tenure as Acting Attorney General at 29-30 (Dec. 7, 1973) (the statute\nproviding for appointment of the Attorney General and the President\u2019s constitutional responsibilities \u201ccreate a legal duty\u2014and not merely political pressure\u2014to\nsubmit a nomination within a reasonable time after the vacancy occurred\u201d); see\nalso Memorandum for the Attorney General, from Golden W. Bell, Assistant\nSolicitor General, Re: Vacancy in the Office of Attorney General, 8 Unpub. Op.\nA.S.G. 1538, 1540 (Dec. 5, 1938). But see Letter for the President, from Homer\nCummings, Attorney General, 2 Unpub. Op. A.S.G. 447 (Jan. 24, 1934). 1 Other\nstatutes provide that the President \u201cmay\u201d make nominations and appointments. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 (2000) (Deputy Attorney General). By their plain terms,\nthese other statutes give the President the discretion to leave the offices unfilled. Here, the language of the statute is that the Treasury Department \u201chas\u201d an\nUnder Secretary for Enforcement. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(d). This language appears to\ndescribe, rather than prescribe, the make-up of the Department. Along these lines,\nthe Senate Committee on Appropriations\u2019 Explanatory Statement on the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994, the bill that enacted the language,\nobserved that the provision would \u201cpermit the President to nominate, with the\nadvice and consent of the Senate, a third Under Secretary of the Treasury.\u201d 140\nCong. Rec. 2031 (1994) (emphasis added). 2 At the least, Congress imposed no\nclear obligation upon the President to make a nomination, and we would not read\n1 In other instances, we have more generally identified a duty to submit a nomination when an\nofficial is \u201cacting\u201d in an office and thus when failure to make a nomination within a reasonable time\nmight undercut the Senate\u2019s role of advice and consent. See, e.g., Status of the Acting Director, Office\nof Management and Budget, 1 Op. O.L.C. 287, 290 (1977); Memorandum for the Attorney General,\nfrom Dawn Johnsen, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Acting Designation (Dec. 12, 1997); see also Letter for the President, from Homer Cummings, Attorney General,\n6 Unpub.

On Governmental Affairs, 105 Cong. 138, 148 (1998)\n(statement of Joseph N. Onek, Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General, and Daniel Koffsky,\nSpecial Counsel, Office of Legal Counsel). 2\nCongress in 1993 directed that \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the\nTreasury shall establish an Office of the Undersecretary for Enforcement within the Department of the\nTreasury by no later than February 15, 1994.\u201d Pub.

      "content": "Congress enacted the current language of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(d) in 1994. Neither of these enactments\nanswers the question whether Congress has required the filling of the office to be established. 231 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 241 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26 one into the statute: \u201cWhen Congress decides purposefully to enact legislation\nrestricting or regulating presidential action, it must make its intent clear.\u201d Armstrong v. Bush, 924 F.2d 282, 289 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (emphasis added). To be sure, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 also provides that \u201c[t]he President may appoint, by\nand with the advice and consent of the Senate, an Assistant General Counsel who\nshall be the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d 31 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 301(f)(2), and the use of \u201cmay\u201d in this provision arguably suggests that, in\ncontrast, the \u201chas . . . an Under Secretary for Enforcement\u201d language was intended\nto impose a duty on the President to fill the office of Under Secretary for\nEnforcement. See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (\u201c[W]here\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in\nanother section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But this possible inference hardly makes \u201cclear\u201d that\nCongress intended to fix a duty upon the President. Armstrong, 924 F.2d at 289. Indeed, the provision on the Chief Counsel continues: \u201cThe Chief Counsel is the\nchief law officer for the Service and shall carry out duties and powers prescribed\nby the Secretary.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(f)(2). As this additional language shows,\nsection 301 does not invariably use the present tense of verbs (\u201chas\u201d or \u201cis\u201d) to\nrefer to offices that necessarily will be filled, and no inference should be drawn\nfrom the use of the words \u201chas . . . an Under Secretary for Enforcement\u201d rather\nthan some variation of the \u201cmay appoint\u201d formulation. III. If the President leaves the office unfilled, the remaining duties of the office\nmust be carried out by some other official. As noted above, the Under Secretary\nfor Enforcement assigns duties to the Tax and Trade Bureau and receives advice\nand recommendations from the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement\nNetwork. Absent new legislation, there are, we believe, two basic ways in which\nthese responsibilities could be performed. First, the Secretary himself could assign duties to the Tax and Trade Bureau\nand receive the reports from the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement\nNetwork. Under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(c) (2000), \u201c[d]uties and powers of officers and\nemployees of the Department are vested in the Secretary,\u201d with some express\nexceptions not relevant here. The Secretary, therefore, could carry out these duties. Interpreting similar language applicable to the Attorney General, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 509\n(2000), we have concluded that the provision sets up a \u201cgeneral standing rule that\nall functions performed by officers in the Department of Justice are vested\nultimately in the Attorney General and may be performed by him.\u201d",

We would find a similar \u201cgeneral standing rule\u201d under 31\nU.S.C. \u00a7 321(c). Although this \u201cstanding rule\u201d may be overcome when, for\nexample, there is a \u201cspecific and explicit reservation of \u2018final\u2019 decisionmaking\npower\u201d in a subordinate official, 1980 Opinion at 2, no such reservation or other\nlimit applies to the duties of the Under Secretary for Enforcement. See also, e.g.,\nVacancy Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345-3349)\u2014Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, 2 Op. O.L.C. 72, 74 (1978) (the functions of the Law Enforcement Assistance\nAdministration, unlike \u201cmost of the components of the Department,\u201d were not\n\u201ccompletely vested in the Attorney General,\u201d although the Attorney General had\nsupervisory power). Accordingly, the Secretary himself could perform those\nduties. Second, we believe that the Secretary could exercise his power under 31 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 321(b)(2) to \u201cdelegate [his] duties and powers . . . to another officer or employee\nof the Department of the Treasury.\u201d With 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(c) having vested in the\nSecretary the duties of the Under Secretary for Enforcement, section 321(b)(2)\nwould allow the Secretary to assign those duties to another officer or employee of\nthe Treasury Department. Once again, we have recognized the lawfulness of\nsimilar arrangements under the statutes governing the Department of Justice. See\nMemorandum for the Deputy Attorney General, from John C. Yoo, Deputy\nAssistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, and Rosemary Hart, Senior\nCounsel, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Granting Special Deputy United States\nMarshal Status to Private Security Guards at 3 n.1 (Oct. 30, 2001) (function of the\nMarshals Service is vested in the Attorney General and delegated to the Deputy\nAttorney General). We can identify no bar to the exercise of this authority in the present case. Although Congress may restrict the transfers of particular authorities to particular\ncomponents, see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. app. 3, \u00a7 9(a)(2) (2000) (ordinarily barring the\ntransfer of \u201cprogram operating responsibilities\u201d to an Inspector General), no such\nrestriction appears applicable here. Further, under the Vacancies Reform Act,\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3345-3349d (2000), if a statute or regulation provided that only the\nUnder Secretary of Enforcement could perform a particular responsibility, and if\nthat position became vacant, only the Secretary of the Treasury himself or an\nActing Under Secretary for Enforcement could perform that function or duty. See\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3348(a)(2), (b).",
