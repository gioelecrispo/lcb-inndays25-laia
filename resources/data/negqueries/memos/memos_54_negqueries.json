June 1, 2005 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL\nOF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\nAND THE SENIOR COUNSEL TO THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL You have asked jointly for our opinion concerning the scope of 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1320d-6 (2000), the criminal enforcement provision of the Administrative\nSimplification subtitle of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\nof 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). Specifically, you have\nasked, first, whether the only persons who may be directly liable under section\n1320d-6 are those persons to whom the substantive requirements of the subtitle, as\nset forth in the regulations promulgated thereunder, apply\u2014i.e., health plans,\nhealth care clearinghouses, certain health care providers, and Medicare prescription drug card sponsors\u2014or whether this provision may also render directly liable\nother persons, particularly those who obtain protected health information in a\nmanner that causes a person to whom the substantive requirements of the subtitle\napply to release the information in violation of that law. We conclude that health\nplans, health care clearinghouses, those health care providers specified in the\nstatute, and Medicare prescription drug card sponsors may be prosecuted for\nviolations of section 1320d-6. In addition, depending on the facts of a given case,\ncertain directors, officers, and employees of these entities may be liable directly\nunder section 1320d-6, in accordance with general principles of corporate criminal\nliability, as these principles are developed in the course of particular prosecutions. Other persons may not be liable directly under this provision. The liability of\npersons for conduct that may not be prosecuted directly under section 1320d-6 will\nbe determined by principles of aiding and abetting liability and of conspiracy\nliability. Second, you have asked whether the \u201cknowingly\u201d element of section\n1320d-6 requires only proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense\nor whether this element also requires proof of knowledge that the conduct was\ncontrary to the statute or regulations. We conclude that \u201cknowingly\u201d refers only to\nknowledge of the facts that constitute the offense. 1\n1\nIn reaching the conclusions discussed below, we have considered the views expressed in your\nsubmissions concerning the questions you have asked.

II. A.\nWe address first which persons may be prosecuted under the criminal enforcement provision, section 1320d-6. Specifically, we address whether section\n1320d-6 renders liable only covered entities or whether the provision applies to\nany person who does an act described in that provision, including, in particular,\na person who obtains protected health information in a manner that causes a\ncovered entity to violate the statute or regulations. We conclude that an analysis\nof liability under section 1320d-6 must begin with covered entities, the only\npersons to whom the standards apply. If the covered entity is not an individual,\ngeneral principles of corporate criminal liability will determine the entity\u2019s\nliability and that of individuals within the entity, including directors, officers,\nand employees. Finally, certain conduct of these individuals and that of other\npersons outside the covered entity, including of recipients of protected information, may be prosecuted in accordance with principles of aiding and abetting\nliability and of conspiracy liability. We begin with the language of the statute. See Liparota v. United States, 471\nU.S. 419, 424 (1985) (\u201cThe definition of the elements of a criminal offense is\nentrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal crimes, which are\nsolely the creatures of statute.\u201d).

The criminal\nenforcement provision makes it a crime to do certain acts \u201cknowingly and in\nviolation of this part.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1320d-6(a). To be sure, the statute must be read as a\nwhole and variations in the language of closely related provisions should be given\neffect if possible. See Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 191\u201393 (1998)\n(interpreting the requirement that an act be done \u201cwillfully\u201d in one subsection of\nthe statute by reference to the \u201cknowingly\u201d requirement contained in other\nsubsections of the same statute). Here, however, the difference in phrasing used in\nthe two provisions does not constitute a basis for concluding that section 1320d-6\nreaches persons who are not, or are not part of, a covered entity. Section 1320d-6\u2019s\nuse of \u201cin violation of,\u201d as opposed to \u201cwho violates,\u201d reflects only the difference\nin the scope of the conduct proscribed by the two sections. Section 1320d-5 is\nphrased as it is\u2014\u201cany person who violates a provision of this part\u201d\u2014because a\nviolation of any of the standards subjects the violator to civil penalties. 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1320d-5(a)(1). In contrast, criminal punishment is restricted to those violations\nof the standards\u2014specified in subsections (a)(1) to (a)(3) of section 1320d-6(a)\u2014\nthat involve the improper use, acquisition, or disclosure of individually identifiable\nhealth information or unique health identifiers.

Having described the prohibited acts using present tense verbs, the\nprovision could not retain the \u201cviolates this part\u201d formulation; instead, it uses \u201cin\nviolation of this part\u201d to make clear that only those uses, acquisitions, and\ndisclosures in a manner contrary to the regulations are illegal. The difference in\nlanguage between section 1320d-5 and section 1320d-6 is thus best understood as\nnothing more than a grammatical accommodation resulting from the need to\ndescribe the acts for which section 1320d-6 prescribes criminal liability. 5",

If that were the case, it might be appropriate to apply the rule of lenity and\nconclude that the statute is best read not to subject to direct prosecution persons other than covered\nentities and those rendered liable by general principles of corporate criminal liability.

Section 1320d-6\nprovides criminal penalties for \u201cperson[s]\u201d who perform the listed acts \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cin violation of this part.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1320d-6.

Although we do not\nelaborate these principles here, in general, the conduct of an entity\u2019s agents may be\nimputed to the entity when the agents act within the scope of their employment,\nand the criminal intent of agents may be imputed to the entity when the agents act\non its behalf. See Kathleen F. Brickley, Corporate Criminal Liability \u00a7\u00a7 3\u20134 (2d\ned. 1992). In addition, we recognize that, at least in limited circumstances, the\ncriminal liability of the entity has been attributed to individuals in managerial\nroles, including, at times, to individuals with no direct involvement in the offense. See id. \u00a7 5. 9 Consistent with these general principles, it may be that such individuals in particular cases may be prosecuted directly under section 1320d-6.\n7\nConsistent with our reading of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-6, the Sixth Circuit has held that the Video\nPrivacy Protection Act\u2019s (\u201cVPPA\u201d) creation of a cause of action for \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by any act\nof a person in violation of this section,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710(c)(1) (2000), allows suits against only video\ntape service providers and not against all persons. See Daniel v. Cantrell, 375 F.3d 377, 382\u201384 (6th\nCir. 2004). In that case, the plaintiff had sued several persons who were not video tape service\nproviders, alleging that they had violated the privacy right in his video rental records given him by the\nstatute. Similar to section 1320d-6, the VPPA cause of action provision refers to acts of \u201ca person in\nviolation of this section.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710(c)(1). The court reasoned that because the operative\nprovision of the VPPA provides that \u201c[a] video tape service provider who knowingly discloses . . .\npersonally identifiable information . . . shall be liable,\u201d id. \u00a7 2710(b), only such providers could be \u201cin\nviolation of\u201d the statute. Daniel, 375 F.3d at 383\u201384. Accordingly, despite the use of the broad term\n\u201cperson\u201d in section 2710(c)(1), only video tape service providers may be sued under that section. 8 The statute and regulations do not limit the actions for which a covered entity may be held liable\nto those activities that render the person a covered entity. Once a person is a covered entity, he must\n\u201ccomply with [an applicable] standard or specification,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-4(b)(1)(A) and \u201cmay not\nuse or disclose protected health information, except as permitted or required by\u201d the regulations, 45\nC.F.R. \u00a7 164.502. Thus, a physician who is a covered entity in part because he transmits certain health\ncare information electronically must not disclose such protected information, either electronically or\notherwise, except as authorized by the regulations. And a physician who is a covered entity must\ncomply with the standards with respect to protected information concerning both his own patients and\nthose patients he is not treating.",

Congress sought to create a nationwide floor for such protection. See\nPreamble, Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (\u201cPrivacy Rule\nPreamble\u201d), 65 Fed. Reg. 82,462, 82,463\u201364 (Dec. 28, 2000). Thus, HIPAA\u2019s privacy rules preempt\nonly those contrary state laws that are less stringent than the applicable federal privacy rules. See 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-7(a)(2)(B); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.203(b) (\u201cA standard, requirement, or implementation\nspecification . . . that is contrary to a provision of State law preempts the provision of State law . . .\nexcept if . . . [t]he provision of State law relates to the privacy of individually identifiable health\ninformation and is more stringent than\u201d the federal standard.). All other criminal and civil liability for\nbreaches of a duty concerning the privacy of health information that existed prior to HIPAA remains\nafter its passage. 86 Scope of Criminal Enforcement Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-6 element is best read, consistent with its ordinary meaning, to require only proof of\nknowledge of the facts that constitute the offense. We begin again with the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-6(a). See Liparota, 471 U.S.\nat 424. A person who knowingly and in violation of this part\u2014\n(1) uses or causes to be used a unique health identifier;\n(2) obtains individually identifiable health information relating to\nan individual; or\n(3) discloses individually identifiable health information to another person, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this\nsection. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-6(a). A plain reading of the text indicates that a person need not\nknow that commission of an act described in subsections (a)(1) to (a)(3) violates the\nlaw in order to satisfy the \u201cknowingly\u201d element of the offense. Section 1320d-6\nmakes the requirements that the act be done \u201cknowingly\u201d and that it be done \u201cin\nviolation of this part\u201d two distinct requirements. These two elements do not modify\neach other; rather, they independently modify \u201cuses or causes to be used,\u201d \u201cobtains,\u201d\nand \u201cdiscloses.\u201d For example, defendants will be guilty of an offense if they both\n\u201cknowingly\u201d \u201cdisclose[] individually identifiable health information\u201d and they \u201cin\nviolation of this part\u201d \u201cdisclose[] individually identifiable health information.\u201d The\nview that the statute requires proof of knowledge of the law effectively reads\n\u201cknowingly\u201d to refer to the \u201cviolation of this part.\u201d But this reading is contrary to the\nplain language of the statute, which sets forth these terms as two separate elements\neach independently modifying the third element, i.e., one of the listed acts. Accordingly, to incur criminal liability, a defendant need have knowledge only of those\nfacts that constitute the offense. Our reading of the \u201cknowingly\u201d element of the offense comports with the usual\nunderstanding of the term.",

Our reading of the \u201cknowingly\u201d element of the offense comports with the usual\nunderstanding of the term.

In fact, its text dictates an interpretation consistent with the\nordinary understanding of \u201cknowingly\u201d as referring only to \u201cknowledge of the\nfacts that constitute the offense.\u201d Id.

Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.A., 530 U.S. 1, 6 (2000). We 87 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 29 consider whether our reading of the criminal provision is absurd in light of the\npossible exception to civil liability for reasonable ignorance of the law. Sections\n1320d-5 and 1320d-6 operate in a complementary fashion, covering mutually\nexclusive conduct. See 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1320d-5(b)(1) (excepting from civil penalties\nan act that \u201cconstitutes an offense punishable under section 1320d-6 of this\ntitle.\u201d). 13 The civil enforcement section provides, \u201cA penalty may not be imposed . . . if . . . the person liable for the penalty did not know, and by exercising\nreasonable diligence would not have known, that such person violated the\nprovision.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1320d-5(b)(2). Section 1320d-5 therefore may be read to premise\ncivil liability on knowledge that the act in question violated the applicable\nstandard, not just on knowledge that the particular act occurred. 14 If civil sanctions\n(of fines up to $100) may be avoided by establishing reasonable ignorance of the\nlaw, it might at first blush appear to be an absurd result to conclude that the\nsignificantly more serious criminal punishments (of fines up to $250,000 and\nimprisonment of up to ten years) may not be similarly excused. The absurd results canon of construction is \u201crarely invoke[d] . . . to override\nunambiguous legislation.\u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 459\n(2002); Public Citizen v.

Applying the\nusual definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d here does not yield an absurd result, and certainly\nnot one so absurd that it would cause us to read the statute contrary to its plain\nmeaning.",

The argument that the statute should not be read so as to impose criminal\npunishment on the basis of a lesser degree of intent than that required for civil\nsanction would be more compelling if sections 1320d-5 and 1320d-6 covered the\nsame acts. But they do not. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-5(b)(1). Civil sanctions may be\nimposed for violations of a wide variety of regulations. For these violations, the\nstatute provides a maximum $100 fine and sets forth certain exceptions to liability. Id. \u00a7 1320d-5 (\u201cGeneral penalty for failure to comply with requirements and\nstandards\u201d). 15 In contrast, of all the possible violations of the regulations, section\n13\nThus, the Secretary may not impose civil sanctions for the commission of an act that subjects a\nperson to the possibility of criminal prosecution, regardless of whether the person is in fact punished\ncriminally. 14\nThis is not the only possible reading of section 1320d-5(b)(2). This paragraph is headed \u201cNoncompliance not discovered,\u201d and the language of the provision\u2014\u201cthe person liable for the penalty did\nnot know, and by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, that such person violated the\nprovision\u201d\u2014could be read to refer to ignorance of the facts that constitute the violation, rather than\nignorance of the law. But to answer the questions you have asked, we need not decide which reading is\nbetter. 15\nIn addition to the exception noted above, section 1320d-5(b) contains another defense to liability\nwhere \u201c(i) the failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect; and (ii) the\nfailure to comply is corrected during the 30-day period beginning on the first date the person liable for 88 Scope of Criminal Enforcement Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-6 1320d-6 carves out a limited set and subjects them to criminal punishment.

Thus, the statute reflects a\nheightened concern for violations that intrude upon the medical privacy of\nindividuals. In light of this concern, there is nothing obviously absurd about the\nstatute\u2019s allowing a defense of reasonable ignorance of the law for those regulatory violations subject to civil penalty, but withholding this defense with respect to\nthose violations that threaten the privacy of individuals. Accordingly, even reading\nsection 1320d-6 in light of section 1320d-5(b)\u2019s exception to civil liability for\nreasonable ignorance of the law gives us no reason to doubt that the plain and\nordinary meaning of the \u201cknowingly\u201d element of section 1320d-6 is the correct\none. Nor is it proper to apply here the exception to the usual meaning of \u201cknowingly\u201d exemplified by Liparota. See id., 471 U.S. at 424\u201328. Liparota is the case cited\nby the Supreme Court in Bryan as an example of the exception to the rule\u2014when\n\u201cthe text of the statute dictates a different result\u201d\u2014that \u201cknowingly\u201d refers to the\nfacts that constitute the offense and not to the law.",

Bryan, 524 U.S. at 193 & n.15. In Liparota, the Supreme Court held that a statute forbidding fraudulent use of\nfood stamps required proof of knowledge that the use was unauthorized. 471 U.S.\nat 433. The statute in that case read: \u201cwhoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires,\nalters, or possesses coupons or authorization cards in any manner not authorized\nby this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter\u201d shall be guilty of\na criminal offense. Id. at 420\u201321 n.1 (quoting 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(b)(1)).

Finally, the concern expressed in Liparota about criminalizing a broad\nswath of seemingly innocent conduct is less present here. The statute in Liparota\ncriminalized the unauthorized use of food stamps by any participant in the\nprogram, as well as by any person who might come in possession of these stamps. 471 U.S. at 426\u201327. In contrast, section 1320d-6, as we conclude above, applies\ndirectly to covered entities. These covered entities\u2014health plans, health care\nclearinghouses, certain health care providers, and Medicare prescription drug card\nsponsors\u2014are likely well aware that the health care business they conduct is\nheavily regulated by HIPAA and other laws. To the extent that some concern\nremains, it is insufficient to override the plain meaning of the statute. Accordingly,\nLiparota provides no support for giving \u201cknowingly\u201d in section 1320d-6 a\nmeaning different from its usual understanding as referring only to knowledge of\nthe facts that constitute the offense. III. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that covered entities and those persons\nrendered accountable by general principles of corporate criminal liability may be\nprosecuted directly under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-6 and that the \u201cknowingly\u201d element\nof the offense set forth in that provision requires only proof of knowledge of the\nfacts that constitute the offense.
