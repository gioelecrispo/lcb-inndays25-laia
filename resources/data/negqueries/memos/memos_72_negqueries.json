December 18, 1995\nM e m o r a n d u m O p in io n f o r t h e C o u n s e l t o t h e P r e s id e n t On April 25, 1995, President Clinton nominated Mr. William A. Fletcher to\nbe a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See 141\nCong. Rec. 11,243 (1995). While Mr. Fletcher\u2019s nomination has been pending\nbefore the United States Senate, questions have arisen as to whether his appoint\u00ad\nment would violate 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 because Mr. Fletcher\u2019s mother, the Honorable\nBetty B. Fletcher, has served as a judge on the same court since her appointment\nin 1979. Section 458 of title 28 provides as follows: \u201c No person shall be\nappointed to or employed in any office or duty in any court who is related by\naffinity or consanguinity within the degree of first cousin to any justice or judge\no f such court.\u201d We have previously opined that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7458 does not apply to presidential\nappointments of judges to the federal judiciary. See Memorandum for Eleanor\nD. Acheson, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Policy Development, from\nRichard L. Shiffrin, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel,\nRe: Applicability o f 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments o f Federal\nJudges (Mar. 13, 1995). In light o f subsequent questions, you have asked whether\nwe adhere to that position. For the reasons that follow, we do. A\nTwo bedrock principles of statutory construction guide our analysis. First, \u201c we\nstart, as we must, with the language of the statute.\u201d Bailey v. United States, 516\nU.S. 137, 144 (1995). Second, \u201c the meaning of statutory language, plain or not,\ndepends on context.\u201d 1 Id. at 145. In this case, the particularly relevant constitu\u00ad\nents o f context upon which statutory meaning depends are the constitutional\nframework within which all statutes are drafted and enacted, see, e.g., Gregory\nv. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (stating principle that statutes be read to\nprotect \u201c the usual constitutional balance\u201d of power), the statutory language taken\nas a whole, see, e.g., King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 221 (1991) (stating\n1 As Learned Hand explained, \u201c words are n o t pebbles in alien juxtaposition; they have only a communal existence;\nand not only does the meaning o f each interpenetrate the other, but all in their aggregate take their [meaning] from\nthe setting in which they are used.\u201d NLRB v.

      "content": "350 Application o f 28 U.S.C. \u00a7458 to Presidential Appointments o f Federal Judges the \u201c cardinal rule\u201d that a \u201c statute is to be read as a whole\u201d ), and the amendment\nhistory of the statute, see, e.g., Bailey, 516 U.S. at 144 (taking account of amend\u00ad\nment history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) to determine the meaning of the word\n\u201c use\u201d ). Based on our review, we conclude that the plain meaning o f the statute\nprecludes its application to presidential appointments to the federal judiciary. We begin, as indicated, with the language of the statute. The current language\nof \u00a7458 was adopted in 1911,2 amending a statute originally enacted in 1887.3\nQuoting the language again, \u00a7458 in its current form provides that: \u201c No person\nshall be appointed to or employed in any office or duty in any court who is related\nby affinity or consanguinity within the degree of first cousin to any justice or\njudge of such court.\u201d The statute does not by its express terms apply to the Presi\u00ad\ndent, nor does it expressly ijame judgeships as one of the offices to which a related\nperson may not be appointed. We believe that the inapplicability of this provision\nto presidential appointments of federal judges is conclusively established by the\ntext of this provision, the history of its amendment, and the text of the Act of\n1911 taken as a whole. We elaborate on these reasons in Parts II and III of this\nmemorandum, which to a considerable degree recapitulate the analysis contained\nin our earlier memorandum. Before revisiting these points, however, in this part\nwe analyze a feature of the constitutional framework within which statutes must\nbe read that, in our view, also dictates the conclusion that \u00a7458 does not apply\nto presidential appointments of federal judges, even if the text and its textual his\u00ad\ntory did not conclusively establish the point. Any argument that \u00a7458 does apply to presidential appointments of federal\njudges depends entirely upon the fact that, while the statute refers to positions\nto which related persons may not be appointed, it makes no mention at all of\nthe appointing authority, worded as it is in the passive voice. In this context,\nhowever, this silence must lead to just the opposite conclusion, because of the\nwell-settled principle that statutes that do not expressly apply to the President\nmust be construed as not applying to the President if such application would\ninvolve a possible conflict with the President\u2019s constitutional prerogatives. See,\ne.g., Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 801 (1992). We can refer to this\nprinciple as a clear statement rule, one that is very well-established and that dic\u00ad\ntates the plain meaning of \u00a7 458. Then-Assistant Attorney General William H. Rehnquist articulated this principle\nwithout limiting it to cases in which application of the statute would raise a con\u00ad\nstitutional question, opining that statutes \u201c are construed not to include the Presi\u00ad\ndent unless there is a specific indication that Congress intended to cover the Chief\nExecutive.\u201d",

Even if this unquali\u00ad\nfied statement o f the principle is overly broad, the narrower formulation given\nabove clearly covers \u00a7458, because its application to presidential appointments\nto the federal judiciary would raise serious constitutional questions regarding the\nPresident\u2019s authority under the Appointments Clause, U.S. Const, art. II, \u00a7 2 , cl.\n2, as we explain below. Therefore, under the precedents of the Supreme Court\nas well as of the Department o f Justice, \u00a7458 may not be read as applying to\npresidential appointments. The principle that general statutes must be read as not applying to the President\nif they do not expressly apply where application would arguably limit the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s constitutional role has two sources. First, it is a long-recognized \u201c cardinal\nprinciple\u201d o f statutory interpretation that statutes be construed to avoid raising\nserious constitutional questions. See, e.g., Crowell v; Benson, 285 U.S. 22 (1932). This canon of statutory construction is a cornerstone of judicial restraint in that\nit \u2018 \u2018not only reflects the prudential concern that constitutional issues not be need\u00ad\nlessly confronted, but also recognizes that Congress, like this Court, is bound by\nand swears an oath to uphold the Constitution.\u201d Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.\nFlorida Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988). The canon is equally applicable to executive branch interpretations. Appropriations\nLimitation fo r Rules Vetoed by Congress, 4B Op. O.L.C. 731, 732 n.3 (1980). The second source is the constitutional principle o f separation of powers. The\nfundamental device by which the framers sought to prevent tyranny was the divi\u00ad\nsion of power to prevent an excessive accumulation in any single repository. Thus,\nthe Constitution divides power between the federal and the state governments as\nwell as among the federal government\u2019s three coordinate and independent\nbranches. See Gregory, 501 U.S. at 458. The clear statement rule exists in order\nto protect \u201c th[is] \u2018usual constitutional balance\u2019 \u201d of power. See id. at 460 (quoting\nWill v.

Given the central position that\nthe doctrines of federalism and separation of powers occupy in the Constitution\u2019s\ndesign, this rule also serves to \u201c assure[] that the legislature has in fact faced,\nand intended to bring into issue, the critical matters\u201d of the balance of power\namong the three branches of the federal government, in the context of separation\nof powers, and between the federal and state governments, in the context of fed\u00ad\neralism. See Gregory, 501 U.S. at 461; United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349\n(1971). This clear statement rule has been applied frequently by the Supreme Court\nas well as the executive branch with respect to statutes that might otherwise be 352 . Application o f 28 U.S.C. \u00a7458 to Presidential Appointments o f Federal Judges susceptible of an application that would affect the President\u2019s constitutional\nprerogatives, were one to ignore the constitutional context. For instance, in\nFranklin the Court was called upon to determine whether the Administrative\nProcedure Act (\u201c APA\u201d ), 5 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7701-706, authorized \u201c abuse of discretion\u201d\nreview of final actions by the President. The APA authorizes review of final\nactions by \u201c agencies,\u201d which it defines as \u201c each authority of the Government\nof the United States.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(b)(1). From this definition, the APA\nexpressly exempts Congress, the courts, the territories, and the District of\nColumbia government\u2014 but not the President. Even though the statute defined agency in a way that could include the President\nand did not list the President among the express exceptions to the APA, Justice\nO\u2019Connor wrote for the Court:\n[t]he President is not [expressly] excluded from the APA\u2019s purview,\nbut he is not explicitly included, either. Out of respect for the sepa\u00ad\nration of powers and the unique constitutional position of the Presi\u00ad\ndent, we find that textual silence is not enough to subject the Presi\u00ad\ndent to the provisions of the APA. We would require an express\nstatement by Congress before assuming it intended the President\u2019s\nperformance of his statutory duties to be reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion. 505 U.S. at 800-01. To amplify, she continued, \u201c [a]s the APA does not expressly\nallow review of the President\u2019s actions, we must presume that his actions are\nnot subject to its requirements.\u201d Id. at 801. If anything, the case for reading the\nAPA provision as applying to the President was stronger than is the case with\nrespect to \u00a7458, because the APA contains a list of express exceptions to its\nbroad coverage and that list does not include the President.",

If anything, the case for reading the\nAPA provision as applying to the President was stronger than is the case with\nrespect to \u00a7458, because the APA contains a list of express exceptions to its\nbroad coverage and that list does not include the President. One might have con\u00ad\ntended that the omission of the President from a list o f persons excluded is suffi\u00ad\nciently clear evidence of a congressional decision to include him within the reach\nof the APA to alter the otherwise applicable rule of constitutional context. To\nthe contrary, however, the Court affirmed the principle that the inclusion of the\nPresident must be express. In a case that is closely analogous and that involves the President\u2019s appointment\npower, the Supreme Court held that the Federal Advisory Committee Act\n(\u201c FACA\u201d ), 5 U.S.C. app. \u00a72, does not apply to the judicial recommendation\npanels o f the American Bar Association because interpreting the statute as\napplying to them would raise serious constitutional questions relating to the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s constitutional authority to appoint federal judges. See Public Citizen v.\nUnited States D ep\u2019t o f Justice, 491 U.S. 440 (1989). The FACA imposes open\nmeeting and reporting requirements on advisory committees, which it defines to\nbe any committee or similar group that is \u201c utilized by one or more agencies, 353 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 19 in the interest o f obtaining advice or recommendations for the President.\u201d 5\nU.S.C. app. \u00a7 3(2)(c). Two public interest groups, Public Citizen and the Wash\u00ad\nington Legal Foundation, sought to have FACA applied to the ABA judicial\nscreening committees. The Court unanimously rejected the public interest groups\u2019\nargument. The majority ruled that while a \u201c straightforward reading,\u201d Public Cit\u00ad\nizen, 491 U.S. at 453, o f FACA would seem to require its application to the ABA\ncommittee, the \u201c cardinal principle\u201d o f statutory interpretation that a statute be\ninterpreted to avoid serious constitutional question drove the majority to interpret\nFACA as not applying to the ABA committee. Id. at 465-67. Notably, the majority\nstated, \u201c [o]ur reluctance to decide constitutional issues is especially great where,\nas here, they concern the relative powers of coordinate branches of government,\u201d\nand \u201c [t]hat construing FACA to apply to the Justice Department\u2019s consultations\nwith the ABA Committee would present formidable constitutional difficulties is\nundeniable.\u201d 4 Id. at 466. A recent Supreme Court case that applied the clear statement rule in protecting\nthe constitutional separation of powers is Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, 509\nU.S. 155 (1993). This case dealt with the extraterritorial application of the Refugee\nAct.5 Prior to 1980, the act provided that the Attorney General was \u201c authorized\nto withhold deportation of any alien within the United States\u201d who was a refugee.6 In 1980, the statute was amended to delete the \u201c within the United States\u201d lan\u00ad\nguage and to make it mandatory that the Attorney General not deport the refugee. 7 The petitioners, an organization advocating on behalf of Haitian refugees, plau\u00ad\nsibly argued that, by deleting \u201c within the United States,\u201d Congress plainly meant\nto give the act extraterritorial application.

Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 902 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring). In addition to the numerous Supreme Court precedents,9 this Department has\nfrequently applied the clear statement rule in the context of the separation of\npowers between the executive and legislative branches. For example, we applied\nthis rule to a closely analogous question. We were asked whether the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7621-634 (\u201c ADEA\u201d ), prohibits\nthe President from considering the age of judicial candidates when determining\nwhom to nominate for federal judgeships. See Judges\u2014 Appointment\u2014 Age\nFactor, 3 Op. O.L.C. 388 (1979). We concluded that the ADEA should not be\nread to apply to the presidential appointment of federal judges: The power to appoint Federal judges, who hold office on good\nbehavior, is by tradition and design one of the most significant\npowers given by the Constitution to the President. It provides one\nof the few administrative mechanisms through which the President\ncan exert a long-term influence over the development and adminis\u00ad\ntration of law in the courts.

A former executive branch employee brought a variety o f claims against former President\nNixon arising from the em ployee's termination.

See Constraints\nImposed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a71913 on Lobbying Efforts, 13 Op. O.L.C. 300, 304-06\n(1989). The Anti-Lobbying Act prohibits any appropriated funds from being \u201c used\ndirectly or indirectly to pay for any personal service, advertisement, telegram, tele\u00ad\nphone, letter, printed or written matter, or other device, intended or designed to\ninfluence in any manner a Member of Congress.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913. The statute\nprovided an exception for communications by executive branch officers and\nemployees if the communication was made pursuant to a request by a member\nof Congress or was a request to Congress for legislation or appropriations. Assist\u00ad\nant Attorney General Barr concluded that applying the Act as broadly as its terms\nmight otherwise allow would raise serious constitutional questions as an infringe\u00ad\nment of the President\u2019s Recommendations Clause power. It is also the long-standing position of the Department of Justice that 18 U.S.C\n\u00a7208 does not apply to the President. That statute prohibits any \u201c officer or\nemployee of the executive branch\u201d from \u201c participat[ing] personally and substan\u00ad\ntially\u201d in any particular matter in which he or she has a personal financial interest. Id. In the leading opinion on the matter, then-Deputy Attorney General Laurence\nSilberman first determined that the legislative history disclosed no intention to\ncover the President and doing so would raise \u201c [s]ome doubt . . . as to the con\u00ad\nstitutionality\u2019 \u2019 of the statute, because the effect o f applying the statute to the Presi\u00ad\ndent would be to impose a qualification on his serving as President.

We concluded that, \u201c because o f the gravity of the constitutional\nquestions [a requirement to ignore the age of potential nominees] raises, we would\nbe most reluctant to construe any statute as an attempt to regulate the President\u2019s\nchoice in that way.\u201d Id. at 389.

That result is further supported by every available piece of contempora\u00ad\nneous, extra-statutory evidence of the understanding of members o f Congress, as\nwell as by a consistent practice of non-application of the statute to the appointment\nof federal judges. In this part, we discuss the meaning of \u00a7458 as it might be\nascertained on the face of the statutes themselves, without reference to the clear\nstatement principle. In the subsequent part, we review the contemporaneous\ncongressional understandings of the statute\u2019s meaning. Finally, we review some\nof the instances in which related persons within the meaning of the statute have\nbeen appointed to the federal bench by the President. As indicated earlier, the present statute appears to have originated as Act of\nMar. 3, 1887, ch. 373, \u00a77, 24 Stat. 552, 555.

Id. (emphasis added). In that version, the statute referred specifically to appoint\u00ad\nments by the courts or judges, and could not be understood to encompass presi\u00ad\ndential appointments as well. In our constitutional scheme, judicial appointments\nare not made by judges, but rather have always been vested in the President with\nthe advice and consent of the Senate. The statute was next codified as Act of Aug. 13, 1888, ch. 866, \u00a77, 25 Stat. 433, 437. In that form too, it prohibited only the appointment of any person related\nto any federal justice or judge within the degree of first cousin \u201c by such court\nor judge.\u201d This provision was repealed by the Act o f Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, \u00a7297, 36\nStat. 1087, 1168.13 The language substituted for the repealed provision did not,\nin terms, refer only to appointment \u201c by such court or judge.\u201d Instead, it stated: No person shall be appointed to or employed in any office or duty\nin any court who is related by affinity or consanguinity within the\ndegree o f first cousin to the judge of such court.

Moreover, contemporaneous and near contemporaneous evidence of Congress\u2019s\nown understanding clearly substantiates that Congress did not intend to extend\nthe scope of the earlier prohibition to include judicial appointments by the Presi\u00ad\ndent. Section 297 of the Act of Mar. 3, 1911, was to go into effect on January\n1, 1912, abolishing the circuit courts and causing the district courts to succeed\nthem, so that clerks would have to be appointed for the district courts. Shortly\nbefore the law went into effect, it was pointed out in Congress that these changes\n\u201c would prevent any man who is related within certain degree by affinity or con\u00ad\nsanguinity to the district judge from being appointed clerk.\u201d 48 Cong. Rec. 309\n(1911) (remarks of Rep. Clayton). Thus, even incumbents who had not been\nappointed to circuit court clerkships by judicial relatives would be ineligible to\nbe appointed to clerkships in the succeeding district courts if it happened that\ntheir close relatives sat on those district courts. Several members of Congress\nobjected to that unforeseen and unintended outcome. Legislation was introduced,\nand eventually adopted, to \u201cgrandfather in\u201d such incumbents. 15 In the course of the House debate on this amendatory measure, several members\nadverted to the prohibition of the then-recent prior law. Congressman Mann\ndescribed section 297 as \u201c providing that the judge o f the Federal court shall not\nbe permitted to appoint his first cousin an officer o f the court . . . . It should\nbe the policy of the country to uphold the dignity o f the Federal bench, to guard\nagainst the possibility o f favoritism on the part o f the judges because of close\nkinship.\u201d 48 Cong. Rec. at 310 (remarks of Rep. Mann) (emphasis added). Simi\u00ad\nlarly, in colloquy, Mr. Hardy asked if the proposed amendment \u201c opposes the\nappointment o f relatives by public officials?\u201d , and Mr. Bartlett, referring to sec\u00ad\ntion 297, responded that \u201c [t]he original section, I apprehend, had that purpose\nin view.\u201d Id. Plainly, then, the members of the House interested in the amendment\nin the December 1911 debate understood that the March 1911 enactment had only\nrestricted the power o f judges to appoint their near kin to positions with their\ncourts.",

Plainly, then, the members of the House interested in the amendment\nin the December 1911 debate understood that the March 1911 enactment had only\nrestricted the power o f judges to appoint their near kin to positions with their\ncourts. Although these remarks occurred after the enactment of section 297, they\nwere made only a few months after that section had become law, and thus provide\nuseful evidence of what the enacting Congress intended by it. Later codifications carried forward the language adopted in 1911, with changes\nnot relevant here. See Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, \u00a7458, 62 Stat. 869, 908;\n15 See Act o f Dec. 21, 1911, ch. 4, 37 Stat. 46 ( \u201c [N]o such person at present holding a position or employment\nin a circuit court shall be debarred from sim ilar appointment or em ployment in the district court succeeding to\nsuch circuit court jurisdiction.\u201d ). 362 Application o f 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments o f Federal Judges H.R. Rep. No. 80-308, at A55 (1947). In light of this legislative history, we see\nno reason to suppose that Congress ever intended to do more than to make fully\neffective the original prohibition against nepotistical appointments by judges, and\nthat the sole function of the change of 1911 was to close a loophole in the original\nstatutory scheme. rv\nFinally, we note that the consistent practice since the present version of \u00a7458\nwas enacted in 1911 has been to construe the statute as not applying to presidential\nappointments. On at least three occasions since 1911, the President has appointed\nand the Senate has confirmed relatives within the statutory degree of consanguinity\nto the same court. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson, just three years after\nthe enactment of \u00a7458 in its present form, appointed Augustus Hand to be a\nDistrict Judge for the Southern District of New York, even though his first cousin,\nLearned Hand, had been a District Judge of that court since 1909. In 1927, Presi\u00ad\ndent Coolidge elevated Judge Augustus Hand to be a Circuit Judge on the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, even though Judge Learned Hand\nhad been appointed to that court three years earlier. More recently, in 1992, Presi\u00ad\ndent Bush appointed and the Senate confirmed Judge Morris Arnold to be a Circuit\nJudge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, although his\nbrother, Judge Richard Arnold, was already a member of that body. In addition, if the practical construction of \u00a7458 by the President and the Senate\nwere to hold that it applies to presidential appointments, there would be a signifi\u00ad\ncant question as to the validity of a number of appointments where one relative\nserved on an appeals court while another served on a district court. Specifically,\nit is not clear whether, for purposes of \u00a7458, a district court is a component\nof the court of appeals for the circuit in which the district is located. Most recently,\nDiana Motz was confirmed and appointed to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit in 1994, while her husband, Frederick Motz, was a judge\nfor the District of Maryland.",

We are not aware of anyone ever proposing that \u00a7458 applies to presidential\nappointments of federal judges. In this light, applying \u00a7458 to presidential\nappointments of federal judges would represent a novel construction of the statute. We do not reject this construction, however, because it is novel. We reject it\nbecause it is contrary to the statute\u2019s language, structure, and purpose, as well\nas the consistent practice under that statute from the date of its enactment.
