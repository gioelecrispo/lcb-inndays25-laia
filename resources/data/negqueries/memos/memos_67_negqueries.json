Section 207(a) prohibits former federal gov\u00ad\nernment employees, including employees of the District of Columbia govern\u00ad\nment, from representing \u201cany other person (except the United States)\u201d in matters\non which the employee worked as a government employee. For the reasons set\nforth below, we conclude that section 207(a) poses no bar to the former em\u00ad\nployee\u2019s communicating with the District government because USRC should be\nregarded as \u201cthe United States\u201d for purposes of that statute. In the past, we have looked to the definition of \u201cagency of the United States\u201d\nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6 to determine if an entity should be regarded as the United States\nfor the purposes of the conflict of interest laws. See Applicability o f 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 205 to Union Organizing Activities o f Department o f Justice Employee, 5 Op.\nO.L.C. 194 (1981) (Office of the Architect of the Capitol an agency of the United\nStates for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 205); Letter for the Secretary of the Army,\nfrom Attorney General Clark (Dec. 2, 1948) (Panama Railroad Company an\nagency of the United States for purposes of the conflict of interest laws). Section\n6 provides: The term \u201cagency\u201d includes any department, independent es\u00ad\ntablishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bu\u00ad\nreau of the United States or any corporation in which the United\nStates has a proprietary interest, unless the context shows that such\nterm was intended to be used in a more limited sense. 84 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6. The legislative history of the provision adds: The phrase \u201ccorporation in which the United States has a pro\u00ad\nprietary interest\u201d is intended to include those governmental cor\u00ad\nporations in which stock is not actually issued, as well as those in\nwhich stock is owned by the United States. It excludes those cor\u00ad\nporations in which the interest of the Government is custodial or\nincidental.",

A6 (1947) (revisers\u2019 notes reprinted in\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6). Few judicial precedents are available to guide us in interpreting 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 6, and none of those involve corporations similar to USRC.' In his 1948 letter\nto the Secretary of the Army, supra, the Attorney General concluded that the\nPanama Railroad Company was an agency of the United States under 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 6. Although he did not explain what factors led to that conclusion, an exami\u00ad\nnation of the status of the Panama Railroad Company in 1948 reveals several rel\u00ad\nevant considerations. Under the Act of June 29, 1948, 62 Stat. 1075, 1076-80,\nthe Panama Railroad Company was \u201can agency and instrumentality of the United\nStates,\u201d funded by congressional appropriations and transfers from other gov\u00ad\nernment agencies, with the responsibility for operating a railroad across the\nPanamanian Isthmus and for building and maintaining the infrastructure of the\nCanal Zone. More helpful is the discussion of the definition of \u201cagency of the United States\u201d\nin this Office\u2019s opinion finding the Federal National Mortgage Association\n(\u201cFNMA\u201d) an agency of the United States for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 431. Section 431, another conflict of interest provision, prohibits Members of Con\u00ad\ngress from entering into contracts with agencies of the United States. In a mem\u00ad\norandum for Joseph F. Dolan, Assistant Deputy Attorney General, from Norbert\nA. Schlei, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (Dec. 18, 1963)\n(\u201cSchlei Memorandum\u201d), we concluded that the status of the FNMA as an agency\nof the United States precluded the FNMA\u2019s representation by a law firm of which\na Congressman was a member. We examined the charter of the FNMA and de\u00ad\ntermined that it was a \u201ccorporation in which the United States has a proprietary\ninterest.\u201d Id. at 3. In making this determination we took into account the follow\u00ad\ning factors: 1) the corporation was created by federal statute; 2) one of the\nFNMA\u2019s functions was \u201cto provide Government assistance for certain types of\nmortgages\u201d; 3) the FNMA was a mixed-ownership corporation in which the Sec\u00ad\nretary of the Treasury owned the preferred stock; and 4) the United States exer\u00ad\ncised substantial control over the FNM A\u2019s activities. Id. at 4\u20146. 1\nCompare United States v Allen, 193 F. Supp. 954,957 (S D. Cal. 1961) (a federal grand jury is not an agency\nof the United States) with United States v. Stark, 131 F. Supp. 190, 194 (D. Md. 1955) (the FBI is an agency o f the\nUnited States). Neither o f these cases suggests any standards that can be used to decide whether a particular cor\u00ad\nporate entity should be regarded as an \u201cagency o f the United States\" under the statute. 85 Based upon these precedents, we believe that USRC should be regarded as an\nagency of the United States for purposes of title 18 if the interest of the United\nStates in the corporation is \u201cproprietary,\u201d but not if the interest of the United\nStates is \u201ccustodial or incidental.\u201d",

Congress anticipated that \u201ca nonprofit, public-private development cor\u00ad\nporation\u201d could be created to manage the redevelopment of the Union Station\ncomplex. S. Rep. No. 269, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1981), reprinted in 1981\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2711,2723. USRC \u201cwas formed to assist the Secretary in achiev\u00ad\ning the objectives of the Redevelopment Act and generally to facilitate the rede\u00ad\nvelopment o f the Union Station complex.\u201d Union Station Redevelopment Coop\u00ad\nerative Agreement at 3 (Nov. 1983) (\u201cUnion Station Agreement\u201d). In particular,\nUSRC\u2019s responsibilities include selecting and monitoring the developer of the\nstation complex, ensuring that adequate provision is afforded Amtrak for its cur\u00ad\nrent and future use of the station, and working with other interested parties in the\nredevelopment of the station. Id. at 6-7. Although these functions presumably\ncould be handled by private enterprise without federal control, that is not an ad\u00ad\nequate basis for finding that an entity is not an agency of the United States. See\nRauscher, 789 F.2d at 315. See also Schlei Memorandum at 5 (FNMA is an\nagency of the United States even though it is empowered \u201cto engage in its busi\u00ad\nness activities in a manner comparable to that of private institutions engaged in\nsimilar activities\u201d). In this case, Congress assigned USRC\u2019s responsibilities to\nthe Department of Transportation. USRC is simply the vehicle created by that\nDepartment to accomplish the congressional mandate. USRC is financed by several sources. Amtrak is obligated to provide up to sev\u00ad\nenty million dollars to USRC for the redevelopment project. Union Station Agree\u00ad 2\nTerry construed the meaning of \u201cagency\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 451, which defines \u201cagency\u201d in a manner similar\nto the definition in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6. Moreover, the historical and revisions notes o f section 451 state that \u201cagency\u201d in\nsection 451 conform s to the definition of \u201c agency\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6. Accordingly, the court in Terry used the dis\u00ad\ncussion o f \u201cproprietary corporation\" in the revisers\u2019 notes to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6 to determine if Ginnie Mae should be\nheld an agency o f the United States for the'purposes o f determining federal jurisdiction See 608 F.2d at 618-20\n(G innie Mae is an agency because of the control HUD exercises over Ginnie Mae, the intent o f Congress to retain\ngovernm ental control over the federal housing program, and the funds provided by\u2014 and profits returned by Gin\u00ad\nnie M ae to\u2014 the federal government).",

Mich. 1987) (a federal land bank is not an agency because being chartered by and reg\u00ad\nulated by the federal government is not sufficient to make an entity an agency of the United States). A lthough title 28 incorporates the definition o f agency in title 18, the converse is not true. It is possible that\ndifferent considerations influence whether an agency should be considered part of the United States for jurisdic\u00ad\ntional purposes and w hether an agency is part of the United States for the purpose of defining a criminal offense. Thus, cases decided under title 28 are not dispositive under title 18, but they are useful in examining the factors that\ncourts have found relevant to deciding w hether an entity is an \u201cagency\u201d o f the United States. 86 ment at 8.3 The Federal Railroad Administration (\u201cFRA\u201d), an agency within the\nDepartment of Transportation, was required to provide $340,000 for the opera\u00ad\ntion and maintenance of Union Station between October 1, 1983 and September\n30, 1984; the FRA has a continuing obligation to provide financial assistance to\nUSRC to the extent that its funds are available for this purpose.

Id.\nat 7.\nUSRC is managed by a five member board of directors.

Several justifi\u00ad\ncations for the restrictions imposed by that section on post-government employ\u00ad\nment have been advanced: the need to prevent the use of confidential govern\u00ad\nment information for the benefit of a private party, the unseemliness of switching\nsides, the fear of undue influence over former colleagues, avoidance of pressure\non government employees who anticipate future private employment, and pro\u00ad\ntection from the appearance of a conflict of interest. See, e.g., Bayless Manning,\nFederal Conflict of Interest Law 179-81 (1964) (reviewing the legislative his\u00ad\ntory of the predecessor statute to section 207). See also ABA Comm, on Ethics\nand Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 342 (1975).

Nonetheless, we have advised that\nAmtrak is an \u201cagency\u201d for the purposes o f the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, because Amtrak is a \u201cGovernment\ncontrolled corporation\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(e). Letter for William M. Nichols, General Counsel, Office of M an\u00ad\nagement and Budget, from Antonin Scalia, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (Oct. 7, 1976)\nFurther, more than one-third o f Amtrak\u2019s total expenses for fiscal year 1987 was funded by congressional appro\u00ad\npriations.

Thus, for example, it would be entirely permissible\nfor an individual to work on the redevelopment of Union Station as an employee\nof the District of Columbia and then work on the same matter as an employee of\nthe Department of Transportation. We believe that the nature of USRC, as the\nentity performing the statutory responsibilities of the Department of Transporta\u00ad\ntion for the Union Station project, under the guidance of government officials\nand with the assistance of federal funding, suggests that the same result should\nbe reached when an individual moves from employment with the District of Co\u00ad\nlumbia to employment with USRC. In sum, we believe that the exclusively federal functions of USRC, and the sig\u00ad\nnificant control over its operations exercised by the federal government, warrant\nthe conclusion that USRC should be considered \u201cthe United States\u201d for the pur\u00ad\nposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a).
