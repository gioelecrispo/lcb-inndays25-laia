The Tenth Amendment limits Congress\u2019 power to enact legislation w hich interferes with\nthe traditional way in which local governm ents have arranged their affairs; moreover,\nprinciples of federalism limit Congress\u2019 pow er to require state officers to perform\nfederal functions. Historically, Congress has been reluctant to require states to house federal prisoners,\nalthough it is not clear w hether this reluctance has been motivated by a belief that\nCongress lacked power to do so by political considerations. A statutory scheme by which Congress would induce, rather than coerce, the states to\nhouse federal prisoners through exercise of its spending pow er is more likely to be held\nconstitutional, although here too there are limits on Congress\u2019 pow er to impose coer\u00ad\ncive conditions on the states\u2019 receipt o f federal funds. May 18, 1981\nMEMORANDUM OPINION FOR\nTH E ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY GENERAL This responds to your request for an opinion whether Congress\nwould have the authority under the Constitution to enact legislation\nrequiring state and local jail authorities to lodge federal pre-trial detain\u00ad\nees for a fee to be established either by regulation or agreement. We are\nconcerned that recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court make it\nmore likely than not that the courts would hold such legislation to be\ntoo intrusive on the states\u2019 sovereignty and therefore unconstitutional\nunder the Tenth Amendment. We suggest you consider devising a\nlegislative scheme which would induce, rather than coerce, the states to\noffer their facilities to house federal pre-trial detainees. There is no question that Congress has the power under the Constitu\u00ad\ntion to provide for the housing of federal pre-trial detainees\u2014whether\nby authorizing the construction of dentention facilities or arranging\nwith the states to use their facilities. E x parte Karstendick, 93 U.S. (3\nOtto) 396, 400 (1876). Although this power is not expressly enumerated\nin Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Constitution, the exercise of such power is\nnecessary and proper, under Article I, \u00a7 8, clause 18, to provide for an\n142 orderly federal system of criminal justice contemplated by several other\nprovisions of the Constitution. See, e.g., Art. II, \u00a7 3; Art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 3;\nFifth Amendment; Sixth Amendment; Eighth Amendment. That power,\nhowever, does not necessarily authorize Congress to require unwilling\nstates to provide facilities to house federal pre-trial detainees, because\nthe Supreme Court has recognized that Congress\u2019 exercise of its consti\u00ad\ntutional power is limited by the Tenth Amendment. The landmark case discussing the Tenth Amendment\u2019s limitations on\nCongress\u2019 exercise of its constitutional powers is National League o f\nCities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976). In National League o f Cities, the\nCourt addressed the question whether Congress, in exercising its power\nunder the Commerce Clause, could extend coverage of the Fair Labor\nStandards",

      "content": "In National League o f Cities, the\nCourt addressed the question whether Congress, in exercising its power\nunder the Commerce Clause, could extend coverage of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act to employees of the states and their political subdivi\u00ad\nsions, thus requiring the states to adhere to minimum wage and maxi\u00ad\nmum hour requirements previously applicable only to private employ\u00ad\ners. While recognizing that Congress has the power under the Com\u00ad\nmerce Clause to impose such restrictions on private employers, the\nCourt held that the Tenth Amendment limits the exercise of otherwise\nplenary powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause when the\nexercise of those powers would impermissibly intrude upon traditional\nstate governmental functions: It is one thing to recognize the authority of Congress to\nenact laws regulating individual businesses necessarily\nsubject to the dual sovereignty of the government of the\nNation and of the State in which they reside. It is quite\nanother to uphold a similar exercise of congressional au\u00ad\nthority directed, not to private citizens, but to the States\nas States. We have repeatedly recognized that there are\nattributes of sovereignty attaching to every state govern\u00ad\nment which may not be impaired by Congress, not be\u00ad\ncause Congress may lack an affirmative grant of legisla\u00ad\ntive authority to reach the matter, but because the Consti\u00ad\ntution prohibits it from exercising the authority in that\nmanner. Id. at 845. The Court concluded that, since application of the Fair Labor Stand\u00ad\nards Act to employees of states and their political subdivisions would\n\u201csignificantly alter or displace the States\u2019 abilities to structure employee-employer relationships in such areas as fire prevention, police\nprotection, sanitation, public health, and parks and recreation,\u201d id. at\n851\u2014areas in which the states have traditionally provided services to\ntheir citizens\u2014Congress lacked authority to extend the coverage of the\nAct to such employees. In a concurring opinion, Justice Blackmun,\nwho joined the Court\u2019s opinion and whose vote was necessary to form\nthe Court majority, appeared to temper the Court\u2019s opinion by reading\n143 it to permit federal intrusion on state sovereignty \u201cwhere the federal\ninterest is demonstrably greater and where state facility compliance\nwith imposed federal standards would be essential.\u201d Id. at 856. Four\nJustices dissented from the Court\u2019s decision. In our view, regardless of whether the language of the Court\u2019s\nopinion is taken literally or whether the \u201cbalancing approach\u201d as articu\u00ad\nlated by Justice Blackmun is applied, the proposed legislation for man\u00ad\ndatory incarceration of federal pre-trial detainees in local detention\nfacilities would present serious problems under the Tenth Amendment. The opinion focuses on interference with local government policies and\ntraditional state governmental functions and the displacement of local\npolicy decisions. It is clear that the administration of a jail is a tradi\u00ad\ntional state governmental function. Wentworth v. Solem, 548 F.2d 773\n(8th Cir. 1977). Cf. Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 486 (1969) (\u201cThere\nis no doubt that discipline and administration of state detention facilities\nare state functions. They are subject to federal authority only where\nparamount federal constitutional or statutory rights supervene.\u201d). Meachum v.

In reaching our conclusion, we recognize that it could be argued that\nN ational League o f Cities is not applicable to the proposal in question\nhere because the proposed legislation, assuming that it would not also\ndirect the states in the administration of their pre-trial detention facili\u00ad\nties, would not directly usurp the decisionmaking functions of the states\nin the administration of their prison facilities. We are not convinced,\nhowever, that legislation must directly supplant state decisionmaking to\nrun afoul of the principles of National League o f Cities. It is clear from\nthe opinion that the Court was concerned primarily with the effect of\nlegislation on \u201cthe traditional ways in which the local governments\nhave arranged their affairs.\u201d 426 U.S. at 849. If, as noted in your\nrequest, this legislation is necessary because state and local governments\nare refusing to continue contracting to house federal pre-trial detainees\nbecause of overcrowding, a requirement that they provide facilities,\nregardless of the overcrowding of state and local facilities, may force\nthe states, even with some statutory fee provided, to reallocate their\nfacilities or at worst either to detain fewer persons or to construct more\ndetention facilities. 1 The proposed legislation might then be regarded as\ninterfering substantially, though arguably less directly than the legisla\u00ad\ntion invalidated in National League o f Cities, with the states\u2019 administra\u00ad\ntion of their prison facilities. 1 T he states, with already crowded facilities, would be placed in a particularly difficult position by\nthe proposed legislation because, unless they acted to relieve any overcrowding caused by housing\nfederal pre-trial detainees, they could be found by a federal court to have denied the detainees due\nprocess and ordered to eliminate the overcrowding. See Campbell v. Cauthron, 623 F.2d 503 (8th Cir.\n1980). See also Bel/ v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). 144 Moreover, under Justice Blackmun\u2019s balancing test, the intrusion may\nbe less justifiable than the intrusion held to be impermissible in National\nLeague o f Cities. The federal interest served by the proposed legislation\nappears to be primarily that of saving the cost to the federal govern\u00ad\nment of constructing and administering pre-trial detention facilities for\nits detainees. In cities where there are relatively few federal detainees,\nit would obviously be more efficient to use existing state facilities than\nto construct new federal facilities. That interest, however, does not\nseem to be \u201cdemonstrably greater\u201d than the state interest in avoiding\nfurther overcrowding of its facilities so as to justfy the intrusion. There is also a line of cases decided prior to National League o f Cities\nwhich suggests that this proposal could be considered as far more\nintrusive than imposing wage and hour restrictions on state govern\u00ad\nments because it imposes an affirmative obligation on the states and\ntheir subdivisions to perform a federal function.",

Dennison, 65 U.S. (24 How.) 66, 107 (1860), the Supreme Court held\nthat, while Congress may delegate the performance of federal functions\nto state officers, the principles of federalism deprive Congress of the\npower to require state officers to perform such functions: Indeed such a power would place every State under the\ncontrol and dominion of the General Government, even\nin the administration of its internal concerns and reserved\nrights. A nd we think it clear, that the Federal Government,\nunder the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State\nofficer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to\nperform it; for if it possessed this power, it might overload the officer with duties which would fill up all his time,\nand disable him from performing his obligations to the\nState, and might impose on him duties of a character\nincompatible with the rank and dignity to which he was\nelevated by the State. 65 U.S at 107-108 (emphasis added).

In a series of court of appeals decisions criticizing regulations pro\u00ad\nmulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which\nwould have required states to enact statutes and to administer and\nenforce EPA programs, three circuit courts criticized those regulations\nas intruding upon state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amend\u00ad\nment.

Although PURPA is\ndifferent in several respects from the legislation proposed here, Supreme Court review of PURPA\nmay shed some light on the question o f what if any obligations to enforce federal law may be imposed\non the states.

Ed.] 146 states to house federal detainees. 5 When the federal government was\nfounded, it presumably would have been prohibitively expensive for the\nnew government to provide its own prison facilities to house federal\nprisoners scattered throughout the original 13 states. Congress dealt\nwith this problem not by requiring the states to make their facilities\navailable to the federal government, but by adopting a joint resolution\non September 23, 1789, recommending \u201cto the legislatures of the several\nStates to pass laws, making it expressly the duty of the keepers of their\ngaols, to receive and safe keep therein all prisoners committed under\nthe authority of the United States\u201d and authorizing payment to the\nstates for the use of their jails. 1 Stat. 96-97 (1789). The joint resolution\npassed both Houses of Congress without any recorded debate. 6 Thus,\nwe do not know whether the decision by the first Congress to recom\u00ad\nmend to the states that they permit the federal government to use their\nprison facilities, rather than requiring them to provide the facilities, was\nmotivated by a belief that Congress lacked the power to require the\nlatter or that the former was merely politically more acceptable. Congress\u2019 action in 1821, however, when some states apparently\nrefused to permit the federal government to continue to use their prison\nfacilities, lends some support to the inference that the early Congresses\nbelieved that they lacked the power to require the states to provide\nfacilities. From a joint resolution adopted by Congress in 1821,7 it\nappears that some states, having followed Congress\u2019 recommendation in\n1789 to permit the use of their prison facilities by the federal govern\u00ad\nment, subsequently decided to withdraw their permission. Congress\nresponded to that withdrawal, not by requiring the states to make their\nfacilities available to the federal government, but by authorizing the\nmarshal, in those states that had withdrawn their permission, to \u201chire a\nconvenient place to serve as a temporary jail, and to make the neces\u00ad\nsary provision for the safe keeping of prisoners committed under the\nauthority of the United States, until permanent provision shall be made\nby law for that purpose.\u201d 3 Stat. 646-47 (1821).

Again, there is nothing in the legislative history to\nindicate that Congress believed that it lacked power to require the\nrecalcitrant states to make their facilities available to the federal gov\u00ad\nernment; Congress may have been merely reluctant to exercise this\npower. Thus, we cannot conclude on the basis of this history that the\nTenth Amendment precludes such a requirement, but we believe it\nprovides some insight into the sensitive manner with which this issue\nhas been treated by Congress since the founding of our government. Therefore, while we cannot be certain that the proposed legislation\nwould be unconstitutional, we believe that it would raise a serious\nquestion under the Tenth Amendment whether Congress, on enacting\nsuch legislation, had impermissibly intruded upon the states\u2019 sover\u00ad\neignty.

Congress, by invoking its power under the Spending Clause, could\ncondition the availability of some grant program to individual states on\nthe cooperation of the states in providing detention facilities for federal\npre-trial detainees. Such legislation should, however, be carefully for\u00ad\nmulated because the Court has recently reaffirmed its warning that\n\u201c[t]here are limits on the power of Congress to impose conditions on\nthe States pursuant to its Spending Power.\u201d Pennhurst State School and\nH ospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 n. 13 (1981).8 However, if the\nlegislation is not coercive and would contemplate that the states would\nreceive benefits reflecting the incremental costs (including costs attrib\u00ad\nutable to administrative and capital costs) of housing the federal detain\u00ad\nees in state facilities, the burden and coercive effect on the states should\nnot be considered excessive and such legislation would probably be\nupheld. I would imagine that there are already federal subsidies to state\nprison facilities, and it might be feasible to condition receipt of a\nportion of such subsidies on the willingness to provide facilities (for\ncompensation) for federal pre-trial detainees. If you would like to 8 F or example, statutory inducements cannot be used as \u201c weapons of coercion, destroying or\nimpairing the autonomy of the states.\u201d Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 586 (1937) 148 consider such an approach, we will be happy to assist further with the\nformulation of such legislation. T h e o d o r e B.
