August 23, 1993 M O p in io n em orandum fo r th e A s s is t a n t D i r e c t o r , L e g a l C o u n s e l\nF ederal B u r ea u of I n v e s t ig a t io n This m em orandum responds to your request for our opinion whether \u00a7 406 of\nthe Federal Em ployees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (\u201cFEPCA\u201d), 104 Stat. 1427, 1467,1 preserves extraordinary benefits payable under \u00a7 601 o f the Intelli\u00ad\ngence A uthorization Act, Fiscal Y ear 1989, Pub. L. No. 100-453, 102 Stat. 1904,\n1911 (1988), as am ended by the Intelligence Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1990,\nPub. L. No. 101-193, \u00a7 601, 103 Stat. 1701, 1710 (1989), even after expiration of\n\u00a7 601 \u2019s paym ent authority. We conclude that \u00a7 406 does not preserve the \u00a7 601\nbenefits beyond the expiration of the latter provision. Section 601 establishes a demonstration project that attempts to improve re\u00ad\ncruitm ent and retention at the New Y ork Field Division (\u201cNYFD\u201d) of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) by increasing pay. See H.R. Rep. No. 100-591(1),\nat 11-12 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U .S.C.C.A.N. 2469, 2479-80. Pursuant to\n\u00a7 601, any FBI em ployee transferred to the NYFD receives a lump sum payment of\nup to $20,000, conditioned upon the em ployee\u2019s agreement to serve at least three\nyears in that office. \u00a7 601(a)(1). In addition, all employees in the NYFD receive\nperiodic bonus paym ents o f between 20 and 25% o f their basic pay for the period\ncovered by the bonus. \u00a7 601(a)(2). Section 601(b) provides that these benefits\nwill term inate after five years. We understand from you that the program will end\non Septem ber 30, 1993. FEPCA institutes a system of pay adjustments for general schedule employees\nthroughout the Federal government, including locality pay to accommodate the\nhigher cost o f living in certain areas. Under FEPCA, special agents in the NYFD\ncurrently receive a 16% increase over base pay to account for New Y ork\u2019s higher\ncost o f living. Sim ilarly, support staff who receive pay under the general schedule\n1\nFEPCA was enacted as \u00a7 529 of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations\nAct, 1991, Pub L. No. 101-509, 104 Stat. 1389 (1990).",

No. 101-509, 104 Stat. 1389 (1990). All references to provisions o f FEPCA in this\nmemorandum will cite the internal section num bers and corresponding pages in the statutes at large. 34 Construction o f \u00a7 406 o f the F E P C A ct o f 1990 receive an 8% increase. Support staff who receive pay under the federal wage\nsystem do not receive any increase. See FEPCA \u00a7\u00a7 101, 404, 104 Stat. at 1429-30,\n1466; Exec. Order No. 12786, Schedule 9, reprinted in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332 note\n(Supp. Ill 1991). Thus, \u00a7 601 and FEPCA each provide extra pay for NYFD employees (except\nfor wage employees who receive benefits under \u00a7 601 but not FEPCA). F E P C A \u2019s\n\u00a7 406, however, instructs the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cO PM \u201d) to coordi\u00ad\nnate the two programs to ensure that their payments are not cumulated:\nNotwithstanding [\u00a7601], as amended, the Office of Personnel\nM anagement shall reduce the rate of periodic payments under such\nsection as the provisions o f this Act [FEPCA] are implemented:\nProvided, That no such reduction results in a reduction of the total\npay for any employee o f the New York Field Division of the Fed\u00ad\neral Bureau of Investigation. Notwithstanding [\u00a7 601], the Office of\nPersonnel M anagement may make such periodic payments inappli\u00ad\ncable to employees newly appointed to, or transferred to, the New\nYork Field Division on or after January 1, 1992. The main clause in the first sentence of \u00a7 406 clearly does not authorize a con\u00ad\ntinuation of \u00a7 601 pay beyond the life of the demonstration project. On the con\u00ad\ntrary, it expressly directs OPM to reduce \u00a7 601 payments to NYFD employees as\nFEPCA is implemented. The second sentence of \u00a7 406 also contemplates the cur\u00ad\ntailing of \u00a7 601; it instructs that employees hired after January 1, 1992, need not\nreceive any \u00a7 601 benefits. Notwithstanding this general thrust o f \u00a7 406, it has been suggested that the pro\u00ad\nviso in the first sentence might be intended as independent authority to\n\u201cgrandfather\u201d current NYFD employees with continued extra pay at the \u00a7 601\nlevel. The suggestion is that the proviso forbids any reduction in the total pay o f\nNYFD employees as a result of a reduction in \u00a7 601 benefits. Since the term ina\u00ad\ntion of \u00a7 601 benefits will cause a decrease in the pay of NYFD em ployees\n(because FEPC A \u2019s benefits are lower and also do not extend to wage employees),\nit is urged that the proviso would prevent any reduction in pay by authorizing con\u00ad\ntinued pay at the \u00a7 601 level. This suggestion misconstrues the purpose o f the proviso. As indicated above,\nthe main clause o f \u00a7 406 directs OPM to reduce \u00a7 601 payments in response to\nFEPCA. That clause, however, does not specify by how much the payments are to\nbe reduced.",

That clause, however, does not specify by how much the payments are to\nbe reduced. It is the proviso that limits O PM \u2019s discretion in this regard. T he pro\u00ad\nviso precludes any reduction of \u00a7 601 benefits that \u201cresults in a reduction o f the\ntotal pay for any employee of the [NYFD].\u201d In effect, this means that OPM may\nnot reduce \u00a7 601 benefits by more than one dollar for every dollar introduced un\u00ad\nder FEPCA; if it did, an em ployee\u2019s total pay would be reduced, in violation o f the\n35 Opinions o f th e Office o f L eg a l Counsel proviso. Thus, for each reduction in \u00a7 601 paym ents implemented pursuant to the\nmain clause o f \u00a7 406, the proviso caps the reduction at the amount of FEPCA dol\u00ad\nlars that the em ployee receives, which prevents any net loss of pay. It m ust be understood that the proviso\u2019s protection applies only with respect to\nO PM \u2019s reduction o f \u00a7 601 benefits pursuant to \u00a7 406. This much is established by\nthe phrase, \u201cno such reduction,\u201d w hich unmistakably links the proviso\u2019s operation\nwith the preceding clause. See also 2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory\nConstruction \u00a7\u00a7 47.08-.09 (5th ed. 1992) (in general, a proviso should be strictly\nconstrued to relate to the enactment o f which it is part). In this case, the reduction\no f pay will occur as a result of the winding down o f \u00a7 601 \u2019s internal clock, and not\npursuant to \u00a7 406. Thus, the proviso will not be triggered. Accordingly, \u00a7 406\ncannot be said to authorize continued extra pay at the \u00a7 601 rate. 2 W ALTER DELLINGER\nA cting A ssistant Attorney General\nOffice o f Legal Counsel 2\nWe can find no references in the legislative history of FEPCA (nor were any presented to us) to suggest\nthat \u00a7 406 was intended to continue \u00a7 601 benefits beyond their natural span. 36",
