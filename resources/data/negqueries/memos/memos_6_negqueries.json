November 13, 1980\nMEMORANDUM OPINION FOR TH E SPECIAL ASSISTANT\nTO TH E PR ESID EN T FOR CONSUMER A FFA IRS This responds to your request for our opinion as to the scope of the\nexclusion of \u201cmedicine or medical supplies\u201d from export controls under\nthe Export Administration Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-72, 93 Stat. 503\n(1979), 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 2401 (Supp. Ill 1979). In pertinent part, the\nexclusion in \u00a7 6(0 of the Act reads:\n(0 Exclusion for Medicine and Medical Supplies\u2014 This section does not authorize export controls on medi\u00ad\ncine or medical supplies. It is the intent of Congress that\nthe President not impose export controls under this sec\u00ad\ntion on any goods or technology if he determines that the\nprincipal effect of the export of such goods or technology\nwould be to help meet basic human needs. This subsection\nshall not be construed to prohibit the President from\nimposing restrictions on the export of medicine or medical\nsupplies under the International Emergency Economic\nPowers Act. 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 2405(f). You have asked whether the exclusion is\nlimited to only those \u201cgoods or technology . . . the principal effect of\nwhich would be to help meet basic human needs\u201d; and, if so, what is\nmeant by the phrase \u201cbasic human needs\u201d; and how and by whom the\ndeterminations of exclusion are to be made. 809 I. The Scope of the Exclusion\nYour question concerning the scope o f the \u00a7 6(F) exclusion (actually,\nthe absence of authority to impose controls) arises because there is\ntension between the first and second sentences of the subsection as\nquoted above. The first sentence uses the phrase \u201cmedicine or medical\nsupplies\u201d in describing the goods and technology excluded from con\u00ad\ntrols, while the second sentence defines the exclusion in terms of a\nstandard of \u201cbasic human needs.\u201d Yet the Act defines neither phrase\nand does not otherwise indicate whether they are intended to have the\nsame meaning. Because of this ambiguity, there are two possible read\u00ad\nings of the effect of the two sentences together.",

      "content": "Yet the Act defines neither phrase\nand does not otherwise indicate whether they are intended to have the\nsame meaning. Because of this ambiguity, there are two possible read\u00ad\nings of the effect of the two sentences together. First, as you inquired, the second sentence could be read as limiting\nor further defining the first. Thus, although the first sentence seems to\nexclude from controls all medicine and medical supplies, the second\nsentence would limit the exclusion to medicine and medical supplies,\nthe principal effect of which would be to help meet basic human needs. Alternatively, the second sentence might be read as merely explaining\nthe basis for the absolute exclusion in the first sentence and would not\nimpose a strict standard of human need on the exclusion. The question\nis not free from doubt, but we conclude that the latter interpretation is\nthe better reading of the language of the subsection itself and is also\nmore consistent with the sparse legislative history of the exclusion. Initially, we note the interpretive problems that you suggested. As to\nthe statutory language itself, the first sentence, the only operative\nlanguage of the subsection, is phrased as an absolute exclusion. To read\nthe second sentence as a limitation on this absolute exclusion would\nhave the effect of giving greater weight to the language phrased merely\nas a statement of intent than to the operative language itself. Moreover,\nonly if the standard of \u201cbasic human needs\u201d encompasses less than all\nmedicines and medical supplies could the question of limitation even\narise; and, in the absence of definitions in the Act or the legislative\nhistory of \u201cmedicine or medical supplies\u201d or of \u201cbasic human needs,\u201d it\nis not evident that the second sentence is a limitation on the first. Instead, Congress could have intended to convey its belief that all\nmedicine and medical supplies would help meet a broadly conceived\nstandard of basic human need. With regard to the majority of medicine\nand medical supplies, this belief would be supportable in fact. The\npossibility that there might exist some medical goods that would not be\nthought to meet a standard of basic human need no matter how broadly\nit was defined, should not prevent Congress from legislating on the\nbasis of this presumption with regard to the entire class of goods. There is little legislative history of \u00a7 6(f)- The House version of the\nExport Administration Act originally contained an exclusion for food,\nmedicine, and medical supplies. H.R. 4034, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 6(f)\n(1979) (discussed at 125 Cong. Rec. 24,034 (1979)). The House Report\n810 accompanying the bill, however, is not helpful concerning the question\nof interpretation, for it merely restates the language of the bill itself. H.R. Rep. No. 200, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 20 (1979). The Senate version\nof the Act, S. 737, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. (1979), contained no exclusion\nat all. The conference committee agreed to the House version with an\namendment to make the exclusion apply only to medicine and medical\nsupplies. Again, however, the conference report does no more than\nstate this procedural history. H.R. Rep. No. 96-482, 96th Cong., 1st\nSess. 46 (1979). The hearings before the House subcommittee considering the bill are\nsomewhat more revealing.",

The hearings before the House subcommittee considering the bill are\nsomewhat more revealing. Again, the discussion of the exclusion was\nnot extensive; but we believe that what little discussion there was\nsupports our interpretation that the second sentence of the subsection is\nan explanation and not a limitation. As originally proposed, the exclu\u00ad\nsion in the House bill was limited to the first two sentences of what is\nnow \u00a7 6(0- It did not provide, as the third sentence of the subsection\nnow does, that the exclusion \u201cshall not be construed to prohibit the\nPresident from imposing restrictions on the export of medicine or\nmedical supplies, under the International Emergency [Economic] Powers Act,\u201d 50 U.S.C. App. 2405(0 (referring to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701\n(Supp. I 1977)). William A. Root, Director of the Office of East-West\nTrade at the Department of State, objected to the subsection as pro\u00ad\nposed because it did not explicitly recognize the President\u2019s powers\nunder the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. But there is\nno indication that Director Root understood \u00a7 6(0 as proposed to be\nother than an absolute exclusion. In fact, it was this understanding that\nled to his concern about the President\u2019s emergency powers. Specifi\u00ad\ncally, Director Root testified:\nProposed section 6(g) [now \u00a7 6(0] would exclude food,\nmedicine, and medical supplies from export controls au\u00ad\nthorized by this act for foreign policy purposes. Nor\u00ad\nmally, controls need not extend to these items. However,\nthere may arise instances where commercial exports even\nof food and medicine would not be in the national inter\u00ad\nest. There would be no objection to extending to the\nExport Administration Act the prohibition now contained\nin the [International] Emergency Economic Powers\nAct\u2014-section 203(b)(2) of Public Law 95-223\u2014against\ncontrolling donations of articles, such as food, clothing,\nand medicine, intended to be used to relieve human suffer\u00ad\ning, except to the extent that the President determines\nthat such donations are in response to coercion against the\nproposed recipient or donor. Extension and Revision of the Export Administration Act of 1969:\nHearings and Markup on H.R. 2539 Before the Subcomm. on Intema811 tional Economic Policy and Trade of the House Comm, on Foreign\nAffairs, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 648 (1979) (hereinafter cited as Hearings). Remarks made during the markup session also support the interpreta\u00ad\ntion that \u00a7 6(0 was intended to impose an absolute exclusion from\ncontrols. Representative Lagomarsino of California offered an amend\u00ad\nment to strike the \u00a7 6(0 exclusion because he was concerned with the\neffect of the subsection on existing embargoes which included food,\nmedicine, and medical supplies. But he was also concerned because he\n\u201c[did] not think that we should be saying that under no circumstances\nunder this act should we have a total solution or a total prohibition\nabout embargoes on food, medicine, and medical supplies.\u201d Hearings at\n774. Subcommittee Chairman Bingham of New York suggested that the\namendment be considered in connection with an amendment proposed\nto eliminate the next subsection of the Act which provided that a total\ntrade embargo was not authorized.",

      "content": "Hearings at\n774. Subcommittee Chairman Bingham of New York suggested that the\namendment be considered in connection with an amendment proposed\nto eliminate the next subsection of the Act which provided that a total\ntrade embargo was not authorized. Chairman Bingham explained:\nFirst of all, I think it is pretty clear this does not affect\nthe existing embargoes against Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia,\nand so on. They are authorized by other legislation. These\nparagraphs say this section does not authorize export con\u00ad\ntrols of food, medicine, and so on. Basically it is my view\nthat a total embargo is such an extreme measure that it\nought to be specifically authorized by the Congress and\nnot imposed by the administration, even though it may be\nsubject to later veto by the Congress. That applies to a\ntotal embargo, and that applies to export controls on food,\nmedicine, or medical supplies. These are extreme meas\u00ad\nures. Export controls on food and medicine are surely of\nthe gravest importance, close to an act of economic war\u00ad\nfare, and therefore it is my view that such action should\nbe imposed by the Congress by law.\n* * * * * So leaving these two paragraphs in does not change the\nlaw. It simply clarifies the law. This does not change any\nexisting controls on food and medicine or medical sup\u00ad\nplies. We simply say in effect that under this act the\nPresident cannot impose total embargo and he cannot\nimpose economic controls of that character. Id. at 774-75. Representative Bonker of Washington agreed: I would like to associate myself with the chairman\u2019s\nremarks, and retain for Congress the right to have full\nauthority over controls. . . .\n. . . [TJhere are many situations where we disagree to\u00ad\ntally with the political makeup of the government for\n812 whatever reasons, but yet this does not totally preclude\nour humanitarian commitment. I think in Southeast Asia,\nfor instance, the Red Cross is supplying medical assistance\nand certain items for relief and for humanitarian purposes. So I think that the proposed change would impose unwar\u00ad\nranted restrictions on our humanitarian commitment, even\nthough we may disagree totally with the political makeup\nof particular countries. For these reasons I would have to\noppose the amendment. Id. at 775. At this point, Director Root again explained the Administration\u2019s\nposition:\nMr. Chairman, as you know, the administration op\u00ad\nposed both subsections (0 and (g) in testimony before\nyour subcommittee earlier this month, largely for the rea\u00ad\nsons which Mr. Lagomarsino presented. With respect to\nsubsection 6(0 we did indicate, and this addresses Mr.\nBonker\u2019s point on humanitarian shipments, that we could\naccept language which was comparable to that now ap\u00ad\npearing in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which would read somewhat along the following\nlines: This section does not authorize export controls on dona\u00ad\ntions of articles such as food, clothing, and medicine,\nintended to be used to relieve human suffering, except to\nthe extent that the President determines that such dona\u00ad\ntions are in response to coercion against the proposed\nrecipient or donor. Id. at 775. Again, it is clear that \u00a7 6(0 was understood to exclude entirely medicine and medical supplies, and, at the time, food, from\ncontrols under the Export Administration Act.",

      "content": "Id. at 775. Again, it is clear that \u00a7 6(0 was understood to exclude entirely medicine and medical supplies, and, at the time, food, from\ncontrols under the Export Administration Act. The only change sought\nand obtained was express recognition that the President\u2019s emergency\npowers continued. We recognize that our interpretation that the second sentence of\n\u00a7 6(0 explains but does not limit the first is not without its own\ndifficulties. If an absolute exclusion results from the first sentence,\nCongress did not have to specify its intent in the second sentence. Moreover, if an absolute exclusion results, Congress did not have to\nspecify the situation in which controls would be precluded, that is,\nwhen the principal effect of the exports would be to help meet basic\nhuman needs. But the tension noted above between the first and second\nsentences of \u00a7 6(0 precludes an interpretation free of all difficulties; and\non balance we find that the problems with interpreting the second\nsentence as an explanation are less significant than are the problems\n813 with interpreting it as a limitation. First, as to the consequence that the\nstatement of intent in the second sentence is rendered superfluous, the\nalternative would render superfluous the first sentence or at least its\nseemingly absolute character. If we must choose between the two, we\nshould choose an interpretation that preserves that operative language\nof the statute even though it sacrifices the language of general intent. Second, as to the consequence that the second sentence would require a\ndetermination of the principal effect of the export that is irrelevant if no\ncontrols on medicine or medical supplies are authorized, we would\noffer the following saving interpretation. II. By Whom Are the Determinations of Exclusion To Be Made Initially, we should say in answer to your third question, namely,\nwho is to make the determinations of exclusion, that \u00a7 6(0 confers upon\nthe President the authority to make the determinations required under\nthe subsection; or he may delegate his power, authority, and discretion\nunder \u00a7 6(0 in accordance with the delegation provisions of \u00a7 4(e) of\nthe Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 2403(e). Because of our interpretation that\n\u00a7 6(0 imposes an absolute exclusion from controls on medicine and\nmedical supplies, it remains to be discussed just what determinations\n\u00a7 6(0 requires or allows the President or his delegate to make. III. The Meaning of the Exclusion As we have interpreted \u00a7 6(f), medicine and medical supplies are\nabsolutely excluded from controls on the ground that they are neces\u00ad\nsary to help meet basic human needs or at least that Congress thought\nso. A finding that the two standards are coterminous, however, leads to\nthe further conclusion that the discretion conferred upon the President\nunder \u00a7 6(0, although literally phrased as the determination whether\nthe principal effect of exports would be to help meet basic human\nneeds, is in fact the discretion to determine whether the exports are\nmedicines or medical supplies. This interpretation avoids so far as\npossible a construction of the second sentence of \u00a7 6(0 as conferring\ndiscretion that cannot be exercised while at the same time not validat\u00ad\ning the exercise of discretion where it was not intended.",

The interpreta\u00ad\ntion has the additional benefit of changing the definitional focus from\nthe vague concept of \u201chelp[ing to] meet basic human needs\u201d to the\nmore concrete categories of \u201cmedicine or medical supplies.\u201d This brings us to your second question. In the event that we found\nthe scope of the exclusion limited by the standard of basic human\nneeds, you asked what was meant by that phrase. In light of our\nconclusion that the exclusion is not so limited, the question is no longer\npertinent. Instead, the appropriate standard of reference is \u201cmedicine or\nmedical supplies.\u201d 814 As noted above, the Act does not define \u201cmedicine or medical\nsupplies\u201d; nor does the legislative history provide any guidance, except\nthe general humanitarian sentiments expressed.
