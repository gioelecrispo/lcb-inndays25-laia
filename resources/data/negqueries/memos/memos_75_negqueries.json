See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72701-2761. A key component of\nthe Act is its provision for the designation o f federal, state, tribal, and foreign\nnatural resource trustees (\u201c Trustees\u201d ) who have authority to recover damages for\ninjury to, destruction of, loss of, o r loss of the use of natural resources under\ntheir trusteeship, including the reasonable costs of assessing the damage.

Before reaching its current position on Trustee access to the Fund, the Coast\nGuard issued an \u201c interim rule\u201d governing the filing of claims authorized to be\npresented against the Fund under section 1013 of OPA. See Claims under the\nOil Pollution Act of 1990, 57 Fed. Reg. 36,314 (1992) (codified at 33 C.F.R.\npt. 136 (1996)). With respect to claims against the Fund for natural resource dam\u00ad\nages, the Coast Guard regulations provide in relevant part: \u201cAuthorized claimants. (a) Claims for uncompensated natural resource damages may be presented by an\nappropriate natural resources trustee.\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 136.207(a). Thus, the interim\nregulations characterize natural resource Trustees as \u201c authorized claimants\u201d for\npurposes of filing claims against the Fund pursuant to section 1013. The rule\ngoes on to provide detailed requirements for a Trustee\u2019s natural resource damages\nclaims against the Fund, including specific requirements for submitting \u201c the\nassessment and restoration plans which form the basis of the claim,\u201d id.\n\u00a7 136.209(a). Although the interim rule suggests that Trustees may pursue claims against the\nFund for natural resource damages, the preamble to the rule explains that it is\n\u201c an interim measure needed primarily to explain how eligible claimants may file\na claim against the [Fund],\u201d and that \u201c a more comprehensive rule may be devel\u00ad\noped and published for public comment.\u201d 57 Fed. Reg. at 36,314. The preamble\nto the rule further explains:\nLegal issues concerning whether, under section 1013, Federal,\nState or Indian tribe trustees can claim against the Fund for natural\nresources damages and whether Federal agencies can claim against\nthe Fund for any costs or damages have been raised. These issues\nare presently under review. This interim rule does not resolve these\nissues and leaves the matter open for future decision. Id. at 36,315. Accordingly, little guidance can be taken from the only imple\u00ad menting regulations promulgated to date. In an attempt to resolve the question left open by the interim rule, in December\nof 1993, the Coast Guard asked the Comptroller General for an opinion addressing\nwhether Trustees could present claims against the Fund under section 1012(a)(4). 191 Opinions of the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 21 In response, the Comptroller General issued an opinion concluding that \u201c natural\nresources trustees may be reimbursed from the Fund for costs incurred for damage\nassessments and the development and implementation of restoration plans only\nunder section 1012(a)(2) of the [OPA], subject to the annual appropriations pro\u00ad\ncess.

The Coast Guard\u2019s rejection of such claims is presently being contested\nin litigation brought by State Trustees who have been denied their claims against\nthe Fund. See New York v.

ANALYSIS\nA.\nThe starting point for resolving disputes concerning the interpretation of a\nstatute is, of course, the text of the statute itself. See United States v. Ron Pair\n5 A lthough the opinions and legal interpretations o f the Comptroller General often provide helpful guidance on\nappropriation matters, they are not binding upon departments or agencies of the executive branch. See Bowsher\nv Syrmr, 478 U.S. 714, 727-32 (1986)\n6 Letter for Ms Debra Preble, from Daniel F Sheehan, Director, National Pollution Funds Center, Re.

Here, the text of the statute seems\nplainly to authorize natural resource trustees to pursue claims for natural resource\ndamages and to recover directly from the Fund, without requiring a separate appro\u00ad\npriation, where they have established a valid claim under section 1013 of the\nAct. Section 1012(a)(4) of the Act authorizes \u201c the payment of claims in accord\u00ad\nance with section [1013 of the Act] for uncompensated . . . damages,\u201d 33 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2712(a)(4), and section 6002 of the Act provides that a separate appropriation\nis not required for payments made pursuant to section 1012(a)(4), see 33 U.S.C.\n\u00a72752. A \u201c claim \u201d is defined to include a written request for payment \u201c for com\u00ad\npensation for damages,\u201d id. \u00a72701(3), and, in turn, a \u201c \u2018claimant\u2019 means any\nperson or government who presents a claim for compensation\u201d under the Act,\nid. \u00a72701(4) (emphasis added). 7",

Congress expressly authorized a claimant under section 1013 to present a claim\nto the Fund in three separate provisions: once in section 1013(c), once in section\n1013(d), and once again in section 1012(a)(4). None of those provisions indicate,\nor in any way suggest, that Trustees are excluded from the category of claimants\nto which they apply. Nor is there any ambiguity as to which provision of section\n1012 governs the payment of such claims. Section 1012(a)(4) expressly governs\n\u201c the payment of claims in accordance with section [1 0 1 3 ]\u201d (emphasis added),\nwhereas section 1012(a)(2) makes no reference to the section 1013 claims proce\u00ad\ndure. The various provisions authorizing payments from the Fund under section 1012,\nmoreover, were drawn with considerable precision. For example, Congress speci\u00ad\nfied that only costs incurred by \u201c Federal, State, or Indian tribe trustees\u201d \u2014 but\nnot foreign trustees \u2014 could be paid pursuant to section 1012(a)(2). Had the\ncongressional drafters similarly intended to exclude Trustees from the class of\nclaimants eligible to receive payments on their claims under section 1012(a)(4) \u2014\na class that would naturally encompass Trustees under the straightforward defini\u00ad\ntions of the statute \u2014 it seems unlikely that they would have left such a significant\nexclusion to be inferred. Rather, the exclusion of Trustees\u2019 claims could have\nbeen readily and unambiguously achieved by inserting a single phrase in sub\u00ad\nsection (a)(4) \u2014 by selectively authorizing, for example, \u201c (4) the payment of\nclaims, other than payments otherwise authorized under subparagraph (a)(2) of\nthis section , in accordance with section 2713 of this title.\u201d Congress refrained,\nhowever, from drawing any such distinction. 7 It does not appear to be in dispute that OPA\u2019s definition o f \u201c claimant\u201d includes Trustees who present a claim\nfor natural resource damages compensation under section 1013 o f the Act 193 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 21 The text of OPA, accordingly, seems clearly to provide that the Fund may be\nused to pay the claims of Trustees, pursuant to the provisions of sections\n1012(a)(4) and 1013, without the requirement for annual appropriations. B.\nDOT interprets the relevant provisions of OPA in a different manner. DOT\nasserts that, because section 1012(a)(2) of OPA separately authorizes Fund pay\u00ad\nments to Trustees for \u201c costs incurred,\u201d and because such costs overlap to a large\nextent with the removal costs and uncompensated damages that may form the\nbasis of a claim under section 1012(a)(4), there is a conflict or inconsistency\nbetween the two provisions if the latter also applies to Trustees.",

Invoking the analysis used by the Comptroller General in his 1995\nruling in this dispute, DOT likens the payment authorization of section 1012(a)(4)\nto a general appropriation which cannot be used to fund payments covered by\na more specific appropriation, in the form of section 1012(a)(2)\u2019s provision for\npayment of costs incurred by Trustees. Coast Guard Ltr. at 2. Specifically, DOT\nrelies upon the following principle o f statutory construction applied by the Comp\u00ad\ntroller General in his opinion on access to the Fund: Where there is a seeming conflict between a general provision and\na specific provision and the general provision is broad enough to\ninclude the subject to which the specific provision relates, the spe\u00ad\ncific provision should be regarded as an exception to the general\nprovision so that both may be given effect, the general applying\nonly where the specific provision is inapplicable. 194 Funds Available fo r Payment o f Natural Resource Damages Under the Oil Pollution Act o f J990 CG Op. at 4 (quoting B-163375, 1971 WL 5205 (C.G.

Initially, we note that the specific/general principle relied upon by DOT is but\na canon of statutory construction, which, like other such rules, must yield to supe\u00ad\nrior evidence of legislative intent. See Connecticut N a t\u2019I Bank v. Germain, 503\nU.S. 249, 253 (1992); Rubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, 430 (1981). Here,\nnot only the plain meaning of the statute, but other indicia of statutory intent\ncounsel against the construction proposed by DOT. The principal basis preferred\nby DOT for precluding federal, state, and Indian tribe trustees from recovering\npursuant to section 1012(a)(4), for example, is that they are expressly entitled\nto recover costs incurred pursuant to section 1012(a)(2). That section, however,\nby its own terms does not apply to foreign trustees, and thus, under DOT\u2019s rea\u00ad\nsoning, foreign trustees may still recover under section 1012(a)(4), without the\ndiscipline of a further appropriation. It seems highly improbable, however, that\nCongress intended to provide foreign trustees more liberal access to the Fund than\nit provided to domestic trustees.",

The most fundamental difficulty with DOT\u2019s argument, however, concerns its\ncritical premise: we do not find an irreconcilable conflict or inconsistency, see\nCG Op. at 4, between the payment provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (a)(4),\neven taking into account their relationship with the appropriations provisions of\nsection 6002 o f the Act. Absent such a conflict or inconsistency, or other compel\u00ad\nling indicia of contrary congressional intent, there is no need or justification to\ndepart from a straightforward application o f the statutory text.

Those\nregulatory requirements include, inter alia, the preparation and presentation of the\noften costly assessment and restoration plans which form the basis of the claim;\na description o f damages claimed by category; documented costs and cost esti\u00ad\nmates for the plan; evidence relating to the spill and the damages; witness lists\nand descriptions of their knowledge of the incident; certification of the accuracy\nof claims submitted to the Fund; and certification as to whether the assessment\nwas conducted in accordance with applicable provisions of the natural resources\ndamage assessment regulations.

CG Op. at 4\u20145. By this reasoning, Trustees would invariably\nbypass the subsection (a)(2) mechanism in favor of the claims provision of sub\u00ad\nsection (a)(4) because the latter allows the direct payment of damages without\nthe need for further congressional appropriation. This argument is premised on\nthe interpretive canon providing that a statute should not be interpreted in a way\nthat renders portions of it meaningless or ineffective. See Department o f Revenue\nv. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U.S. 332, 340-41 (1994). DOT and the Comptroller General, however, have failed to demonstrate that\nsubsection (a)(2) would be rendered meaningless if Trustees were permitted access\nto the Fund under subsection (a)(4). Before pursuing a claim under section 1013,\nfor example, a claimant must generally present the claim to the responsible party\nand wait the required 90 days. When submitted, moreover, the claim must be\nsupported by extensive assessment and documentation of the nature and extent\nof costs and damages, accompanied by certification of the accuracy and integrity\nof the claim as presented. See 33 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 136.105 to 136.113, 136.209. Payment\no f the claim must then await NPFC review, evaluation, and adjudication. Congress might well have contemplated occasions when Trustees would be\nbetter served by seeking payments under subsection (a)(2), rather than comply\nwith these substantial requirements applicable to claims under subsection (a)(4),\neven though payment under subsection (a)(2) would require a congressional appro\u00ad\npriation. For example, a Trustee with limited resources might find it preferable\nto obtain payment for at least a portion of its allowable costs under subsection\n(a)(2) rather than complying with the procedural requirements for the presentation\nand adjudication of a claim against the Fund under section 1012(a)(4). Addition\u00ad\nally, if a Trustee\u2019s claim is denied by the NPFC under subsection (a)(4) \u2014 due\nto noncompliance with the 33 C.F.R. pt. 136 procedural requirements, for\nexample, see 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 136.105(a) \u2014 it could have a basis for pursuing those\nportions of its claim that constitute costs incurred under the provisions of sub\u00ad\nsection (a)(2). Indeed, if Congress were to make available a significant portion\nof the Fund for payments under subsection (a)(2) in an annual appropriations act,\nsee 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2752(a), it seems unlikely that eligible Trustees would bother\nto pursue payment under sections 1012(a)(4) and 1013 for costs otherwise recover\u00ad\nable under subsection (a)(2) pursuant to the appropriation.

Memorandum for the Commander, National\nPollution Funds Center, from Chief, General Law Division, U.S. Coast Guard at\n4 (Oct. 27, 1992); see also CG Op. at 4. The pertinent legislative history, however,\nfails to provide persuasive support for DOT\u2019s position. The limited evidence of\ncongressional intent that is available suggests that Congress intended to permit\nTrustees to obtain compensation directly from the Fund for natural resource dam\u00ad\nages under section 1013 of the Act. Moreover, given the great significance of\na conclusion that Trustees may not obtain such compensation, the very paucity\nof evidence supporting the DOT construction of the statute, standing alone, casts\ndoubt on that construction. Because the provision excluding the payment of claims pursuant to section\n1012(a)(4) from the annual appropriations requirement was first introduced as part\nof the Conference substitute version of the bill, our review of the legislative his\u00ad\ntory must focus on the Conference Report and subsequent debate. 13 In describing\nsection 1012(a)(4), the OPA Conference Report stated that \u201c amounts are available\nunder category (4), without further appropriation, to p a y uncompensated claims\nin accordance with section 1013.\" H.R.

In differentiating the uses o f the Fund authorized under subsections (a)(1)\nthrough (3) of section 1012, which were made subject to appropriations, the Con\u00ad\nference Report stressed that \u201c [t]hese amounts may be obligated by the Federal\nofficial or officials designated under the regulations authorized in subsection (c),\nand are not necessarily subject to the claims procedures in section 1013.\u201d Id. at 113, reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 792.

Thus, the Con\u00ad\nferees recognized the distinguishing characteristic warranting payment of claims\nunder section 1012(a)(4) without a requirement for further appropriation \u2014 i.e.,\nsuch payments were predicated on prior compliance with the section 1013 claims\nprocedure. The Conference Report also contained a separate explanation of the section 1013\nclaims procedure and how it was adopted by the Conference. Id. at 117, reprinted\nin 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 795.

Given the fact that Trustees are the only claimants able to\nassert natural resource damages claims under section 1013, and given that prompt\ncompensation for natural resource damages was a paramount concern of the legis\u00ad\nlation, it would be surprising for the Conferees to use such unqualified language\nif they intended to bar Trustees from obtaining compensation from the Fund on\ntheir claims unless an annual appropriation was enacted.

Once this legislation is signed into law,\nthose adversely affected will not have to wait years in order to\nrecover their losses.

United States, 461 U.S. 574, 599-600 (1983) (although \u201c [n]onaction by Congress is not often a useful guide,\u201d inaction fol\u00ad\nlowing prolonged and extensive congressional consideration of legislative pro\u00ad\nposals to overturn an administrative interpretation may produce \u201c unusually\nstrong\u201d evidence of legislative acquiescence). The cases ascribing significance to legislative inaction are generally premised\nupon informed congressional acquiescence in a longstanding interpretation by the\nexecutive branch agency charged with administering the statute in question. In\nBob Jones University, for example, the Court invoked the principle only after\nstressing that \u201c for a dozen years Congress has been made aware \u2014 acutely\naware \u2014 o f the IRS rulings o f 1970 and 1971.\u201d 461 U.S. at 599. Here, the ruling\nin which Congress allegedly acquiesced was considered only by a committee of\nCongress in early 1996, only a few months after it had been issued in October,\n1995, by the Comptroller General. Thus, the circumstances posed here simply\ndo not fit the pattern of the leading cases finding persuasive evidence of acquies\u00ad\ncence by inaction.",

In the cited cases, the issue\ninvolved \u201c considerable public controversy,\u201d or Congress had a \u201c prolonged and acute awareness\u201d o f the\nimportance of the issue.

It would thus have removed the crucial premise to\nthe Comptroller General\u2019s decision and would have eliminated any doubt that\nTrustees could recover natural resource damages from the Fund without further\nappropriation. However, that amendment was modified by the Senate Committee\non Environment and Public Works, which approved and reported S. 1730 with\nan amendment to section 6002 that did not include the appropriations exemption\nfor section 1012(a)(2) and thus did not nullify the Comptroller General\u2019s opinion. See S. Rep. No. 104-292, at 31-32 (1996). In any event, however, S. 1730 was\nnever taken up by the full Senate or the House. Consequently, congressional\nconsideration of the proposal to override the Comptroller General\u2019s interpretation\nwas apparently limited to action on a single amendment by a single committee\nof the Senate. 16 In Bob Jones University, the Court departed from the general ru le 17 that\ncongressional inaction \u201c is not often a useful guide\u201d only after stressing that \u201c few\nissues have been the subject of more vigorous and widespread debate and discus\u00ad\nsion in and out of Congress\u201d than the educational segregation issue implicated\nby the IRS ruling under consideration there. 461 U.S. at 599. In light of the\nlengthy and widespread congressional exposure to legislation concerning that\nruling, the Court observed: It is hardly conceivable that Congress \u2014 and in this setting, any\nMember of Congress \u2014 was not abundantly aware of what was\ngoing on. In view of its prolonged and acute awareness of so impor\u00ad\ntant an issue, Congress\u2019 failure to act on the bill proposed on this\nsubject provides added support for concluding that Congress\nacquiesced in the IRS rulings in 1970 and 1971.

Here, the record does not demonstrate anything like the prolonged, acute, and\nwidespread congressional consideration of the Comptroller General\u2019s 1995 opinion\nthat provides the necessary justification for ascribing significance to congressional\naction under the holding of Bob Jones University.

Under such circumstances, the fact that Congress did not enact legislation\noverturning the Comptroller General\u2019s interpretation does not provide persuasive\nevidence of congressional ratification. Considering the legislative record as a whole, therefore, we are unable to con\u00ad\nclude that Congress\u2019s response to proposed amendments to section 6002 of OPA\noffered in the 104th Congress provides significant legislative evidence supporting\nthe Comptroller General\u2019s opinion concerning Trustee access to the Fund. Conclusion In light of all the foregoing considerations, we conclude that section 1012(a)(4)\nof OPA authorizes payments from the Fund to natural resource trustees on claims\nfor uncompensated natural resource damages pursued in accordance with section\n1013. Under section 6002(b) of OPA, such payments may be made from the Fund\nwithout the need for further enactment of appropriations. RANDOLPH D.
