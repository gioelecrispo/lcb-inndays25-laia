March 30, 2007 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(c) (2000), a former senior official of the Executive\nBranch, in the year after his departure, may not communicate with, or appear\nbefore, his former agency \u201con behalf of any other person (except the United\nStates),\u201d in connection with a matter on which he seeks official action.

A.\nWe have previously concluded that communications \u201con behalf of\u201d a person\nunder section 207 \u201cinclude only communications that are made by one who is\nacting as an agent or attorney, or in some other representational capacity for\nanother.\u201d Memorandum for Michael Boudin, Deputy Assistant Attorney General,\nAntitrust Division, from J.

A\nformer senior official who works at the Board and communicates in his official\ncapacity to the Commission would do so as the Board\u2019s agent: \u201c\u2018Agency is the\nfiduciary relation which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to\nanother that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and the\nconsent of the other so to act.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Restatement of the Law (Second) of\nAgency \u00a7 1 (1958) (emphasis omitted)); accord Restatement of the Law (Third) of\nAgency \u00a7 1.01 (2006). The applicability of section 207(c) thus turns on whether,\nas an agent of the Board, a former employee of the Commission would act as an\nagent of \u201cthe United States.\u201d The statute answers that question in the negative. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides that \u201c[n]o member or person employed by, or\nagent for, the Board shall be deemed to be an officer or employee of or agent for\nthe Federal Government by reason of such service.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7211(b) (emphasis added). That provision, we believe, indicates that a person employed by or\nacting as agent for the Board is not acting \u201con behalf of . . . the United States\u201d\nunder section 207(c). Title 18 does not have a general definition of \u201cthe United\nStates,\u201d except \u201cin a territorial sense,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5 (2000), but section 207(c)\nitself suggests the meaning in the present context.

When the\nsection later refers to a communication \u201con behalf of . . . the United States,\u201d the\n\u201cnormal rule of statutory construction\u201d would call for the conclusion that \u201cidentical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same\nmeaning,\u201d Sorenson v.

O.L.C. 84 (1988) (\u201cUnion Station\u201d). There, we stated that we have\n\u201clooked to the definition of \u2018agency of the United States\u2019 in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6 to\ndetermine if an entity should be regarded as the United States for the purposes of\nthe conflict of interest laws.\u201d Id. at 84. We have some doubt that this characterization is entirely correct; the opinions cited in Union Station may be read to interpret\nthe term \u201cagency\u201d or \u201cagency of the United States,\u201d not \u201cUnited States\u201d itself. Nevertheless, even if that line of opinions is applicable, it is consistent with the\nconclusion we reach here. Section 6 states that\n[t]he term \u2018agency\u2019 includes any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the\nUnited States or any corporation in which the United States has a\nproprietary interest, unless the context shows that such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6. We have read section 6 as \u201cestablish[ing] a presumption that a\ngovernmental entity is an agency for purposes of a given offense, including the\nconflict of interest statutes.\u201d Application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 205 to Union Organizing\nActivities of Department of Justice Employee, 5 Op.

Similarly, Congress\u2019s declaration that\nthe Board is not \u201can agency or establishment of the United States Government\u201d is\ndispositive of its status as an agency under the conflict of interest laws. When a statute has not expressly addressed whether an entity is an agency or\nestablishment of the United States, we sometimes have examined such factors as\nthe entity\u2019s \u201cfunctions, financing, control, and management.\u201d Union Station, 12\nOp. O.L.C. at 86. 4 But the use of a multi-factor test is not appropriate where, as\n4\nA 1948 letter of the Attorney General concluded that the Panama Railroad Company was an\nagency of the United States for purposes of the conflict of interest laws, Letter for the Secretary of the\nArmy, from Tom C.

No. 80-807, 62 Stat. 51 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 31 here, Congress has explicitly determined that an entity is not an agency of the\nUnited States for purposes within Congress\u2019s control. The conclusion that the Board is not \u201cthe United States,\u201d we believe, squares\nwith the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2019s own post-employment provision. Under 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7211(g)(3), the Board is to\nestablish ethics rules and standards of conduct for Board members\nand staff, including a bar on practice before the Board (and the\nCommission, with respect to Board-related matters) of 1 year for\nformer members of the Board, and appropriate periods (not to exceed\n1 year) for former staff of the Board. This provision does put the Board into a position similar to that of an agency of\nthe federal government, but this treatment is entirely consistent with the view that\nthe Board is not a federal agency for purposes of the general conflict of interest\nlaws, including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(c), and thus requires its own conflict of interest\nprovision. And although the provision, by limiting the practice before the Commission by former Board members and staff, might be read to suggest that, for\nconflict of interest purposes, the Board should be equated with the Commission,\nthe bar on practice before the Commission also could reflect a concern that\nconfidential information involving regulated entities might give former Board\nmembers and staff an unfair advantage. Cf. Bayless Manning, Federal Conflict of 1075, 1076 (1948). In 1963, we found that the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d)\nwas an agency of the United States under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 431 (1958). See Memorandum for Joseph F.\nDolan, Assistant Deputy Attorney General, from Norbert A. Schlei, Assistant Attorney General, Office\nof Legal Counsel (Dec. 18, 1963) (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d). In that instance, the statute made Fannie Mae \u201ca\nconstituent agency of the Housing and Home Finance Agency,\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1717 (1958), and Fannie\nMae\u2019s obligations were not obligations of the United States or \u201cof any agency or instrumentality\nthereof other than [Fannie Mae],\u201d id. \u00a7\u00a7 1719(b), 1721(b) (emphasis added); the \u201cother than\u201d language\nsuggested that Fannie Mae itself was an agency or instrumentality of the government.",

Given the \u201cunique statutory relationship between the\n[Board] and the Commission,\u201d there may be a strong policy argument that, for\npurposes of the conflict of interest laws, the Board should be treated as an agency\nof the government. On the other hand, the Board in several respects is similar to\nself-regulatory organizations like the National Association of Securities Dealers\n(\u201cNASD\u201d), \u201ca private body empowered by the Commission to oversee the\nactivities of broker-dealers.\u201d United States v. Frith, 461 F.3d 914, 916 (7th Cir.\n2006). Although the Commission\u2019s authority to oversee the Board is even greater\nthan its authority to oversee the NASD, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act declares that\nseveral provisions of the securities laws relating to the Commission\u2019s oversight\npowers \u201cshall apply to the Board as fully as if the Board were a \u2018registered\nsecurities association.\u2019\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7217(a), (b)(4), (b)(5), (c)(2). The statute, to\nthis extent, treats the Board like the private NASD, which we understand is the\nonly \u201cregistered securities association.\u201d Congress may have wished to treat the\nBoard as private for all statutory purposes, and section 7211(b) indicates that this\nis what Congress chose to do.",
