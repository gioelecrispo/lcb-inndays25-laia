January 20, 2017 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT You have asked whether section 3110 of title 5, U.S. Code, which forbids a public official from appointing a relative \u201cto a civilian position in\nthe agency . . . over which [the official] exercises jurisdiction or control,\u201d\nbars the President from appointing his son-in-law to a position in the\nWhite House Office, where the President\u2019s immediate personal staff of\nadvisors serve. We conclude that section 3110 does not bar this appointment because the President\u2019s special hiring authority in 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a)\nexempts positions in the White House Office from section 3110. A decision of the D.C. Circuit, Haddon v. Walters, 43 F.3d 1488 (D.C.\nCir. 1995) (per curiam), lays out a different, but overlapping, route to the\nsame result. According to the reasoning of Haddon, section 3110 does not\nreach an appointment in the White House Office because section 3110\ncovers only appointments in an \u201cagency,\u201d which the statute defines to\ninclude \u201cExecutive agenc[ies],\u201d and the White House Office is not an\n\u201cExecutive agency\u201d within the definition generally applicable to title 5. Although our analysis does not track every element of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s\nreasoning about the meaning of \u201cExecutive agency,\u201d we believe that\nHaddon arrived at the correct outcome and that our conclusion here\u2014that,\nbecause of the President\u2019s special hiring authority for the White House\nOffice, section 3110 does not forbid the proposed appointment\u2014squares\nwith both the holding and a central part of the analysis in that case. I.\nSection 105(a) of title 3 authorizes the President \u201cto appoint and fix the\npay of employees in the White House Office without regard to any other\nprovision of law regulating the employment or compensation of persons\nin the Government service,\u201d as long as the employees\u2019 pay is within listed\n1 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 41 salary caps. 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a)(1). These employees are to \u201cperform such\nofficial duties as the President may prescribe.\u201d Id. \u00a7 105(b)(1). We understand that most White House Office employees are appointed under section 105 or a similar hiring authority, such as 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 107 (the authorization for domestic policy staff ).

The appointment at issue here, we understand, would be under 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a). Section 3110 of title 5, also known as the anti-nepotism statute, states\nthat \u201c[a] public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or\nadvocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or\nto a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he\nexercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the\npublic official.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3110(b).

Section 3110 prohibits the appointment of certain persons to positions\nof employment in the federal government.

During the House subcommittee hearing, the General Counsel to the\nPresident\u2019s Reorganization Project at the Office of Management and\nBudget (\u201cOMB\u201d) testified that the language exempting the White House\nOffice (along with other entities in the Executive Office of the President)\nfrom the usual rules on hiring and compensation \u201cwould not exempt\n[these entities] from the restrictions under the nepotism statute because of\nthe specific provisions of that act which apply to the President.\u201d Authorization for the White House Staff: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on\nEmployee Ethics and Utilization of the H.

Although no member of\nthe subcommittee disputed the OMB official\u2019s interpretation, it is far from\nclear whether the members (and later, the authors of the House and Senate\nreports) ultimately endorsed his view about the language. The OMB\nofficial offered his interpretation after the subcommittee chair asked about\nthe language\u2019s effect on a number of federal laws and authorities, including \u201cthe Hatch Act, nepotism law, criminal conflict of interest laws, [and]\nExecutive Order 11222 regulating employee conduct\u201d; the chair explained that she was asking in order to draft the committee report.

Because the President exercises \u201cjurisdiction or control\u201d over the entire\nExecutive Branch, section 3110, by its express terms, would seemingly\napply to the President\u2019s filling of numerous positions in federal agencies,\neven if the \u201cwithout regard to any other provision of law\u201d language carved\nout a handful of entities in the Executive Office of the President, such as the\nWhite House Office.

In our view, therefore, section 105(a) exempts presidential appointments to the White House Office from the scope of the anti-nepotism\nstatute. 5 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 41 II.\nHaddon v. Walters, 43 F.3d 1488 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (per curiam), also\nbears on the question here and might appear to resolve it, albeit through a\ndifferent route. Relying on arguments that would apply equally to the\nWhite House Office, Haddon held that the Executive Residence at the\nWhite House is not an \u201cExecutive agency\u201d within the title 5 definition. Id.\nat 1490. Because the prohibition in section 3110 applies, as relevant here,\nonly to appointments in \u201cExecutive agenc[ies],\u201d Haddon seems to compel\nthe conclusion that the bar against nepotism would not extend to appointments in the White House Office. Reinforcing this conclusion, though\nresting on other grounds, an earlier opinion of the D.C. Circuit had expressed \u201cdoubt that Congress intended to include the White House\u201d as an\n\u201cagency\u201d under section 3110. AAPS, 997 F.2d at 905; but see id. at 920\u2013\n21 (Buckley, J., concurring in the judgment) (disputing that interpretation\nof \u201cagency\u201d). The matter, however, is somewhat more complicated. Not every part of\nthe reasoning in Haddon is entirely persuasive, and the court\u2019s rationale\nextends more broadly than necessary, in our view, to address the question\nnow at hand. Nonetheless, we believe that Haddon lends support to our\nconclusion that the President may appoint relatives to positions in the\nWhite House Office. Haddon held that the Executive Residence, which like the White House\nOffice has a staff appointed under title 3, see 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(b), is not an\n\u201cExecutive agency\u201d within the title 5 definition.

The D.C. Circuit had two reasons for concluding that the Executive\nResidence is not an independent establishment and therefore not an Executive agency under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 105. First, the court observed that another\n6 Application of Anti-Nepotism Statute to Presidential Appointment in White House statute, 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, authorizes \u201c[t]he head of any department, agency,\nor independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government\n[to] detail, from time to time, employees of such department, agency, or\nestablishment to the White House Office, the Executive Residence at the\nWhite House, the Office of the Vice President, the Domestic Policy Staff,\nand the Office of Administration.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, this phrasing\nsuggested that the listed entities in the Executive Office of the President\nare not themselves \u201cdepartment[s], agenc[ies], or independent establishment[s].\u201d Haddon, 43 F.3d at 1490 (\u201cThat Congress distinguished the\nExecutive Residence from the independent establishments, whatever they\nmay be, suggests that Congress does not regard the Executive Residence\nto be an independent establishment, as it uses that term.\u201d). Second, the\ncourt said that title 5 of the U.S. Code \u201crelates to government organization\nand employees and prescribes pay and working conditions for agency\nemployees,\u201d while title 3 of the Code \u201caddresses similar concerns with\nrespect to the President\u2019s advisors and the staff of the Executive Residence.\u201d Id. The incorporation of the title 5 definition in section 2000e\u201316,\nthe court explained, suggests that Congress intended the statute to cover\nonly \u201ctitle 5\u201d positions\u2014not positions provided for in 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105 and\nother title 3 authorities. Id. 2\nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s first reason may be the less convincing of the two. The wording of the detail statute, 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u201cdistinguish[es]\u201d between the sending and receiving entities only insofar as the sending entities are identified generically, while the small group of entities that may\nreceive details, including the Executive Residence and the White House\nOffice, are specifically named. This wording might well be an apt way to\nauthorize a detail without implying anything about the status of the receiving entities. Indeed, Congress elsewhere used similar constructions\nto provide for transfers between executive departments. Section 2256 of\ntitle 7, U.S. Code, declares that the \u201chead of any department\u201d may \u201ctransfer to the Department [of Agriculture]\u201d funds to perform certain inspections, analyses, or tests.

See id. \u00a7 2(a) (relevant provisions codified at 3 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401, 402, 411). 7 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 41 the Department of State.\u201d The generic references to \u201cdepartments\u201d on one\nside of these transactions could not be read to imply that the entities on\nthe other side, the Departments of Agriculture and State, are not \u201cdepartments.\u201d The court\u2019s second argument seems stronger, although the court stated\nit more broadly than the facts of Haddon required. The court apparently\nviewed the provisions in title 3 as creating a complete substitute for title 5:\n\u201cwhile Title 5 relates to government organization and employees and\nprescribes pay and working conditions for agency employees, Title 3\naddresses similar concerns with respect to the President\u2019s advisors and the\nstaff of the Executive Residence.\u201d Haddon, 43 F.3d at 1490 (citation\nomitted). The court then quoted, in a parenthetical, the \u201cwithout regard\u201d\nprovision for hiring in the Executive Residence that exactly parallels\nthe one for the White House Office. Id. (quoting 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(b)(1)). Inasmuch as the plaintiff in Haddon claimed that he had been unlawfully\npassed over for promotion\u2014that he had not been appointed to a higher\nposition with higher pay\u2014his claim had to do with exactly the subjects\nidentified in 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(b)(1), \u201cemployment or compensation of\npersons in the Government service.\u201d Section 105(b)(1) could therefore be\nunderstood to displace the restrictions in Title VII, even if title 3 did not\ncompletely displace all of title 5. Thus, the court\u2019s broader statements\nabout the relationship of title 3 and title 5, though not dicta, went further\nthan necessary to decide the case and further than we need to go here. In any event, our conclusion above\u2014that the President\u2019s special hiring\nauthority in 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a) allows him to appoint relatives to the White\nHouse Office without regard to section 3110\u2019s bar against nepotism\u2014is\nconsistent with the holding in Haddon and with the court\u2019s reliance on the\nparallel language in 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(b)(1). In accordance with Haddon,\nwe believe that the White House Office is not an \u201cExecutive agency\u201d\ninsofar as the laws on employment and compensation are concerned. Both\nthe \u201cwithout regard\u201d language of section 105(a) and the general treatment\nof the White House Office under title 3 instead of title 5 undergird this\nconclusion. 3 Having conformed our analysis, to this extent, with the only\nauthoritative judicial guidance bearing on this question, we have no need\nto delve into the issue whether the White House Office should be consid- 3 We do not address the application of section 3110 to any other component of the\ngovernment. 8 Application of Anti-Nepotism Statute to Presidential Appointment in White House ered outside of title 5 for all purposes whenever the application of that\ntitle is confined to \u201cExecutive agenc[ies].\u201d 4\n4",

See Section 603 Opinion, 27\nOp. O.L.C. at 119 (White House Office employees may make contributions to a President\u2019s authorized re-election campaign by virtue of an exception available to employees\nin an \u201cExecutive agency\u201d).

Section 7322(1), in turn, defines\n\u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany individual, other than the President and the Vice President, employed\nor holding office in . . . an Executive agency.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7322(1)(A). Several considerations led us in our Section 603 Opinion to confirm a prior opinion treating the White\nHouse Office as an \u201cExecutive agency\u201d for purposes of section 7322(1), see Whether 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 603 Bars Civilian Executive Branch Employees and Officers from Making\nContributions to a President\u2019s Authorized Re-Election Campaign Committee, 19 Op.\nO.L.C. 103 (1995).

Our Office, on several occasions, has addressed the application of section 3110 to presidential appointments, including appointments to the\nWhite House Office and other entities within the Executive Office of the\nPresident. Although our conclusion today departs from some of that prior\nwork, we think that this departure is fully justified. Our initial opinions on\nthe subject drew unwarranted inferences about Congress\u2019s intent from a\nsingle witness statement in a congressional hearing. Moreover, the surrounding legal context has been transformed by the subsequent enactment\nof section 105(a), which expressly and specifically addresses employment\nwithin the White House Office, and also by the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in\nHaddon. A.\nSection 3110 was enacted in 1967.

While acknowledging that the appropriation language was \u201cbroad\u201d and\nthe issue \u201cnot wholly free of doubt,\u201d our memorandum regarding the\nWhite House appointment reasoned that section 3110 should be understood as a \u201cspecific prohibition\u201d constituting an \u201cexception to the general\nrule that limitations on employment do not apply to the White House\nOffice.\u201d White House Aide Memo II, at 3.

(quoting Radzanower\nv. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 153 (1976)). But the canon about\ngeneral and specific statutes seems of limited help here, because neither\nof the two relevant statutes can readily be characterized as more or less\nspecific than the other. To be sure, section 3110 could be said to concern\nthe \u201cspecific\u201d subject of nepotism. But section 105(a) could reasonably be\ndescribed as a statute \u201cdealing with [the] narrow, precise, and specific\u201d\nsubject of hiring for the White House Office that ought to overcome the\ngenerally applicable anti-nepotism rule of section 3110. The 1977 memoranda also put significant weight on the legislative history of section 3110, discerning a clear congressional intent that the\nExecutive Office of the President, including the White House Office, be\namong the entities subject to the anti-nepotism prohibition. See Mental\nHealth Commission Memo I; Mental Health Commission Memo II, at 5;\nWhite House Aide Memo I, at 2; White House Aide Memo II, at 2\u20133. We\nthink that this history is not so compelling, however, as to direct the\noutcome on the question here. Section 3110 was enacted as part of the Postal Revenue and Federal\nSalary Act of 1967. See Pub. L. No. 90-206, \u00a7 221, 81 Stat. 613, 640. When Congress considered and passed the legislation, the annual appropriations for the Executive Office of the President then in effect included\nthe permissive language about the President\u2019s authority to hire personnel\nin the White House Office. See Pub. L. No. 90-47, tit. III, 81 Stat. 113,\n117 (1967). As our 1977 memoranda observed, there was no mention of\nthose appropriations or that language during Congress\u2019s consideration of\n13 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 41 the anti-nepotism provision. But one witness, the Chairman of the Civil\nService Commission, testified before the Senate committee that, in his\nview, the language then under consideration would have prevented President Franklin Delano Roosevelt from appointing his son \u201cat the White\nHouse as a civilian aide\u201d (as President Roosevelt had done). Federal Pay\nLegislation: Hearings Before the S. Comm. on Post Office and Civil\nService, 90th Cong. 366 (1967) (\u201cFederal Pay Legislation Hearings\u201d)\n(testimony of Chairman Macy). Following the hearing, the Senate amended the provision in the bill and explicitly named the President as a \u201cpublic\nofficial\u201d to whom the bar applied. \u201cBecause the Senate Hearings contain\nthe only extended discussion of the provision and the only discussion at\nall of its application to the President,\u201d we explained in our memorandum\nconcerning the White House appointment, \u201cit seems appropriate to attach\nparticular significance to the Civil Service Commission\u2019s interpretation of\nthe statute in the course of the hearings.

It is\nunclear why the Senate amended the provision to apply instead to \u201cExecutive agenc[ies]\u201d and thus to call up the title 5 definition of that term. See\nH.R. 7977, 90th Cong. \u00a7 221 (as reported out of S. Comm. on Post Office\nand Civil Service, Nov. 21, 1967). The Senate report does not explain the\nchange. See S. Rep. No. 90-801, at 28 (1967). Nevertheless, that the Civil\nService Commission Chairman was considering different statutory language when offering his view about the scope of the prohibition dilutes\nthe strength of his testimony\u2014which, as a witness statement, should\ntypically be afforded less weight to begin with. See S&E Contractors, 406\nU.S. at 13 n.9; Gustafson, 513 U.S. at 580. Because the appropriation language was apparently never mentioned\nduring the House\u2019s or Senate\u2019s consideration of the bill, the debates and\n14 Application of Anti-Nepotism Statute to Presidential Appointment in White House other materials include no clear statement that the anti-nepotism provision\nwas intended to prevail over the broad hiring authority previously granted\nin that year\u2019s appropriation for the Executive Office of the President. 6 Moreover, aside from that single question about the service of President\nRoosevelt\u2019s son as a White House aide\u2014which was part of a series of\nquestions posed by the senators to Chairman Macy about the language\u2019s\napplication to the President generally, see Federal Pay Legislation Hearings at 360\u201369\u2014neither the Senate nor the House appears to have focused\non the White House Office. We therefore are hesitant to infer that the 90th\nCongress envisioned that section 3110 would overcome the President\u2019s\nhiring authorities under the annual appropriation. We are even more\nreluctant to draw that inference with respect to the permanent special\nhiring authority for the White House Office that Congress enacted ten\nyears later. IV. Finally, we believe that this result\u2014that the President may appoint relatives to his immediate staff of advisors in the White House Office\u2014makes\nsense when considered in light of other applicable legal principles.

      "content": "Individual senators did stress the amended provision\u2019s breadth in floor statements. See 113 Cong. Rec. 36103 (1967) (statement of Sen. Randolph) (indicating that the Senate\namended the provision \u201cto plug any loopholes which might exist,\u201d because \u201c[i]t was\ncritical that the nepotism provisions be applied across the board\u201d); id. (stating that \u201c[w]e\ncould not stop at a certain point in formulating a policy on nepotism\u201d and \u201chad to apply\nthe policy across the board\u201d); id. at 36103\u201304 (suggesting that \u201cthe White House believes,\nas does now the Congress, that a nonnepotism policy should apply equally to any branch\nof Government\u201d); id. at 37316 (statement of Sen. Udall) (explaining that the provision\napplies \u201cacross-the-board, from the highest office to the lowest paid job, with equal force\nand effect\u201d and that \u201c[n]o official in any of the three branches of the Government . . . may\nappoint or promote a relative to any position under his or her control or jurisdiction,\u201d and\ncalling it \u201cthe strongest possible guarantee against any abuse of Federal appointive\nauthority and any preference in Federal positions that is adverse to the public interest\u201d). These statements, whatever their worth in demonstrating congressional intent more\ngenerally, suggest that at least those senators meant for section 3110 to have broad effect\nacross the three branches of government. But because those statements do not speak to\nsection 3110\u2019s relationship to the President\u2019s hiring authority under the annual appropriations for the Executive Office of the President\u2014and, of course, could not speak to the\nrelationship between section 3110 and the later-enacted section 105(a)\u2014they do not\nilluminate the matter at hand. 15 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 41 seeking advice from family members in their personal capacities. Cf. In\nre Cheney, 406 F.3d 723, 728 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (referring to the\nPresident\u2019s need, \u201c[i]n making decisions on personnel and policy, and\nin formulating legislative proposals, . . . to seek confidential information\nfrom many sources, both inside the government and outside\u201d); Pub. Citizen v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 466 (1989) (construing the Federal\nAdvisory Committee Act (\u201cFACA\u201d) not to apply to the judicial recommendation panels of the American Bar Association in order to avoid\n\u201cformidable constitutional difficulties\u201d). Consequently, even if the antinepotism statute prevented the President from employing relatives in the\nWhite House as advisors, he would remain free to consult those relatives\nas private citizens. See Barron Opinion at 8\u20139 (finding the application of\nsection 3110 to presidential advisory committees constitutional in part\nbecause \u201c[t]he President remains free to consult his relatives in their\nprivate, individual capacities at the time and place of, and on the subjects\nof, his choosing\u201d). And our Office has found that such an informal, \u201cessentially personal\u201d advisory relationship, even if the private person offers\nadvice to the President on a \u201cwide variety of issues,\u201d does not make that\nperson an employee of the federal government subject to the conflict of\ninterest laws in title 18.",

Status of an Informal Presidential Advisor as a\n\u201cSpecial Government Employee\u201d, 1 Op. O.L.C. 20, 20\u201321 (1977) (\u201cInformal Presidential Advisor\u201d); see also id. at 22 (\u201cMrs. Carter would not\nbe regarded as a special Government employee solely on the ground that\nshe may discuss governmental matters with the President on a daily basis.\u201d). 7 But the conflict of interest laws do apply to employees of the White\nHouse Office. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 203, 205, 207, 208, 209 (all applicable\nto, inter alia, officers and employees in the \u201cexecutive branch\u201d); id.\n\u00a7 202(e)(1) (defining \u201cexecutive branch\u201d for purposes of those statutes to\ninclude \u201ceach executive agency as defined in title 5, and any other entity 7 Our opinion explained, however, that while the informal presidential advisor\u2019s general practice (as we understood it) of discussing policy issues directly with the President\ndid not itself render him a government employee, his more extensive \u201cwork\u201d on a particular \u201ccurrent social issue\u201d\u2014in connection with which the advisor \u201ccalled and chaired a\nnumber of meetings that were attended by employees of various agencies\u201d and \u201cassumed\nconsiderable responsibility for coordinating the Administration\u2019s activities in that particular area\u201d\u2014did cross a line and made him a government employee for purposes of that\nwork. Informal Presidential Advisor, 1 Op. O.L.C. at 23. 16 Application of Anti-Nepotism Statute to Presidential Appointment in White House or administrative unit in the executive branch\u201d); id. \u00a7 207(c)(2)(A)(iii),\n(d)(1)(C) (applying more stringent post-employment restrictions to\nemployees appointed to the White House Office pursuant to 3 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 105(a)(2)); see also, e.g., Applicability of Post-Employment Restrictions\nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 to a Former Government Official Representing a\nFormer President or Vice President in Connection with the Presidential\nRecords Act, 25 Op. O.L.C. 120 (2001) (considering section 207\u2019s application to former employees of the White House Office). A President wanting a relative\u2019s advice on governmental matters therefore has a choice: to seek that advice on an unofficial, ad hoc basis without conferring the status and imposing the responsibilities that accompany\nformal White House positions; or to appoint his relative to the White\nHouse under title 3 and subject him to substantial restrictions against\nconflicts of interest. Cf. AAPS, 997 F.2d at 911 n.10 (declining, after\nholding that the First Lady qualifies as a \u201cfull-time officer or employee\u201d\nof the government under FACA, to decide her status under the conflict of\ninterest statutes). In choosing his personal staff, the President enjoys an\nunusual degree of freedom, which Congress found suitable to the demands\nof his office. Any appointment to that staff, however, carries with it a set\nof legal restrictions, by which Congress has regulated and fenced in the\nconduct of federal officials. * * * * *",
