September 13, 2005 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE NAVY\nThrough the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, you have asked\nfor our opinion whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(c) (2000) prohibits certain proposed\ncommunications between a retired Navy flag officer, now employed by a\ndefense contractor under contract to provide services to the United States Air\nForce and Army Corps of Engineers in Iraq, and United States Marine Corps\ncommanders. See Letter for Steven G. Bradbury, Acting Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Office of Legal Counsel, from William J. Haynes II, General Counsel,\nDepartment of Defense (Aug. 17, 2005).

Based on the limited\nfactual information available to us, we believe that most of the communications\nproposed by the retired officer fall within section 207(c)\u2019s prohibition and are not\nprotected by the \u201cspecial knowledge\u201d exception. That conclusion, however, does\nnot apply to situations in which the retired officer would do nothing more than\nrequest generally available factual information from MNF-W relating to security\nor other matters relevant to the Company\u2019s work. In the first place, the role contemplated for Mr. Kubic is not that of a behindthe-scenes operative, but rather is a direct and personal one in which Mr. Kubic\nwould be speaking to the Marine Corps officers with the intention that the\ninformation or views conveyed be attributed to him. Accordingly, Mr. Kubic\nwould undoubtedly be making \u201ccommunications\u201d within the meaning of section\n207(c). See \u201cCommunications\u201d Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207, 25 Op. O.L.C. 59, 62\n(2001) (construing section 207(c) to include an attribution requirement). Moreover, as we understand the retired officer\u2019s proposal, the purpose of at\nleast some of those communications would be to persuade the commanders in\nMNF-W to use their forces in ways that the retired officer believes will provide\nbetter protection for both civilian contractors (including the Company\u2019s employees) and military personnel. (We take it that this understanding is what the Rizzo\nLetter means when it refers to \u201cdiscussions regarding scope of work and coordination of on-site activity issues.\u201d Rizzo Letter at 2. 2) Insofar as he seeks to engage in\n2 In your memorandum requesting a legal opinion, you describe the retired officer\u2019s proposal this\nway: \u201cThrough personal communication with local Marine commanders, if authorized, he would seek\nto effect changes in Marine Corps policy or practice regarding the current state of security around 161 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 29 such communications, the retired officer would clearly be \u201ctrying to influence the\nactivities of the agency involved,\u201d and thus would satisfy the scienter and \u201cofficial\naction\u201d requirements of section 207(c).

Direct communications with members of that branch\nby a former senior officer made with the goal of influencing those decisions come\nwithin the scope of section 207(c). A different result follows, however, where the retired officer would merely be\nrequesting generally available factual information from MNF-W commanders. OGE has long taken the position, and we have agreed, that a communication\naimed solely at eliciting generally available information from a government\nagency is not made with the requisite \u201cintent to influence\u201d official agency action,\nand thus is not prohibited by section 207(c). See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2637.204(e); Memorandum for Component Heads, from Timothy E. Flanigan, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Office of Legal Counsel at 8 (Nov. 18, 1992) (noting that section 207(c)\n\u201cdoes not apply to requests for factual information\u201d); Memorandum for Tony\nSchall, Assistant to the Attorney General, from Timothy Flanigan, Principal\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Post Employment Restrictions at 1 (Aug. 15, 1991) (\u201cSchall Memorandum\u201d) (same). The\nretired officer thus remains free under section 207(c) to seek information or advice\nfrom the Marines regarding such matters as the security situation or the steps being\ntaken by the military (or that the Company should take) to protect civilian\ncontractors in Iraq. Although the sparse factual record before us makes it impossible to determine the extent to which the retired officer\u2019s proposed communications\nwould actually fall into this category, it seems that at least some may do so. See,\ne.g., Rizzo Letter at 3 (\u201cthe Parent desires for the retired officer to ask questions\nand seek information related to how the Parent\u2019s employees can better protect\nthemselves.\u201d). We caution the retired officer, however, that especially where he\ncontemplates communicating with Marine Corps officers himself, the line between Camp India and make recommendations about procedures for pursuing the AIF [Anti-Iraqi Forces]\nresponsible for the mortar attacks.\u201d Mora Memorandum at 1.\n3\nThe Office of Government Ethics (\u201cOGE\u201d) regulations contained in 5 C.F.R. pt. 2637 were\nwritten with respect to section 207 as it existed prior to its amendment in 1989, but both OGE and this\nOffice have continued to rely on them when interpreting those portions of the statute that were\nunchanged by the amendments.

Here, because it seems that the retired officer would be speaking not on his own\nbehalf, but rather at the behest and for the benefit of the Company, the statements\nhe proposes to make would clearly satisfy this test. As we understand the situation,\nthe retired officer\u2019s communications with MNF-W would be made in his capacity\nas President of ECCI and would be designed to help improve security in the parts\nof Iraq where the Company\u2019s personnel are working. In that context, it is difficult\nto deny that the retired officer would be acting \u201csubject to the control or direction\u201d\nof the firm, and thereby as the firm\u2019s agent or representative. Boudin Opinion at 6.\nSimply put, in this situation the retired officer would not \u201cspeak[] for himself\nalone.\u201d Gerson Memorandum at 3. Instead, he would speak for the Company and\nhis efforts to use direct communications with his former department to influence\nagency action would fall squarely within the prohibitory terms of section 207(c). Finally, we address the \u201cspecial knowledge\u201d safe harbor contained in section\n207(j)(4). That exception allows a former official to make statements based on the\nindividual\u2019s \u201cown special knowledge,\u201d but only if \u201cno compensation is thereby\nreceived.\u201d Even assuming that the security issues that would be the subject of the\nretired officer\u2019s statements would come within his own special knowledge, we\nagree with OGE that \u201cthe receipt of a salary, or other compensation for doing\none\u2019s job generally, is sufficient, if the statement at issue is made as part of the\n4\nAlthough the Boudin Opinion addressed only 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a), the language it construed\u2014\u201con\nbehalf of any other person\u201d\u2014also appears in section 207(c), where it is used in the same way. Relying\non the interpretive canon that a phrase that appears in multiple places in the same statute should be\ngiven the same meaning in each, we have previously applied the Boudin Opinion\u2019s analysis to section\n207(c).

Rizzo,\nMcKenna, Long & Aldridge LLP, from Marilyn L. Glynn, Acting Director, Office\nof Government Ethics at 5 (June 8, 2005). We think the best reading of the phrase\n\u201cno compensation is thereby received\u201d is that it excludes statements made in the\nordinary course of an agency relationship for which the speaker receives compensation. In other words, if a former official is paid to represent the interests of a\nparticular person or company, and makes statements aimed at advancing that end,\nhe receives compensation \u201cthereby,\u201d even if he is not paid on a statement-bystatement basis. Thus, as a salaried employee of the Company who would be\ncommunicating with the Marine commanders in the course of his employment, the\nretired officer may not take shelter in section 207(j)(4). A contrary conclusion\u2014\nthat a statement may be protected by section 207(j)(4) so long as the speaker is not\npaid specifically for making it\u2014would impermissibly convert the exception into a\nmere accounting rule. It would suggest, for instance, that a lawyer could represent\na client before the same agency where the lawyer was previously a senior official\nso long as he received a flat fee rather than an hourly rate. We do not think\nCongress intended to allow the statutory ban on such communications to be\ncapable of evasion merely by clever bookkeeping. We certainly understand, and are sympathetic to, the retired officer\u2019s pleas that\nhe and his firm face a conflict between the federal ethics laws and the need to take\nsteps to protect his employees from further danger. As described above, however,\nat least some of the communications proposed by Mr. Kubic would be covered by\nthe language of section 207(c). And, although it contains a number of express\nexceptions for particular types of communications, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(j),\nthe statute makes no exception for emergency situations. Nor is there an exception\nfor communications made in war zones involving issues of safety and security. Given that Congress has not seen fit to legislate such exceptions, we are not at\nliberty to interpret such provisions into existence merely to bring about a desirable\nresult. This conclusion about the scope of section 207 does not leave the Company\nunable to communicate with military personnel in Iraq in order to help protect its\npersonnel. Any Company employee not covered by section 207(c) remains free to\ndiscuss security matters (or any other issue) with MNF-W, and certainly may seek\nto persuade the military commanders to take whatever protective actions are\nthought necessary. Indeed, so long as he does not act with the intention that the\nviews or information conveyed to Marine officers be attributed to him, the retired\nofficer may play a \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d role in such communications. \u201cCommunications\u201d Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207, 25 Op.
