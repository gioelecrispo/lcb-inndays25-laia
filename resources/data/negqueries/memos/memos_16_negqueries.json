November 15, 2002 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE DEPUTY COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT You have asked whether Eugene Scalia, now serving as the Solicitor for the\nDepartment of Labor under a recess appointment, could be designated the Acting\nSolicitor after his recess appointment expires. You have asked us to address two\nscenarios. Under the first scenario, Mr Scalia would be given a second position in\nthe non-career Senior Executive Service in the Department of Labor before his\nrecess appointment expires. Under the second scenario, he would be given the\nnon-career Senior Executive Service position in the Department of Labor after his\nrecess appointment expires. We conclude, for the reasons stated below, that under\neither scenario Mr. Scalia could be designated, while serving in his non-career\nSenior Executive Service position, as the Acting Solicitor after his recess\nappointment expires. On April 30, 2001, the President nominated Eugene Scalia to be Solicitor for\nthe Department of Labor. 147 Cong. Rec. 6508 (2001). After the Senate returned\nall pending nominations when it took a long intrasession recess, the President\nnominated Mr. Scalia again on September 4, 2001. 147 Cong. Rec. 16,339 (2001). Once again, the Senate failed to act on the nomination. The President gave Mr.\nScalia a recess appointment during the Senate\u2019s recess from December 20, 2001,\nto January 23, 2002, and submitted his nomination to the Senate on February 5,\n2002. 148 Cong. Rec. 600 (2002). The Senate has not acted upon this last\nnomination, and Mr. Scalia\u2019s recess appointment will expire when the Senate next\nadjourns sine die. U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 3.\nI.\nUnder either scenario, Mr. Scalia would lawfully hold a position in the noncareer Senior Executive Service. To begin with the second scenario: There is no\nquestion that Mr. Scalia may be given a position in the non-career Senior Executive Service in the Department of Labor after his recess appointment as Solicitor\nfor the Department of Labor expires. 1\n1\nIt is possible that an interruption in Mr. Scalia\u2019s government service\u2014i.e., the time between the\nexpiration of his recess appointment and the commencement of his work in the non-career Senior 211 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 221 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26 As for the first scenario: We also believe that Mr. Scalia, while holding the\noffice of Solicitor for the Department of Labor by recess appointment, could\nsimultaneously hold a position in the non-career Senior Executive Service in the\nDepartment of Labor. We have repeatedly concluded that \u201cthere is no longer any\nprohibition against dual office-holding.\u201d",

Schlei, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Fixing of Salary of Director of Office of\nEconomic Opportunity (Aug. 19, 1964). In 1964, Congress repealed a statute\ngenerally barring the holding of more than one office, see Rehnquist Memorandum at 1, and the current statute forbidding the receipt of pay for holding more\nthan one position, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5533 (2000), \u201cimpliedly permits\u201d dual officeholding. Dual Office, 13 Op. O.L.C. at 242. Furthermore, as we have pointed out,\nit is of no consequence if one of the offices to be held is Senate-confirmed and the\nother is not. See Rehnquist Memorandum at 2. A possible limit on the holding of two offices, however, may arise from the\ndoctrine of \u201cincompatibility.\u201d This doctrine, which existed in common law,\n\u201cprecludes a person from holding two offices if public policy would make it\nimproper for the person to perform both functions, such as when the functions of\nthe offices are inconsistent with each other.\u201d Office of Investigative Agency\nPolicies at 6 (citations omitted). \u201cThe doctrine has been stated in various ways,\nsometimes tautologically, but usually states that offices that are incompatible \u2018are\nsuch as bear a special relation to each other; one being subordinate to and interferExecutive Service position\u2014might have certain adverse consequences for him.

Even assuming the continued validity of\nthe doctrine, however, a recess appointee could be appointed to another office as\nlong as \u201c[n]either office, as a matter of statute, reports to the other or reviews\ndeterminations that the other has made.\u201d See Dual Office-Holding at 4.\nUnder the Dual Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5533, the recess appointee could\nreceive the pay for only one of the offices. As we have interpreted the Act, the\nholder of two offices \u201cmust be paid the higher salary if it is fixed by law,\u201d because\nhe \u201cwould otherwise be waiving a right to compensation established pursuant to\nstatute\u2014which is unlawful.\u201d Dual Office, 13 Op. O.L.C. at 243 n.3 (citations\nomitted). 2\nII. Under either of your two scenarios, we believe that, after expiration of his\nrecess appointment, Mr. Scalia may be designated under the Vacancies Reform\nAct, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3345-3349d (2000), to act in the position he will have vacated\nwhen his recess appointment expired. Under the Vacancies Reform Act, the\nPresident \u201cmay direct an officer or employee of [an] Executive agency to perform\nthe functions and duties of [a] vacant [Senate-confirmed] office temporarily in an\nacting capacity,\u201d subject to specified time limits, provided that, during the year\npreceding the occurrence of the vacancy, the officer or employee served for at\nleast 90 days in a position in that agency for which the rate of pay equaled or\nexceeded the rate for GS-15 of the General Schedule. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345(a)(3). By\nvirtue of his non-career Senior Executive Service position with the Department of\nLabor, Mr. Scalia would be \u201can officer or employee\u201d of that agency, and, during\nthe year before the expiration of his recess appointment created a vacancy, he\nwould have served for at least 90 days in a position\u2014the office of Solicitor, to\nwhich he was recess appointed\u2014for which the pay exceeded the GS-15 rate. By 2\nA Senior Executive Salary might, or might not, exceed the Executive Level IV pay of the Solicitor\nof Labor. Salaries in the Senior Executive Service cover a range. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5382(a). The lowest level\nof Senior Executive Service pay, even with a \u201clocality-based comparability\u201d adjustment for Washington, D.C., see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304 (2000), would be less than the pay for Executive Level IV, while the\nhigher levels would exceed the pay for Executive Level IV. 213 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 223 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26",

In our view, neither argument\nis persuasive. The first argument is that, under the Vacancies Reform Act, the relevant vacancy would have occurred when the recess appointee\u2019s predecessor left office and\nthat the recess appointee, unless he qualified by virtue of service in the agency\nbefore then, would not be able to act in the position. The basis for this argument\nwould be the provision of the Vacancies Reform Act stating that the Act is the\nexclusive means for designation of an acting official, with two exceptions\u2014(1) a\nstatute expressly authorizing the President, a court, or a head of a department to\nname an acting official or a statute expressly designating an official to act, or\n(2) the Recess Appointments Clause of the Constitution. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3347(a). According to this argument, the Vacancies Reform Act thus treats a recess\nappointment as identical to an acting designation, and an acting designation does\nnot fill an office but only assigns its duties and powers. The provisions of the\nVacancies Reform Act that allow designations of acting officials but set time\nlimits on their service, for example, contemplate that a \u201cvacancy\u201d occurs when the\noccupant dies or resigns or is otherwise unavailable (except as a result of sickness), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3345-3346, and the departure of an acting official does not\ncreate a new vacancy. So, too, as this argument would go, the expiration of a\nrecess appointment does not create a new vacancy. The language of the Vacancies Reform Act refutes this argument. While the\nstatute provides that an acting official only will \u201cperform the functions and duties\nof the [vacant] office temporarily,\u201d id. \u00a7 3345(a)(1), (2), (3), it states that a recess\nappointment \u201cfill[s] a vacancy,\u201d id. \u00a7 3347(a)(2). Therefore, when the recess\nappointment ends, a new vacancy is created. We accordingly would read the\nstatutory reference to recess appointments as simply making clear that Congress\ndid not intend, by the Vacancies Reform Act, to restrict the President\u2019s recess\nappointment power in any way. The second argument is that, because an acting official has the same duties and\npowers as a recess appointee, a designation to act would extend the recess\nappointment past the constitutionally mandated limit of \u201cthe End of [the Senate\u2019s]\nnext Session.\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. This argument, in our view, would\nignore the differences between holding an office and acting in it. An acting official\ndoes not hold the office, but only \u201cperform[s] the functions and duties of the 3\nA provision of the Vacancies Reform Act that, in some circumstances, forbids an official to act in\na position for which he has been nominated, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345(b)(1), does not apply if an official is\nacting pursuant to the President\u2019s designation.",

He is not \u201cappointed\u201d to the office, but\nonly \u201cdirect[ed]\u201d or authorized to discharge its functions and duties, and he thus\nreceives the pay of his permanent position, not of the office in which he acts. See\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5535(a) (2000). A recess appointee, on the other hand, is appointed by\none of the methods specified in the Constitution itself, see Swan v. Clinton, 100\nF.3d 973, 987 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (recess appointment is not an \u201cinferior\u201d procedure\nto appointment with Senate confirmation); he holds the office; and he receives its\npay. We therefore conclude that a designation to act would not unconstitutionally\nextend the tenure of a recess appointee. Mr. Scalia\u2019s service as Acting Solicitor would be subject to the time limits in\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3346. Ordinarily, an acting official\u2019s service, absent any further action,\nmay continue for 210 days from the occurrence of the vacancy. 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3346(a)(1).

If the Senate does not adjourn sine die before the\nHouse, we believe that the vacancy here would occur \u201cduring an adjournment sine\ndie of the Congress.\u201d The office would be filled at all times that Congress was in\nsession, because the recess appointment would expire \u201cat the End of [the Senate\u2019s] . . . Session.\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 3.\nNotwithstanding the usual 210-day limit, if the President submitted a nomination for the vacant office (including a nomination of Mr. Scalia), Mr. Scalia\u2019s\nservice could continue as long as the nomination was pending in the Senate. Id.\n\u00a7 3346(a)(2). If the Senate rejected or returned the nomination or the President\nwithdrew it, a new 210-day period would begin. Id. \u00a7 3346(b)(1). Once again,\nhowever, if the President submitted a nomination, the service could continue while\nthe nomination was pending. Id. \u00a7 3346(b)(2). Rejection, return, or withdrawal of\nthe nomination would start a final 210-day period, which would not be suspended\nby the President\u2019s making another nomination. Id. \u00a7 3346(b)(2)(B). If any of the\n210-day periods ends when the Senate is not in session, the second day on which\nthe Senate is next in session and is receiving nominations is deemed the last day of\nthe period.
