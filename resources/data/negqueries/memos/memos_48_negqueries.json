T he plain language of \u00a72516(1) authorizes the FBI to participate in court-approved\ninterceptions directed at any of the offenses listed in that section, and the legislative\nhistory lends support to its \u201c plain meaning\u201d interpretation. September 29, 1981\nMEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR\nFOR LEGAL COUNSEL, FED ERA L BUREAU OF\nINVESTIGATION This responds to your request for our opinion whether, pursuant to\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(1)(1976 and Supp. IV 1980), the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) may be authorized by a court to participate in Title\nIII interceptions directed at offenses for which the FBI has no general\ninvestigative responsibility. This legal question has arisen in the context\nof investigations of narcotics-related offenses over which the Drug\nEnforcement Administration (DEA)\u2014not the FBI\u2014has been delegated\ngeneral investigative responsibility by the Attorney General. See United\nStates Attorneys\u2019 Manual, Section 9-1.122 (Oct. 17, 1977); 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 871(a). In particular, in a case in which the DEA seeks authorization\nfor an interception directed at narcotics offenses, and in which there is\nno probable cause to seek authorization for in interception directed at\nother offenses for which the FBI has general investigative responsibil\u00ad\nity, the question is whether the FBI as well as the DEA may be\nauthorized to participate in an interception. If, as the FBI\u2019s Legal\nCounsel Division has concluded, the FBI can participate in a Title III\ninterception only when it has general investigative responsibility for the\noffense at which the interception is directed, then the FBI could not be\nauthorized by a court to participate in an interception in such a case. 1\n1 T he A ttorney General could, if he chose to do so, delegate general investigative jurisdiction over\nnarcotics-related offenses to the FB I. See 21 U.S.C \u00a7 871(a). Unless he does so, however, such\njurisdiction remains with the DEA . [N o t e : In February o f 1982, the Attorney General authorized the\nContinued 286 I. In our view, \u00a7 2516(1) provides authority for the FBI to participate\nin interceptions in such a case directed at any of the offenses listed in\nthat provision, including narcotics-related offenses, so long as all of the\nspecific procedural requirements of \u00a7 2516(1) are satisfied. We conclude\nthat it is not necessary for the FBI to have general investigative\nresponsibility for such offenses before it may participate in court-approved \u00a72516(1) interceptions directed at them. The basis for this\nconclusion is the plain language of \u00a72516(1), which provides in perti\u00ad\nnent part:",

The foregoing language specifically provides that an application may be\nmade to a court for an order approving an interception \u201cby the Federal\nBureau of Investigation, or a Federal agency having responsibility for\nthe investigation of the offense as to which the application is made,\nwhen such interception may provide or has provided evidence of \u201d the\nlisted offenses. In literal terms, this language authorizes the FBI to\nparticipate in court-approved interceptions directed at the listed of\u00ad\nfenses. An interpretation leading to the contrary result would depend on the\npremise that the clause within the commas\u2014\u201cor a Federal agency\nhaving responsibility for the investigation of the offense as to which the\napplication is made,\u201d\u2014refers to the FBI as well as other federal agen\u00ad\ncies, thereby requiring the FBI itself to have \u201cresponsibility\u201d for the\ninvestigation of any offense as to which an interception application is\nmade. That premise lacks specific textual support. 2 We also believe it to\nFBI, concurrently with the DEA, to investigate violations o f the cnminal drug laws of the United\nStates. See A tt\u2019y Gen. Or. No. 968-82, 47 Fed. Reg. 4989 (1982). Ed.\n2 A cardinal principle of statutory construction is that the language used by Congress is to be given\nprimary weight See, e.g.. Southeastern Community College v Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 405 (1979); InternaContinued 287 be contrary to the natural inference to be drawn from the placement of\ncommas around the clause referring to a federal agency having investi\u00ad\ngative \u201cresponsibility,\u201d which renders that clause clearly a subordinate,\nself-contained part of the sentence. No language renders the subordi\u00ad\nnate clause an express qualification on the sentence\u2019s main proposition\nthat the FBI may be authorized to participate in interceptions directed\nat the listed offenses. It would have been simple to provide, had it been\nCongress\u2019 intent to do so, that the FBI may participate in courtapproved interceptions only in those instances where it has investiga\u00ad\ntive \u201cresponsibility\u201d for a given offense and not in those where another\nfederal agency has such \u201cresponsibility.\u201d 3\nII.\nSection 2516(l)\u2019s legislative history lends support to its \u201cplain mean\u00ad\ning\u201d interpretation.

The\nbroad principle stated in the Senate committee report expresses the intent underlying \u00a7 2516(1), not the\nintent underlying other statutes such as 21 U S.C . \u00a7 871(a).

The pertinent language of S. 2050\u2014not that of S. 675\u2014was\nultimately enacted. Thus, the legislative history of \u00a7 2516(1) supports the conclusion\nderived from the provision\u2019s plain language that Congress intended that\nthe FBI may be judicially authorized to engage in an interception\ndirected at any of the listed offenses, including narcotics offenses. III. This interpretation of \u00a72516(1) must be tested against the contrary\narguments advanced in the memorandum of the FBI\u2019s Legal Counsel\nDivision. The memorandum relies not on the provision\u2019s language or\nlegislative history, but rather on a reading of United States v. Marion,\n535 F.2d 697 (2d Cir. 1976), and on an argument said to be based on\nthe general purposes of Title III. The Legal Counsel Division\u2019s memorandum summarizes the Marion\nholding as follows: In focusing on the investigative interests at the time of\ninterception, the Marion court requires separate orders, each\njustifying the agency's investigative jurisdiction, before inter\u00ad\nception is permitted. (Emphasis added.) This reading of Marion suggests that under that decision each agency\nmust have general \u201cinvestigative jurisdiction\u201d over an offense before it\nmay participate in an interception under \u00a72516(1). However, we are\nunable to find support for such a reading in the opinion itself. The\nprecise issue in Marion was whether the requirement of 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2517(5) for subsequent judicial approval of incidental interceptions of\ncommunications relating to offenses other than those specified in an\ninitial wiretap authorization applies to wiretaps initially authorized by\nan order of a state court. 7 The court of appeals held that, in such cases,\nthe requirement of \u00a7 2517(5) does apply. The court explained:\n7 Section 2517(5) provides: When an investigative o r law enforcement officer, while engaged in intercepting\nwire o r oral communications in the manner authorized herein, intercepts wire or oral\ncom munications relating to offenses other than those specified in the order of authori\u00ad\nzation or approval, the contents thereof, and evidence derived therefrom, may be\ndisclosed or used as provided in subsections (1) and (2) o f this section. Such contents\nand any evidence derived therefrom may be used under subsection (3) o f this section when\nContinued 290 . . . our holding does not \u2018call into question\u2019 the practice\nof joint federal-state wiretap investigations. Indeed, Title\nI ll\u2019s framers seem to have specifically envisioned co\u00ad\noperation among law enforcement authorities of different\njurisdictions where appropriate to enhance the effective\u00ad\nness of electronic surveillance operations . . . . If, for\nexample, federal officials called into an ongoing state\nwiretap operation learned at that time of communications\nrelating to separate federal offenses not specified in the\ninitial interception order, there would be little difficulty in\nobtaining the requisite subsequent approval pursuant to\n\u00a72517. And where federal and state officers pursue an\ninvestigation jointly from its inception, we foresee little\ndifficulty for the appropriate federal officer to obtain a\nseparate order authorizing the interception of communica\u00ad\ntions relating to the federal offenses believed involved. 8",

It simply did\nnot deal with, and reached no conclusion about, the precise issue before\nus regarding \u00a7 2516(1). A broader argument in the Legal Counsel Division\u2019s memorandum is\nthat a construction of \u00a72516(1) permitting the FBI to participate in\ncourt-authorized interceptions relating to all offenses enumerated in that\nprovision would be in tension with Title Ill\u2019s underlying purposes,\nwhich include placing restrictions on interceptions in order to protect\ncitizens\u2019 privacy interests. To be consistent with such a purpose, courts\nhave noted that Title III should be carefully construed. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Giordano, 469 F.2d 522, 530 (4th Cir. 1972), affd, 416 U.S.\n505 (1974). The Legal Counsel Division suggests that in order to be\nconsistent with this. canon of careful construction, it is necessary to\ninterpret \u00a7 2516(1) as not allowing the FBI to participate in an intercep\u00ad\ntion unless it has general investigative responsibility for the offense at\nwhich an interception is directed. We agree that Title III, and hence \u00a72516(1), must be carefully\nconstrued. We do not agree, however, that such a construction must\ninclude reading language into \u00a72516(1) that is not there, especially\nwhen the legislative history shows that one of the two major bills\nauthorized or approved by a judge o f competent jurisdiction where such judge finds on\nsubsequent application that the contents were otherwise intercepted in accordance with the\nprovisions o f this chapter. Such application shall be made as soon as practicable. [Em\u00ad\nphasis added.]\n8 535 F.2d at 707. Cf. United States v. Manfredi, 488 F.2d 588, 601 (2d Cir. 1973), cert, denied 417\nU.S. 936 (1974) (noting that 18 U.S.C. \u00a72517 authorizes disclosure to appropriate law enforcement\nofficials of evidence gained as a result o f an authorized wiretap, and concluding: \u201c If such information\nmay be exchanged after the termination o f the surveillance, we perceive no reason why that informa\u00ad\ntion may not be disclosed to cooperating agencies contemporaneously with its interception \u201d ); United\nStates v Masciarelti. 558 F.2d 1064, 1067-68 (2d Cir. 1977); United Stales v.

Md. 1979). 291 before Congress when it passed Title III contained language that would\nhave led to the result suggested by the Legal Counsel Division, but\nCongress did not adopt it. The most fundamental canon of statutory\nconstruction is that plain language should control, especially in the\nabsence of contrary legislative history. 9 The Legal Counsel Division\nhas not pointed to such contrary legislative history. Nor have we\nbecome aware of any. Furthermore, although it is plain that in enacting Title III Congress\nwas sensitive to the need to protect citizens\u2019 privacy interests, it does\nnot follow from this alone that \u00a72516(1) must be read in the manner\nsuggested by the Legal Counsel Division.",

The \u201cpurposive\u201d approach o f the Legal Counsel Division\u2019s\nmemorandum does not ultimately assist in answering that question. Another argument might have been made to support the position of\nthe Legal Counsel Division. Section 2516(1) specifically refers to the\nprocedures in \u00a72518 governing orders authorizing interceptions, and\n\u00a7 2518(l)(a) states that an application must identify \u201cthe investigative or\nlaw enforcement officer\u201d making the application for an interception. 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2510(7) defines the term \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement\nofficer\u201d to include \u201cany officer o f the United States or of a State or\npolitical subdivision thereof, who is empowered by law to conduct investi\u00ad\ngations o f or to make arrests fo r offenses enumerated in this chapter, and\nany attorney authorized by law to prosecute or participate in the\nprosecution of such offenses . . .\n(Emphasis added.)

That is, of course, the question to be answered. It cannot be\nresolved simply by stating conclusorily that \u00a7 2516(1) could not be read\nto empower the FBI to participate in court-approved interceptions\ndirected at the offenses listed in it. As noted above, under \u00a72516(l)\u2019s\nmost natural reading it in fact does authorize the FBI to participate in\ncourt-approved interceptions directed at any of the offenses listed in it. IV. For all the reasons stated in this opinion, we do not read \u00a7 2516(1) to\nrequire the FBI to have general investigative responsibility for an\noffense listed in that subsection before the FBI may be judicially au\u00ad\nthorized to participate in an interception directed at such an offense,\nincluding narcotics offenses. Accordingly, in the type of case that gave\nrise to your opinion request to this Office, we conclude that, under\n\u00a72516(1), the FBI may be judicially authorized to participate in a\ncourt-approved interception directed at an offense noted in that provi\u00ad\nsion.
