By its terms,\nthe Act applies only to a Senate-confirmed office \u201c of an Executive agency.\u201d We\nbelieve that the better view, based on the information provided by the Treasury\nDepartment, is that the U.S. representatives are not part of an \u201c Executive agency\u201d\nand are therefore not covered by the Act.

The Treasury Department has informed us that the USEDs and Alternate\nUSEDs at the IMF and the World Bank are similar with regard to the relevant\nfacts discussed in this opinion.

The Federal Vacancies Reform A ct\nExcept for those offices expressly exempted by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3349c, the Vacancies\nReform Act applies to any vacancy in an office of an \u201c Executive agency\u201d to\nwhich appointment is required to be made by the President, with the advice and\nconsent of the Senate. 2 The USED and the Alternate USED are both appointed\nby the President, with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7286a(a), (b),\nand neither office is expressly excluded from coverage by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3349c. Accordingly, the critical issue in determining whether the Vacancies Reform Act\napplies to the USED and the Alternate USED is whether they are officers \u201c of\nan Executive agency\u2019 \u2019 within the Act. The use of the phrase \u201c of an Executive agency\u201d imposes a meaningful limita\u00ad\ntion on the scope of the Act. \u201c Executive agency\u201d is a specific, defined term\nin title 5, and is narrower than the executive branch as a whole. See Haddon\nv. W alters, 43 F.3d 1488 (D.C. Cir. 1995). The Vacancies Reform Act incorporates\nthe title 5 definition of an \u201c Executive agency,\u201d except that the Act adds the\nExecutive Office of the President to the definition and excludes the General\nAccounting Office. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345(a); see also S. Rep. No. 105-250, at 12\n(1998) (\u201c \u2018Executive agency\u2019 is defined at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 105.\u201d ); Guidance on\nApplication o f Federal Vacancies Reform A ct o f 1998, 23 Op. O.L.C. 60, 6162 (1999). By its plain language, therefore, the Act does not necessarily reach\nall Senate-confirmed offices, but only those in \u201c an Executive agency.\u201d To be sure, at least one statement in the legislative history of the Act could\nsupport the proposition that Congress intended to cover all Senate-confirmed\noffices in the executive branch, except for those offices expressly excluded by\n\u00a7 3349c:\nSection 3345 states that the provisions of the Act will apply to any\nofficer in any executive agency, other than the General Accounting\nOffice, if that officer\u2019s appointment is made by the President, sub\u00ad\nject to the advice and consent of the Senate. Unlike current law,\nthis change w ill make clea r that the Vacancies Act, as amended\nby this legislation, applies to all executive branch officers whose\nappointm ent requires Senate confirmation, except fo r those officers\ndescribed in Section 3349c. 144 Cong.

C. Are the United States Executive D irector and Alternate United States Executive\nD irector Part o f the Department o f the Treasury? Because the Department of the Treasury is an Executive department, see 5\nU.S.C. \u00a7 101, an officer in the Department of the Treasury is an officer of an\nExecutive agency within the Act. Cf. Memorandum for Files, from Daniel L.\nKoffsky, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re:\nPermanent Representative to the United Nations (July 14, 1998) (\u201c 1998 UN\nMemo\u201d ) (concluding that the United States Permanent Representative to the\nUnited Nations is in the State Department and therefore an officer of an Executive\nagency). The information provided to us by the Treasury Department indicates\nthat the Treasury Department has a more direct and substantial relationship with\nthe U.S. representatives to the IMF than does any other Executive department. If the U.S. representatives are within any Executive department, that department\nwould be the Treasury Department. Although the issue is not entirely free from doubt, we conclude that, on balance,\nthe better view is that the USED and the Alternate USED are not in the Depart\u00ad\nment of the Treasury. In an Appendix, we set out the factors relevant to the anal\u00ad\nysis. Some of these factors strongly indicate that the U.S. representatives are not\npart of the Treasury Department. Although others might suggest that the U.S.\nrepresentatives are in the Treasury Department, a closer examination reveals that\nthe relationship of the U.S. representatives to the Treasury Department is quite\nlimited in scope and frequently ambiguous even within that limited area. For some of the most central elements of personnel administration, the U.S.\nrepresentatives are unconnected to the Department o f the Treasury. The Treasury\nDepartment is not responsible for setting or paying the salaries of the U.S. rep\u00ad\nresentatives. See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7286a(d). Nor does the Treasury Department carry\nthe U.S. representatives on its employment rolls. Furthermore, the staff for the\nU.S. representatives are not Treasury Department employees, but instead are\nemployees of the IMF; and if they come to the IMF from the Treasury Depart\u00ad\nment, they are officially separated from the Treasury Department, removed from\n61 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 24 the Treasury Department\u2019s employment rolls, and transferred to the employment\nof the IM F.3\nThe Vacancies Reform Act appears in Title 5 and uses Title 5\u2019s definition of\n\u201c Executive agency.\u201d",

If, for these\nessential aspects of personnel administration, the U.S. representatives have no\nconnection to the Treasury Department, the compelling implication is that the U.S.\nrepresentatives are not located in the Treasury Department. The strongest factor potentially arguing in favor of the view that the U.S. rep\u00ad\nresentatives to the IMF are part o f the Treasury Department is that they receive\ntheir instructions through the Secretary of the Treasury. See, e.g., Exec. Order\nNo. 11269, at \u00a73(a), reprinted in 22 U.S.C. \u00a7286b note (delegating to the Sec\u00ad\nretary the President\u2019s authority to instruct United States representatives to the\ninternational financial organizations). This factor alone, however, does not mean\nthat the U.S. representatives to the IMF are part of the Treasury Department. By\nstatute, the power to instruct is vested in the President, not the Secretary of\nTreasury. As a practical matter, the President cannot personally perform all of\nthe duties for which he is ultimately responsible, and here he has chosen to dele\u00ad\ngate the task of conveying the Government\u2019s instructions. That the President has\ndetermined that the Secretary of Treasury is best suited to be principally respon\u00ad\nsible for providing the instructions to the U.S. representatives cannot, as a legal\nmatter, make the U.S. representatives part of the Treasury Department. Moreover, the history by which the Secretary became responsible for instructing\nthe U.S. representatives to the IM F is consistent with the view that they are not\npart of the Treasury Department. Originally, in the Bretton Woods Agreements\nAct of 1945, Congress made the National Advisory Council on International\nMonetary and Financial Problems responsible for instructing the U.S. representa\u00ad\ntives, under the general direction of the President. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 286b(b)(4). In 1965,\nPresident Johnson abolished the Council and transferred to himself all of its func\u00ad\ntions, including the responsibility for instructing the U.S. representatives to the\nIMF. Reorg. Plan No. 4 of 1965, at \u00a7\u00a7 1(b) & 3(a), reprinted in 5 U.S.C. app.\nat 1519 (1994). In a 1966 Executive Order, the President delegated to the Sec\u00ad\nretary of Treasury the authority to instruct the representatives. Exec. Order No.\n11269, at \u00a73(a), reprinted in 22 U.S.C. \u00a7286b note. It thus seems quite unlikely\nthat the U.S. representatives would originally have been considered within the\nDepartment of the Treasury; and nothing in the later history of the President\u2019s\ndelegation to the Secretary o f his authority to instruct the U.S. representatives\nindicates that, in addition to delegating the authority to instruct, the President\n3 On rare occasions, additional Treasury employees, beyond the usual staff of the U.S. representatives, may be\ndetailed to the IMF.

Nor does Congress\u2019s passage, after the Executive\nOrder, of statutes directing or authorizing the Secretary to instruct the U.S. rep\u00ad\nresentatives as to certain specific issues, see, e.g., 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7262h, 262k(b),\n262m-2(b), 286a(d)(3), 286e-8, 286e-13, show any intent to alter the administra\u00ad\ntive location of the U.S. representatives. These statutes appear to reflect the reality\nof the delegation made by the Executive Order, rather than any unstated intent\nto move the U.S. representatives into the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department has some responsibility for the bookkeeping and\nagency contributions associated with the U.S. representatives\u2019s receipt of certain\nemployment benefits, see 22 U.S.C. \u00a7276c-2 (Supp. IV 1998), but the provision\nassigning this task ultimately serves to demonstrate that the U.S. representatives\nare not otherwise part of the Treasury Department. Under \u00a7276c-2, \u201c [t]he\nTreasury Department shall serve as the employing office\u201d in administering the\nemployment benefits. If the U.S. representatives were already part of the Treasury\nDepartment, there would be no need for the statute to specifically denominate\nTreasury as the employing office, because it would already be the employing\noffice as a result of the administrative location of the U.S. representatives. 4 Finally, although the Treasury Department gives ethics advice to the U.S. rep\u00ad\nresentatives, we have been informed that it does not do so as a result of any\ndetermination that it is legally required to take this role. Furthermore, the Secretary\nof Treasury, we understand, probably has never been asked to grant the U.S. rep\u00ad\nresentatives a waiver under the authority of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208 (1994), as delegated\nby the President to agency heads with respect to Presidential appointees in their\nagencies, see Exec. Order No. 12731, \u00a7401, 3 C.F.R. 306 (1991). As these factors show, the determination whether the U.S. representatives are\npart of the Treasury Department requires fact-specific analysis, and the limited\nsituations in which this Office has previously addressed whether an officer or\nentity is part of an Executive department do not present perfect analogies. Never\u00ad\ntheless, we believe that our prior advice in those cases is consistent with the\nconclusion here that the U.S. representatives are not part of the Treasury Depart\u00ad\nment.

Further, \u00a727 6 c-2 places \u201c in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury\u201d\nthe decision whether to provide these benefits to the U.S. representatives It would arguably be anomalous for Con\u00ad\ngress to vest the Secretary with such discretion regarding the benefits of U.S. representatives if they were part\nof Treasury, since that discretion does not exist as to other employees and officers of the Treasury Department While we tend to think that this is further evidence that the U.S representatives are not within the Treasury Depart\u00ad\nment, we also recognize that there is a counter argument to this line o f reasoning \u2014 namely, that an express grant\nof benefits was necessary to overcome the prohibition in 22 U S C \u00a7286a(d)(l) on any person\u2019s receiving \u201c any\nsalary or other compensation from the United States\u201d for serving as an Executive Director or Alternate at the IMF\nor World Bank.

We noted, among other factors, that\nthe State Department exercises fiscal control over the Mission through control\nof the M ission\u2019s appropriations; the Permanent Representative is carried on the\nState Department\u2019s employment rolls; there is a \u201c home desk\u201d for the Mission\nwithin the State Department; the administrative officers within the State Depart\u00ad\nment treat the Permanent Representative as an official of the Department; the State\nDepartment handles the FOIA, whistleblower, and ethics work for the Mission;\nand the Inspector General for the State Department exercises jurisdiction over the\nMission. See 1996 UN Memo at 2; 1998 UN Memo at 2. As demonstrated above\nand in the information in the Appendix, these factors are generally not present\nwith regard to the U.S. representatives.

Do the United States Representatives to the IMF Constitute an Independent\nEstablishment? Because the U.S. representatives to the IMF are neither in a Government cor\u00ad\nporation nor part of an executive department, they are part of an Executive agency\nonly if they are an independent establishment. Section 104 defines an independent\nestablishment as follows: \u201c For the purpose of this title, \u2018independent establish\u00ad\nment\u2019 means \u2014 (1) an establishment in the executive branch (other than the United\nStates Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission) which is not an Executive\ndepartment, military department, Government corporation, or part thereof, or part\nof an independent establishment; and (2) the General Accounting Office.\u201d 5\nU.S.C. \u00a7 104.",

      "content": "While this definition is quite broad, its plain language requires that\na collection of offices meet three requirements in order to constitute an inde\u00ad\npendent establishment: (1) it must be an \u201c establishment\u201d ; (2) it must be \u201c in the\nexecutive branch\u201d ; and (3) it must not be a part of an Executive department,\nmilitary department, Government corporation, or another independent establish\u00ad\nment. The U.S. representatives to the IMF can satisfy the third requirement, but\nnot the first two. Accordingly, we conclude that they are not an independent\nestablishment within the meaning of \u00a7 104. To the extent that the U.S. representatives are an indivisible part of the IMF,\nthey would only be part of an independent establishment if the IMF is itself an\nindependent establishment. The IMF, however, is not within the executive branch. It is instead an international institution made up of representatives from over 180\nmember countries. See OPM Opin. at 3 (\u201c IMF clearly is not within the Executive\nBranch\u201d ). As a result, IMF as a whole cannot constitute an independent establish\u00ad\nment. Further, while the U.S. representatives may be officers in the executive branch,\nsee OPM Opin., their \u201c office\u201d at IMF does not constitute an \u201c establishment.\u201d The term \u201c establishment\u201d embodies the idea of a free-standing entity with its\nown structure and unity. For example, one dictionary defines \u201c establishment,\u201d\nin relevant part, as follows:\nc: a permanent civil or military force or organization; d: a more\nor less fixed and usu. sizable place of business or residence together\nwith all the things that are an essential part of it (as grounds, fur\u00ad\n6 Nor is our conclusion here inconsistent with O PM \u2019s conclusion that the Alternate USED is within the executive\nbranch for the purpose of qualifying for SES benefits OPM Opin at 3-5. The question whether a position is within\nthe executive branch is different from whether it is within the Treasury Department or whether the U.S representa\u00ad\ntives constitute an independent establishment. Moreover, OPM, in discussing persons who went from Treasury to\nbe the Alternate USEDs, states that, although they never left the executive branch, they left the Treasury Department.

The office of the U.S. representatives is not of this char\u00ad\nacter. It is not in any sense an independent, free-standing establishment. It is\ninstead a component part of the IMF. The office is fully funded by the IMF,\nwith the IMF setting and paying the compensation of the U.S. representatives\nand their staff, as well as the office\u2019s operating expenses. The office, moreover,\nwith the exception of the U.S. representatives, is staffed by employees of the\nIMF who owe their principal obligations to the IMF, rather than the federal\ngovernment.",

Conclusion We recognize that Congress may not have had any specific intent to exclude\nthese offices from the scope of the Vacancies Reform Act. By its terms, however,\nthe Vacancies Reform Act applies only to vacancies in Senate confirmed offices\nthat are part of an \u201c Executive agency.\u201d While this defined term is quite broad\nand includes almost all Senate confirmed, executive branch offices, its use in the\nAct has the consequence that, to be covered by the Act, an office must be not\njust an office in the executive branch, but an office in an Executive department,\nGovernment corporation, or independent establishment. Because the U.S. rep\u00ad\nresentatives to the IMF are not part of an Executive department, Government cor\u00ad\nporation, or independent establishment, vacancies in those offices are not covered\nby the Vacancies Reform Act. We stress, however, that the category of executive\nbranch offices that are not part of an Executive agency is extremely narrow.

See, e.g., Exec.\nOrder No. 11269, at \u00a73(a), reprinted as amended in 22 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 286b note; 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7262h, 262k(b), 286a(d)(3). * The U.S. representatives are eligible, in the discretion of the\nSecretary of the Treasury, to receive employee benefits: \u201c Notwith\u00ad\nstanding the provisions of any other law, [U.S. representatives at\ninternational financial organizations] shall, if they are citizens of\nthe United States, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury,\neach be eligible on the basis of such service and the total compensa\u00ad\ntion received therefor, for all employee benefits afforded employees\nin the civil service of the United States.\u201d 22 U.S.C. \u00a7276c-2; see\nalso OPM Opinion, at 3 n.2 (Alternate USED eligible, in the discre\u00ad\ntion of the Secretary, for SES retirement benefits and health, life,\nand disability coverage). * Section 276c-2 further provides: \u201c The Treasury Department\nshall serve as the employing office fo r collecting, accounting for,\nand depositing in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund,\nEmployees Life Insurance Fund, and Employees Health Benefits\nFund, all retirement and health insurance benefits payments made\nby these employees, and shall make any necessary agency contribu\u00ad\ntions from funds appropriated to the Department of the Treasury.\u201d\n22 U.S.C. \u00a7 276c-2 (emphasis added). * Treasury provides ethics advice to the U.S. representatives,\nsince the U.S. representatives do not have an internal source for\nsuch advice, and the U.S. representatives are directed to file disclo\u00ad\nsure forms and generally to comport themselves as if covered by\nthe ethics rules. Nevertheless, the Treasury Department does not\nperform these functions as a result of any determination that it is\nlegally required to take this role, and Treasury seriously doubts that\nit has ever been asked to provide a \u00a7 208(b) waiver to any USED\nor Alternate USED. 8 Except for various of the statutory references, this information was provided to us by the Department of the\nTreasury 69 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 24 * The salaries of the U.S. representatives are set and paid by the\nIMF. See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7286a(d)(l) ( \u201c No person shall be entitled to\nreceive any salary or other compensation from the United States\nfor services as a Governor, executive director, councillor, alternate,\nor associate.\u201d ).",

The secretaries who work in the office\nare employed by the IMF. The office also typically includes an\nadvisor and two or three assistants who are usually from Treasury. These individuals are transferred to the IMF under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n(1994 & Supp. IV 1998). Upon being transferred to the IMF, these\nindividuals are separated from Treasury and are no longer Treasury\nemployees.

The only elements of employ\u00ad\nment that they retain are re-employment rights and the right to\ncount their years of service at the IMF toward retirement eligi\u00ad\nbility. 9\n* In a few instances, Treasury employees have also been detailed\nto the office of the U.S. representatives under 5 U.S.C. \u00a73343\n(1994) when there was a pressing need for additional assistance. These details are rare and have generally only been for short\nperiods of time. * The IMF receives an annual lump-sum contribution from the\nUnited States.

More specifically,\nTreasury indicated that it does not ask the U.S. representatives for\ndocuments in responding to FOIA requests addressed to Treasury\nif, e.g., the request concerns questions about the international finan\u00ad\ncial organizations.
