To comply with the Single Convention,\nDEA\u2019s licensing framework must provide for a system in which DEA or its legal agent\nhas physical possession and ownership over the cultivated marijuana and assumes control of the distribution of marijuana no later than four months after harvesting. June 6, 2018 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE ACTING CHIEF COUNSEL\nDRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION Under the Controlled Substances Act, the Attorney General is authorized to license marijuana cultivation if he determines that it would be\n\u201cconsistent with the public interest and with United States obligations\nunder international treaties, conventions, or protocols in effect on May 1,\n1971.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(a). Such obligations include those under the\nSingle Convention on Narcotic Drugs (\u201cSingle Convention\u201d), Mar. 30,\n1961, 18 U.S.T. 1407. As relevant here, the Single Convention requires\nparties either to prohibit marijuana cultivation altogether or, if they permit\ncultivation, to establish \u201ca single government agency\u201d to oversee marijuana growers and generally to monopolize the wholesale trade in the marijuana crop. Id. arts. 22, 23(3), 28(1). That single agency must strictly\nregulate any lawful cultivation of marijuana by, among other things, \u201cpurchas[ing] and tak[ing] physical possession of [the] crops as soon as possible, but not later than four months after the end of the harvest.\u201d Id. art.\n23(2)(d). This opinion considers whether the Drug Enforcement Administration\n(\u201cDEA\u201d), which exercises the Attorney General\u2019s licensing authority,\nmust alter existing licensing practices to comply with the Single Convention. At present, DEA does not purchase or take physical possession of\nlawfully grown marijuana at any point in the distribution process. Instead,\nthe only currently licensed marijuana cultivator grows and distributes the\nmarijuana itself pursuant to a contract with, and under the supervision of,\nthe National Institute on Drug Abuse (\u201cNIDA\u201d), a component of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\u2019 National Institutes of Health. In 2016, DEA revised this process and announced that it would increase\nthe number of licensees and supervise the additional growers itself. 1 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 42 See Applications To Become Registered Under the Controlled Substances\nAct To Manufacture Marijuana To Supply Researchers in the United\nStates, 81 Fed. Reg. 53,846, 53,848 (Aug. 12, 2016) (\u201cApplications To\nManufacture Marijuana\u201d). Under the new policy, DEA would not purchase or possess the marijuana before licensees distributed it to government-approved researchers. Several entities have applied for licenses\nunder the new policy, but no applications have been approved. We conclude that DEA must change its current practices and the policy\nit announced in 2016 to comply with the Single Convention. DEA must\nadopt a framework in which it purchases and takes possession of the\nentire marijuana crop of each licensee after the crop is harvested. In\naddition, DEA must generally monopolize the import, export, wholesale\ntrade, and stock maintenance of lawfully grown marijuana. 1",

See Applications To Manufacture\nMarijuana, 81 Fed. Reg. at 53,846\u201348. Under the new policy, a grower, if\napproved for a license, would \u201cbe permitted to operate independently,\nprovided the grower agrees (through a written memorandum of agreement\nwith DEA) that it will only distribute marijuana with prior, written approval from DEA.\u201d Id. at 53,848. NIDA would not be involved in monitoring the additional licensees. We understand that DEA has several\ncurrently pending requests from entities that seek to register as marijuana\ngrowers under that policy. II. Under the CSA, DEA may register an applicant to cultivate marijuana\nonly if the registration scheme is consistent with the Single Convention. We address whether DEA\u2019s practices and policy for licensing marijuana\ncultivation comply with the Single Convention and, if not, what changes\nDEA must make to conform to the treaty. A.\nAn international agreement has the force of domestic U.S. law if it\nis self-executing or if Congress has implemented it by legislation. See\nMedell\u00edn v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 504\u201305 (2008). Here, Congress has\nexecuted the Single Convention in the CSA. In that Act, Congress provided that the Attorney General \u201cshall\u201d license the cultivation of marijuana\n\u201cif he determines that such registration is consistent with . . . United\nStates obligations under international treaties, conventions, or protocols\nin effect on May 1, 1971.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(a).4 The Attorney General is\nthus required to determine that the licensing scheme is consistent with the\nSingle Convention before exercising his authority to register an applicant\nto cultivate marijuana. See Control of Papaver Bracteatum, 1 Op. O.L.C.\nat 99; Memorandum for John E. Ingersoll, Director, Bureau of Narcotics\nand Dangerous Drugs, from Mary C. Lawton, Deputy Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Office of Legal Counsel, Petition to Decontrol Marihuana\u2014\n4 The Single Convention was amended by a 1972 protocol, but the amendments are not\nmaterial to the obligations discussed in this opinion. See Protocol Amending the Single\nConvention on Narcotic Drugs, Mar. 25, 1972, 26 U.S.T. 1439. 6 Licensing Marijuana Cultivation Interpretation of Section 201 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970,\nat 4 (Aug. 21, 1972) (\u201c[I]n making determinations as to the fitness of\nregistrants to receive licenses for manufacture or export and import of\ncontrolled substances, the Attorney General is instructed to ensure consistency \u2018with United States obligations under international treaties.\u2019\u201d). Article 23(2) of the Single Convention, made applicable to marijuana\ncultivation by Article 28, contains five requirements for the supervision,\nlicensing, and distribution of marijuana. See Single Convention art.\n23(2)(a)\u2013(e). Under current regulations and practice, DEA satisfies the\nfirst three requirements. The Convention specifies that the agency must\ndesignate the land on which cannabis cultivation is permitted, limit cultivators to those licensed by the agency, and specify the extent of the land\non which cultivation is permitted.

DEA establishes annual production quotas for lawful marijuana cultivation, and it has exercised that authority by setting the annual\nquotas for the National Center, the only entity ever registered by DEA to\ngrow marijuana to supply researchers in the United States. 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 826; 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1303.11. DEA has ample authority under this framework to specify the areas and circumstances under which a licensee may\ncultivate marijuana and in fact satisfies the first three requirements of\nArticle 23(2) of the Single Convention in registering applicants under the\nCSA pursuant to those requirements. Article 23 of the Single Convention also imposes control requirements\nbeyond those currently carried out by DEA. Under Article 23(2)(d), \u201call\ncultivators shall be required to deliver their total crops\u201d to the agency, and\nthe agency \u201cshall purchase and take physical possession of such crops as\nsoon as possible, but not later than four months after the end of the harvest.\u201d Article 23(2)(e) requires the agency to \u201chave the exclusive right of\nimporting, exporting, wholesale trading and maintaining stocks.\u201d The\nUnited States currently attempts to comply with those requirements\nthrough NIDA\u2019s contract with the National Center, under which NIDA\u2019s\ncontracting officials supervise the National Center\u2019s cultivation of marijuana and distribution of marijuana to researchers. Article 23\u2019s final requirement, however, provides that the \u201cgovernmental functions\u201d in Article\n23(2) must be \u201cdischarged by a single government agency if the constitution of the Party concerned permits it.\u201d Single Convention art. 23(3).\n7 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 42 We conclude that the existing licensing framework departs from Article\n23 in three respects. First, the division of responsibilities between DEA\nand NIDA, a component of the Department of Health and Human Services\n(\u201cHHS\u201d), contravenes Article 23(2)\u2019s requirement that all Article 23\nfunctions be carried out by a single government agency. Second, neither\nof the two government agencies \u201ctake[s] physical possession\u201d of the\nmarijuana grown by the National Center, as required by Article 23(2)(d). Third, no federal agency exercises a monopoly over the wholesale trade in\nmarijuana, as required by Article 23(2)(e). We discuss each departure in\nturn. 1.\nCurrent practice diverges from the Single Convention\u2019s requirement\nthat a single agency undertake each of the listed control functions unless\nthe constitution of the treaty party forbids it. As explained, DEA is responsible for the controls required by Article 23(2)(a), (b), and (c) because it effectively designates the area where marijuana cultivation is\npermitted, limits cultivators to those licensed by the agency, and speci fies the extent of the land on which cultivation is permitted. NIDA, for\nits part, attempts to satisfy the physical-possession and governmentmonopoly-control requirements of Article 23(2)(d) and (e) by supervising\ncultivation under its contract with the National Center. That division of\nauthority is contrary to Article 23(3), because nothing in the Constitution\nwould preclude the United States from discharging all of those controls\nthrough one government agency.",

See State Mem. at 5. But we do\nnot believe that NIDA acts for DEA, and it is unlikely that DEA could\nlawfully supervise NIDA in the performance of its functions. We are\naware of no statute that gives DEA that authority. And the President may\nnot delegate to DEA his constitutional authority to supervise NIDA in the\nexercise of its statutory responsibilities. See Centralizing Border Control\nPolicy Under the Attorney General, 26 Op.

Single Convention art. 23(2)(d). As noted above, NIDA contracts with, and partially\noversees, the cultivation of marijuana by the National Center, which is\nlicensed by DEA. But under that contractual arrangement, neither NIDA\nnor DEA takes physical possession of the marijuana. Rather, the National\nCenter itself stores the marijuana on the premises of the University of\nMississippi and ships it to researchers approved by DEA. Neither NIDA\nnor DEA accepts delivery of the harvested crops. That contractual arrangement does not satisfy the United States\u2019 obligations under Article\n23(d). The contract at most results in a federal government agency\u2019s having constructive, rather than physical, possession of the marijuana crop. a. The Single Convention does not define \u201cphysical possession.\u201d In construing that term we should \u201cbegin with the text of the treaty and the\ncontext in which the written words are used.\u201d Water Splash, Inc. v.

And the contract provides for federal monitoring of compliance by the NIDA representative, although that supervision occurs\nprimarily from NIDA\u2019s headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland. Id. at 16, 26,\n34. But the control that NIDA exercises through these contractual provisions amounts at most to constructive possession of the marijuana, and is\nthus insufficient to meet the treaty requirement of physical possession by\nthe federal government. In particular, this requirement demands that the government have physical control over the crop. Because a government acts through its agents,\nthat mandate means the marijuana must be delivered to government\nagents who must have personal and direct physical access to the crops in\nquestion, and not simply the ability or power to obtain access to them. b. It could be argued that the National Center\u2019s employees are acting as\nfederal government agents, and that the federal government physically\npossesses marijuana grown by the National Center through those employees. But in a similar context, for purposes of asking whether the federal\ngovernment is liable for the actions of a contractor under the Federal Tort\nClaims Act, the Supreme Court has emphasized that requiring compliance\nwith \u201cfederal standards and regulations\u201d or contract terms that \u201cfix specific and precise conditions to implement federal objectives\u201d does not suffice to \u201cconvert the acts of [contractors] into federal governmental acts.\u201d United States v.

For analogous reasons, the National Center\u2019s employees are not agents\nof the federal government. The parameters of the contract do not provide\nfor DEA or NIDA to supervise closely the day-to-day physical operations\nof the National Center\u2019s distribution and storage functions. And the NIDA\ncontract disavows the notion that it creates an agency relationship.

Applications To Manufacture Marijuana, 81 Fed. Reg. at\n53,847. The suggestion is that the National Center itself operates as the\nfederal government in carrying out the controls required by the Single\nConvention. The question of whether an entity is part of the federal government turns on a variety of factors, including whether the government\nowns the entity; whether the government appoints its officers and directors; whether Congress has defined its corporate purposes or appropriated\nfunds for its operations; and whether the entity is controlled by or operates for the benefit of the federal government. See Dep\u2019t of Transp. v.\nAss\u2019n of Am. Railroads, 575 U.S. 43, 51\u201355 (2015); United States v.

Under those factors, the National Center is not an extension of the federal government. The National Center is part of the University of Mississippi, located on campus in a university-owned building, and run by its\nown employees. It does not operate solely for a federal purpose, but\ninstead was established to help the University conduct \u201cresearch to discover and develop natural products for use as pharmaceuticals, dietary\nsupplements and agrochemicals, and to understand the biological and\nchemical properties of medicinal plants.\u201d National Center for Natural\nProducts Research, About NCNPR, https://pharmacy.olemiss.edu/ncnpr/\nabout-ncnpr/ (last visited June 6, 2018). While the federal government\npays the National Center to grow marijuana and exercises some supervision over its growing operations, the government does not generally fund\nor control the National Center. That the National Center may physically\npossess the marijuana it grows, then, does not satisfy the federal government\u2019s obligation to do so.8\n8 The Supreme Court has cautioned against applying \u201cbackground principle[s] of\nAmerican law\u201d that are \u201crelevant to the interpretation of federal statutes\u201d but were not\nnecessarily adopted by the signatories to a treaty (for example, the presumption in favor 12 Licensing Marijuana Cultivation c.\nIn addition to taking \u201cphysical possession,\u201d Article 23(2)(d) requires\nthat the national agency \u201cpurchase\u201d the marijuana from the cultivator.

Neither NIDA nor DEA \u201cpurchases\u201d the harvested crops from the\nNational Center, but it could be said that NIDA does not need to do so if\nit already has title to the marijuana. See State Mem. at 4\u20135; HHS Mem.\nat 5\u20136. Although the contract between NIDA and the National Center\nincludes some provisions discussing government property, they do not\nexpressly address or otherwise make clear where title to the marijuana\ncrops lies.9 But we need not decide whether NIDA has title to the crops. The requirement that the federal government physically possess the marijuana crops is distinct from the requirement that it \u201cpurchase\u201d the crops\nand thus secure title. See Single Convention art. 23(d). Physical possession is not conferred by mere \u201ctransfer of title or risk of loss.\u201d In re World\nImports, Ltd., 862 F.3d 338, 344 (3d Cir. 2017) (interpreting the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s reference to \u201creceipt of goods\u201d as requiring \u201cphysical\nof equitable tolling of federal statutes of limitations).

That clause\nstates that \u201c[t]itle to property (and other tangible personal property) purchased with funds\navailable for research and having a unit acquisition cost of less than $5,000 shall vest in\nthe Contractor upon acquisition or as soon thereafter as feasible; provided that the Contractor obtained the Contracting Officer\u2019s approval before each acquisition .\u201d 48 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 52.245-1 Alternate II (2012). If the unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more, title vests\n\u201cas set forth in this contract.\u201d Id.

Moreover, DEA certainly does not have title to the crops. Even if NIDA had formal legal title to the crops, the current arrangement\nwould still have to be adjusted to comply with the treaty\u2019s requirements\nthat a single government agency be charged with licensing cultivators,\npurchasing, and physically possessing the crops. In the course of making\nthose adjustments, DEA could enter into a contract that expressly states\nthat it owns the marijuana crops, should the agency seek to obviate the\nneed for a purchase and claim ownership in the marijuana from its inception, rather than buying back the crops shortly after the harvest.",

DEA has authority to control the lawful distribution of\nthe crops in certain respects. But just as with the physical possession\nrequirement, the Single Convention contemplates that the government\nmonopoly will involve more than the exercise of regulatory authority. The\nCommentary on the Convention stresses that wholesale trade \u201cmust be\nundertaken by governmental authorities,\u201d rather than private parties,\nbecause of the risk of diversion. Commentary at 278. The Convention\ncontemplates an actual \u201cmonopoly,\u201d id. at 284, i.e., \u201c[t]he market condition existing when only one economic entity produces a particular product\nor provides a particular service.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1160 (10th ed.\n2014). The government agency responsible for the relevant controls must\nown the crops and be the sole distributor of the marijuana. In allowing the\nNational Center to maintain possession of the marijuana and ship it to\nDEA-approved researchers, the NIDA contract does not create the required government monopoly over the lawful marijuana trade. 10\n10 The government monopoly need not extend to \u201cmedicinal\u201d marijuana. Single Convention art. 23(e). But that exception is not available under current federal law. As noted\nabove, the federal government has not recognized any accepted medical use for marijuana. See Oakland Cannabis Buyers\u2019 Co-op., 532 U.S. at 491. As a result, \u201cthere is currently no such thing in the United States as \u2018medicinal cannabis\u2019\u201d for purposes of the Single\nConvention. Lyle E. Craker, 74 Fed. Reg. at 2116. Moreover, anyone who wished to\nproduce medicinal marijuana or marijuana preparations would still be required to pur- 14 Licensing Marijuana Cultivation For the reasons discussed above, the National Center does not play the\nrole of the government monopolist. See supra Part II. A.2.b. Indeed, that\nconclusion is buttressed here by a constitutional concern. If the National\nCenter were viewed as exercising significant authority in establishing a\nfederal government monopoly over the lawful distribution of marijuana,\nin conformity with the international obligations of the United States, its\nofficials might be viewed as officers of the United States, who would\nneed to be appointed consistent with the Appointments Clause.

We are not aware that any National Center officials are so appointed, but because, as discussed above, we do not believe\nthat the National Center is exercising the sovereign authority of the United States, such concerns do not arise. B.\nEven if the current framework departs from Article 23, it would still\ncomply with the Convention if it satisfied Article 39, which provides that,\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding anything contained in this Convention, a Party shall\nnot be, or be deemed to be, precluded from adopting measures of control\nmore strict or severe than those provided by this Convention.\u201d We therefore must consider whether the NIDA contract system may be viewed as\nresulting in a \u201cmore strict or severe\u201d system of controls than one where\nthe government physically possesses the marijuana crops and monopolizes their distribution. See State Mem. at 4\u20136.\nArticle 39 permits a party to the Single Convention to impose substitute\nmeasures that result in tighter controls than those otherwise required. See\nCommentary at 449. But as the Commentary explains, such \u201csubstitute\nmeasures should clearly be \u2018more strict or severe\u2019 to prevent any . . .\ndoubts\u201d about their validity. Id. (emphasis added).

The close regulation of the National Center is not clearly more strict or\nsevere than the controls in Articles 23 and 28. The Office of the Legal\nAdviser points out that the NIDA contract, unlike the controls required by\nArticle 23(2), addresses the risk of diversion during the cultivation process in addition to diversion that may occur after the crops are harvested. See State Mem. at 5; State Supp. Mem. at 1.11 For example, the National\nCenter must maintain its registration for working with scheduled drugs,\n2015 NIDA Contract at 13, which requires certain security measures for\nmanufacturing activities, see, e.g., 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1301.73(b) (\u201cManufacturing activities with controlled substances shall be conducted in an area or\nareas of clearly defined limited access which is under surveillance by an\nemployee or employees designated in writing as responsible for the area.\u201d). As effective as those contractually imposed diversion controls may be\nduring marijuana cultivation, however, we cannot say that they clearly\ncompensate for the absence of the required controls governing the trade in\nthe crops, which the treaty drafters evidently believed posed greater risks\nof diversion. The controls required by Article 23 of the Single Convention\nreflect the specific concern that \u201cexperience has shown that permitting\nlicensed private traders to purchase the crops results in diversion of large\nquantities of drugs into illicit channels.\u201d Commentary at 278.",

The INCB\u2019s mandate\ndoes not require it to note every instance of noncompliance. Rather, the\nINCB is charged with identifying situations in which the Convention\u2019s\naims \u201care being seriously endangered by reason of the failure of any\nParty, country or territory to carry out [its] provisions.\u201d Single Convention art. 14(1)(a).

But the fact that the INCB has not objected to the federal licensing\nscheme does not mean that the INCB views that framework as complying\nwith the Single Convention. Indeed, the INCB\u2019s interpretation of the Single Convention appears entirely consistent with ours. For instance, the INCB\u2019s 2014 annual report\nadvises that \u201cStates wishing to establish programmes for the use of cannabis for medical purposes that are consistent with the requirements of the\nSingle Convention must establish a national cannabis agency to control,\nsupervise and license the cultivation of cannabis crops.\u201d Id. at 35.

Commentary at 313 n.9. 22 Licensing Marijuana Cultivation at 1\u20132 n.1 (quoting Article 36 of draft Single Convention). In other words,\nthe Single Convention\u2019s drafters considered, but rejected, allowing licensed private institutions to produce, store, and ship marijuana under\nclose government supervision, and instead adopted a requirement that the\ngovernment take physical possession of the crop and conduct trade in the\ndrug. That history also shows that the drafters of the Single Convention\nconsidered applying less-stringent controls to marijuana, but declined to\ndo so and instead applied the same stringent controls to marijuana, opium,\nand the coca leaf. III. For similar reasons, DEA\u2019s 2016 policy statement also fails to establish\na framework that would fully comply with Articles 23 and 28 of the\nSingle Convention. Under that policy, DEA would allow a licensee \u201cto operate independently\u201d of NIDA, \u201cprovided the grower agrees (through a written memorandum of agreement with DEA) that it will only distribute marijuana with\nprior, written approval from DEA.\u201d Applications To Manufacture Marijuana, 81 Fed.

Such a licensee would also \u201cbe subject to\nall applicable requirements of the CSA and DEA regulations, including\nthose relating to quotas, record keeping, order forms, security, and diversion control.\u201d Id. DEA suggests that these requirements would be consistent with the purposes of Articles 23 and 28 of the Single Convention\nbecause these requirements \u201cwill succeed in avoiding one of the scenarios\nthe treaty is designed to prevent: Private parties trading in marijuana\noutside the supervision or direction of the federal government.\u201d Id. While DEA focuses on its view of the broader purposes of the treaty\u2019s\nrequirements, the Single Convention requires the United States to adopt\nspecific, listed controls if it licenses cannabis cultivation. A single government agency must purchase and take physical possession of harvested\ncannabis, and generally monopolize the wholesale trade in that plant. The\nUnited States cannot satisfy those requirements simply by employing\nalternatives that the government believes may prevent unlawful diversion. As we have explained, Articles 23 and 28 certainly could have given the\nparties the discretion to determine the particular controls necessary. Rather than take that route, the parties to the treaty agreed to certain\nspecific controls, and Congress has required the Attorney General to\napply those strictures when granting licenses under the CSA. Accord23 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 42 ingly, DEA\u2019s licensing procedures must comply with those choices. DEA\u2019s announced policy, however, would not comply with Articles 23\nand 28 of the Single Convention. IV. We conclude that DEA must alter the marijuana licensing framework to\ncomply with the Single Convention. DEA has discretion to develop a\nregulatory framework that meets the requirements of Articles 23 and 28. In doing so, DEA need not rule out a regime in which DEA purchases or\ntakes legal title to the marijuana plants prior to their cultivation; adopts a\nsystem of regulation and day-to-day supervision that would create an\nagency relationship; or relies upon NIDA\u2019s expertise to assist the agency\nin its functions.",

At a minimum, however, this licensing framework must\nprovide for a system in which DEA or its legal agent has physical possession and ownership over the cultivated marijuana and assumes control of\nthe distribution of marijuana no later than four months after harvesting. In justifying the current licensing framework, DEA had concluded that\nthe division of labor with NIDA was \u201ca result of the existing statutes,\nregulations, and Congressional appropriations,\u201d and declined to opine on\nwhether, absent legislation, DEA could carry out all the functions required by the Single Convention. Lyle E. Craker, PhD, 76 Fed. Reg. at\n51,409\u201310. Having examined DEA\u2019s and NIDA\u2019s authorities, we do not\nbelieve that further legislation is required for DEA to perform those\nfunctions. DEA has statutory authority to do so pursuant to 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 823(a), which obliges DEA (by delegation from the Attorney General)\nto ensure that registrations for the manufacture of marijuana comply with\nthe Single Convention. That language authorizes DEA to take steps reasonably necessary to ensure that the registration scheme complies with the\nSingle Convention, which as we have said clearly contemplates that a\nsingle government agency will purchase and take physical possession of\nmarijuana crops from registrants. The statute thus authorizes DEA to\nperform the control functions contemplated by the Single Convention,\nincluding the functions of purchasing (or otherwise securing title over)\nand taking physical possession of marijuana crops. Reading the statute\notherwise would preclude DEA from registering any marijuana manufacturer because no registration could be in compliance with the Single\nConvention, contrary to Congress\u2019s evident intent that DEA administer\nthe registration system. Congress has also established a fund for DEA\u2019s\n24 Licensing Marijuana Cultivation diversion control program, which includes DEA activities \u201crelated to the\nregistration and control of the manufacture, distribution, [and] dispensing\n. . . of controlled substances.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 886a(2)(B) (emphasis added). Because Congress has made compliance with the Single Convention a\nnecessary condition of registration, id. \u00a7 823(a), that fund may be used in\npurchasing, storing, and monopolizing the wholesale trade in marijuana. And although HHS has statutory authority to \u201cdetermine the qualifications\nand competency\u201d of the researchers who seek to purchase marijuana from\nlicensed growers to conduct research, id. \u00a7 823(f ), that provision would\nnot bar DEA from establishing a government monopoly from which those\nresearchers could purchase marijuana.

The Single Convention does not\nrequire that a single government agency be charged with all responsibilities related to marijuana, and the congressional decision to delegate those\nresponsibilities to HHS is consistent with the Single Convention. Aside\nfrom carrying out its role under section 823(f ), NIDA may continue to\nexercise some supervision over certain aspects of the marijuana cultivation, and DEA may consult NIDA in the process. We see no reason why\nthe NIDA contract framework might not remain in place under a system\nin which DEA assumes clear title to the marijuana, either at inception or\nby purchase after harvest, and then takes physical possession after harvest. For instance, DEA could station one or more employees at the National Center after cultivation as a way of ensuring physical possession of\nthe marijuana and exclusive control over its distribution. We would be pleased to advise on these or any other matters concerning implementation of a new licensing framework. HENRY C. WHITAKER\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel\n25",
