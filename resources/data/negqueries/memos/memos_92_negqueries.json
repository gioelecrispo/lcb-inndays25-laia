I. BACKGROUND The Federal Housing Finance Board (\u201cFHFB\u201d) was established by\nthe Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989\n(\u201cFIRREA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 101-73, \u00a7 702(a), 103 Stat. 183, 413 (codified at\n12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1422a(a)), for the purpose of overseeing and regulating the\nFederal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board (\u201cFHLBB\u201d)\nhad previously supervised the Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLBB also\nexercised regulatory supervision over federally insured savings and loan as\u00ad\nsociations. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1437, 1464-1470, & 1724-1730i (1988). FIRREA abolished the FHLBB and distributed its duties among several agen\u00ad\ncies. The Office of Thrift Supervision (\u201cOTS\u201d) was assigned prim ary\nregulatory authority over the savings and loan industry, see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1462a(e), as added by FIRREA, \u00a7 301, 103 Stat. at 278-79, and the FHFB\nwas given regulatory authority over the Federal Home Loan Banks. See 12\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1422a & 1422b, as added by FIRREA, \u00a7 702(a), 103 Stat. at 41314. Other functions previously performed by the FHLBB relating to the\nmanagement of deposit insurance and the resolution of cases were transferred\n127 respectively to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) and the\nResolution Trust Corporation (\u201cRTC\u201d). FIRREA, \u00a7\u00a7 202 & 501(a), 103\nStat. at 188, 363-93, (codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1811 & 1441a). The FHFB is to be managed by a Board of Directors comprising five\nmembers: the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and four indi\u00ad\nviduals appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1422a(b)(l).\u2018",

At least one of these four directors must be\nchosen \u201cfrom an organization with more than a 2-year history of represent\u00ad\ning consum er or community interests on banking services, credit needs,\nhousing, or financial consumer protections.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1422a(b)(2)(B). These\nfour directors may not hold any other appointed office or serve as an officer\nor director of a Federal Home Loan Bank or of any member of any such\nBank, nor may they have any financial interest in any such member. Id. \u00a7\n1422a(b)(2)(A) & (C). II. DISCUSSION No provision o f FIRREA expressly or impliedly requires that the mem\u00ad\nbers o f the Board of Directors of the FHFB serve on either a full-time or a\npart-tim e basis. Accordingly, the employment status of the members must\nbe determined by construing the relevant provision of FIRREA, as a whole,\nin light of the Act\u2019s legislative history. 2 There is little legislative history on this question. From the legislative\nhistory that does exist, however, it appears that Congress contemplated that\nmembers of the Board of Directors would serve on a part-time basis. The\nconference report and the Senate report on the bill that became law are\nsilent on the part-time or full-time status of the members of Board of Direc\u00ad\ntors. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 222, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 423-24 (1989),\nreprinted in 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 432, 462-63; S. Rep.

However, the House report on the bill reported by the House\nBanking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee does address this issue, and\nthere is no relevant difference between the applicable provisions in that bill\nand those contained in the bill that was enacted into law. 3 The House report\nunequivocally states that \u201cmembers of the Board of Directors will not serve\non a full-time basis.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 54(1), 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 455 (1989),\nreprinted in 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 86, 251. An analysis of the provisions of FIRREA that created the FHFB and\ndefined its duties supports the conclusion that Congress expected that mem\u00ad\nbers of the FHFB Board of Directors may serve on a part-time basis. Although\nthe members of the FHLBB served on a full-time basis, FIRREA divided the\nduties of the FHLBB among at least four different agencies and assigned the\nfive members of the FHFB substantially fewer functions than had been per\u00ad\nformed by the three members of the FHLBB.",

In particular, the burdensome\ntasks of supervising thrift institutions and of managing case resolutions were\nassigned to OTS and RTC respectively, not to the FHFB. Also, oversight of\ndeposit insurance was transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpora\u00ad\ntion. The House report thus described the FHFB as \u201ca small, effective and\nefficient governing body.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 54(1), at 455, 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N.\nat 251. In light of the fact that the FHFB is to perform substantially fewer\ntasks with a greater number of members, it was fully reasonable for Con\u00ad\ngress to conclude that full-time service would not be essential for members\nof the FHFB Board. We also note that FIRREA authorizes the FHFB to \u201cemploy, direct, and\nfix the compensation and number of employees, attorneys, and agents of the\nFederal Housing Finance Board.\u201d FIRREA, \u00a7 702(a), 103 Stat. at 414 (codi\u00ad\nfied at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1422b(b)(l)).

Accordingly, we conclude that the members of the Board of Directors may\nserve on a part-time basis. Indeed, the only available direct evidence is that\nCongress expected that the Directors would serve part-time.

Indeed, the only available direct evidence is that\nCongress expected that the Directors would serve part-time. We do not believe that any of the provisions of FIRREA are inconsistent\nwith this conclusion. In particular, the fact that FIRREA provides for the\nChairperson and other members of the Board of Directors to be compen\u00ad\nsated respectively at Levels III and IV of the Executive Schedule, see FIRREA,\n\u00a7 702(a), 103 Stat. at 415 (codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1422b(b)(l)), does not\nimply that these individuals must serve in a full-time capacity. This provi\u00ad\nsion merely fixes the rate of compensation. Federal law provides the formula\nfor calculating the salary of a part-time employee from the Executive Sched\u00ad\nule if the annual rate of compensation is known. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5505. M oreover, the original House bill established the same rates of compensa\u00ad\ntion for these officials, see H.R. 1278, \u00a7 723, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (as\nreported by the House Comm, on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs),\nreprinted in H.R. Rep. No. 54(1), at 190, at the same time that the House\nreport expressly acknowledged that these individuals would not serve full\u00ad\ntime. Id. at 455, 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 251. Finally, we do not believe that the fact that FIRREA contains conflict-ofinterest and incompatibility provisions applicable to the FHFB implies that\nthe members o f the Board o f Directors must serve on a full-time basis. Section 702 of FIRREA provides that each of the appointed members of the\nBoard of Directors of the FHFB may not \u201chold any other appointed office\nduring his or her term as director\u201d and may not \u201cserve as a director or\nofficer o f any Federal Home Loan Bank or any member of any Bank\u201d or\n\u201chold shares of, or any other financial interest, in, any member of any such\nBank.\u201d 103 Stat. at 413 (codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1422a(b)(2)(A) & (C)). These provisions serve purposes that are wholly independent of the employ\u00ad\nment status of the Board of Directors and do not in any way suggest that\nCongress intended for these members to serve on a full-time basis. The\npurpose o f the conflict-of-interest provisions is to ensure the impartiality\nand objectivity o f the members of the Board. The incompatibility provision\nensures the FHFB\u2019s status as an \u201cindependent agency in the executive branch,\u201d\n12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1422a(a)(2), by forbidding the simultaneous appointment of, for\nexample, a Treasury Department official to the Board of Directors of the\nFHFB.5 The need for such restrictions exists regardless of whether the mem\u00ad\nbers serve full-time or part-time.
