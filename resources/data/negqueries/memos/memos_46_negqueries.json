February 6, 1945 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL* The State Department has requested the informal advice of the Attorney General on a question that has arisen in connection with the International Air Services\nTransit Agreement, commonly called the \u201cTwo Freedoms Agreement,\u201d and the\nInternational Air Transport Agreement, frequently referred to as the \u201cFive\nFreedoms Agreement,\u201d drawn up at the International Civil Aviation Conference\nheld in Chicago in the fall of 1944. These agreements grant to the signatory\npowers certain privileges with respect to \u201cscheduled international air services.\u201d It\nis in connection with these privileges that the following question has risen: Assuming that reciprocal rights have been granted by some valid arrangement\nbetween the United States and a foreign country, is the Civil Aeronautics Authority authorized under existing law to grant to aircraft of the foreign country a license\nor certificate (1) to fly across United States territory without landing; and (2) to\nland in the United States for non-traffic purposes (e.g., refueling)? The State Department has not asked this Department to examine the details of\nthese agreements, or to comment on the Convention on Civil Aviation or the\nInterim Agreement on Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago. The State Department\nhas not asked us to consider whether the agreements require ratification by the\nSenate or may be executed as executive agreements. The only question that has\nbeen put to us relates to the construction of the statutes regulating civil aviation\nand we shall confine the discussion in this memorandum to that point. The\nquestion of statutory construction, however, does have a bearing on the question\nwhether the agreements may properly be executed as executive agreements for the\nfollowing reason: If the agreements required or contemplated action by the Civil\nAeronautics Authority or any other agency of the government that was unauthor* Editor\u2019s Note: The cover memorandum attached to this memorandum opinion states that \u201cMr.\nAcheson [presumably Dean Acheson, then Assistant Secretary of State, later Secretary of State under\nPresident Truman] is very eager to get our views on this; he has called me twice in the past week. It\nmay be that you will wish to submit a copy of my memorandum to Mr. Acheson for his comments\nbefore you decide whether you agree with the conclusion reached in the memorandum.\u201d The cover\nmemorandum states further: \u201cThe State Department has not asked us for a formal opinion, and you will\nrecall that in his conference with us Mr. Acheson said he was not sure that the State Department would\nmake this request.\u201d 106 Implementation of International Civil Aviation Agreements ized or forbidden by domestic law, a serious question might arise as to whether the\nagreements could be consummated as executive agreements.",

      "content": "The section, however, authorizes the Civil Aeronautics Authority to\ngrant certain flight privileges to foreign aircraft. The only question discussed in\nthis memorandum is whether foreign aircraft may be authorized to make non-stop\nflights over the United States or to land for non-traffic purposes in the United\nStates. In neither case would the foreign aircraft be authorized to pick up passengers or freight at any point in the United States, its territories or possessions\ndestined for any other point in the United States, its territories or possessions. The first sentence of section 6(c) authorizes the Civil Aeronautics Authority to\npermit foreign aircraft \u201cto be navigated in the United States.\u201d In its ordinary\nmeaning and as defined in the act, \u201cnavigation\u201d includes any flight by aircraft\nwhether or not a landing is made; both non-stop flight and transit flight with the\nprivilege of landing for non-commercial purposes necessarily involve the navigation of aircraft in the airspace over the United States. Therefore, if the first\nsentence of section 6(c) stood alone, it would authorize the Civil Aeronautics\nAuthority to grant a permit for the type of flight discussed in this memorandum. It\nis necessary, however, to consider the limitation placed on this sentence by the\nsecond sentence of section 6(c). That sentence provides that foreign aircraft may not engage in \u201cair commerce\notherwise than between any State, Territory or possession of the United States\n(including the Philippine Islands) or the District of Columbia, and a foreign\ncountry.\u201d For the purpose of deciding how this sentence should be interpreted we\nshall first consider the meaning of the term \u201cair commerce\u201d and then discuss the\nrequirement that air commerce must be between a state, territory or possession of\nthe United States, or the District of Columbia, and a foreign country. As defined in section 1(3) of the Civil Aeronautics Act, the term \u201cair commerce\u201d includes any navigation of aircraft within the limits of a civil airway or any\nnavigation of aircraft which may endanger the safety of operations in air commerce. Under this definition any flight by aircraft into the airspace of the United\nStates would appear to be \u201cair commerce.\u201d Both non-stop flights and transit flights\nwith non-traffic landing privileges are, therefore, \u201cair commerce\u201d within this\ndefinition. 3 3\nIf section 6(c) is examined in the light of the definition of \u201cair commerce\u201d contained in the 1926\nstatute, it is none the less clear that under section 6(c) the Civil Aeronautics Authority may authorize\nnon-stop flight by foreign aircraft as part of a scheduled international air service. As defined in the\n1926 statute, \u201cair commerce\u201d includes the navigation of aircraft in the furtherance of a business. 49 109 Supplemental Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 1 If a foreign aircraft en route from one foreign point to another stops at some\npoint in the United States or one of its possessions for a non-traffic purpose, it\nseems clear that the aircraft is engaged in air commerce between a \u201cState,\nTerritory or possession of the United States (including the Philippine Islands) or\nthe District of Columbia, and a foreign country\u201d within the meaning of the statute.",

      "content": "There remains for consideration the question whether a non-stop flight by a\nforeign aircraft over American territory en route from a point in one foreign\ncountry to another foreign point also falls within the statutory language. When an\naircraft enters the airspace over any part of the United States, including its\nterritories and possessions, it has entered the United States as much as if it had\nlanded within the territorial boundaries, since the United States has sovereignty\nover the overlying airspace. Cf. United States v. One Pitcairn Bi-Plane, 11 F.\nSupp. 24 (W.D.N.Y. 1935). For the purpose of subsection (c) it does not appear to\nmake any difference whether the foreign aircraft returns by the same route it\nentered the United States. The section refers to \u201cany\u201d foreign country and does not\nrequire the aircraft to leave the United States by the same route it followed when\nentering. Section 6(c) of the Air Commerce Act does not prohibit a foreign aircraft from\nentering the airspace over more than one state, territory or possession of the\nUnited States. The section refers to \u201cany\u201d state, territory, or possession and does\nnot limit the application of the section to states which are on the boundary of the\nUnited States. In addition, subsection (c) refers to the District of Columbia. It\nwould not be possible for a foreign aircraft to fly into the airspace over the District\nof Columbia without crossing the airspace of some other state. It is obvious,\ntherefore, that the statute does not contemplate that the foreign aircraft is prohibited from entering any state other than a border state. This construction of section 6(c) is reinforced by a consideration of the purposes of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. Section 3 of that Act declares that the\npurpose of the statute is to promote the development of air transportation. If the\nstatute were construed to prohibit the Civil Aeronautics Authority from granting a\ncertificate to foreign aircraft for non-stop flight as part of a scheduled international\nair service, even though the foreign government was willing to grant reciprocal\nprivileges, the foreign government would undoubtedly refuse such privileges to\nAmerican air lines. As a result, the development of international air transport\nservices by American carriers would be hampered rather than encouraged. III. Administrative Construction\nAdministrative practice under both the Air Commerce Act of 1926 and the\nCivil Aeronautics Act of 1938 supports the construction of section 6(c) outlined in\nU.S.C. \u00a7 171. Non-stop flights or transit flights with the privileges of non-traffic landing carried on as a\npart of a regularly scheduled air service appear to be included within this definition of air commerce. 110 Implementation of International Civil Aviation Agreements this memorandum. Under the 1926 statute, a number of bilateral agreements\nrelating to air navigation were entered into between the United States and other\ncountries granting, among other things, reciprocal privileges of non-stop flight,\nsubject to various limitations not relevant here and to the rules and regulations of\neach country.",

IV. Legislative History The legislative history does not offer positive assurance with respect to the\nconstruction of section 6(c) of the Air Commerce Act. Non-stop flights by foreign\naircraft and transit flights with the privilege of landing for non-traffic purposes\nwere not the subject of debate in Congress at the time of the passage of the Civil\nAeronautics Act of 1938. However, the agreements executed under the Air\nCommerce Act were not criticized or repudiated by the Congress. The legislative\nhistory indicates in this respect that the Congress intended to make no substantial\nchange in section 6(c) of that Act. V. Conclusion It is my view that the Department of State may be advised informally that if a\nvalid reciprocal arrangement has been entered into between the United States and\na foreign country, the Civil Aeronautics Authority is authorized under existing law\nto grant to a foreign aircraft a permit to fly across the territory of the United States\nwithout landing or a permit to land for non-traffic purposes in the United States,\nsubject to compliance with the laws and regulations of the United States. 111 Supplemental Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 1 It is unnecessary to discuss in this memorandum whether a non-stop flight with\nor without the privilege of landing for technical reasons is the kind of air transportation for which a permit must be granted under section 401 or 402 of the Civil\nAeronautics Act of 1938. Cf. Canadian Colonial Airways, Inc.\u2014Investigation,\n2 C.A.B. 752, Docket No. 601 (July 7, 1941).

COX\nAssistant Solicitor General 112 Implementation of International Civil Aviation Agreements\nJanuary 29, 1945 MEMORANDUM FOR THE ASSISTANT SOLICITOR GENERAL This memorandum is in response to your request for my views on the questions\npresented in the memorandum from the Department of State for the Attorney\nGeneral, dated January 8, 1945. I.\nAt the International Civil Aviation Conference held at Chicago, there were\ndrawn up on December 7, 1944, the following multilateral agreements:\n(1) a Convention on International Civil Aviation;\n(2) an Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation;\n(3) an International Air Services Transit Agreement; and\n(4) an International Air Transport Agreement. Members of the Civil Aeronautics Board attended the conference as delegates\nof the United States. It is understood that they have approved the agreements. The Convention is to be submitted to the Senate for ratification. The Interim\nAgreement provides for the establishment of a provisional organization for\ncollaboration in the field of international civil aviation. It is to last only until the\nConvention comes into operation, or at most for a period of three years. We are concerned only with the third and the fourth of these four agreements,\nthe International Air Services Transit Agreement and the International Air\nTransport Agreement. These agreements deal with \u201cscheduled international air\nservices.\u201d The International Air Services Transit Agreement, commonly referred to as the\nTwo Freedoms Agreement, provides in pertinent part:\nARTICLE I\nSection 1\nEach contracting State grants to the other contracting States the following freedoms of the air in respect of scheduled international air\nservices:\n(1) The privilege to fly across its territory without landing;\n(2) The privilege to land for non-traffic purposes. . . . 113 Supplemental Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 1 Section 4\nEach contracting State may, subject to the provisions of this Agreement,\n(1) Designate the route to be followed within its territory by any international air service and the airports which any such service may\nuse . . . . Section 5 Each contracting State reserves the right to withhold or revoke a certificate or permit to an air transport enterprise of another State in any\ncase where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective\ncontrol are vested in nationals of a contracting State, or in case of\nfailure of such air transport enterprise to comply with the laws of the\nState over which it operates, or to perform its obligations under this\nAgreement. The second agreement, document 4 above mentioned, is the International Air\nTransport Agreement, commonly referred to as the Five Freedoms Agreement. It\ncontains the same provisions as those quoted above from the International Air\nServices Transit Agreement (article I, sections 1, 5 and 6) and, in addition, three\nother privileges, hence giving rise to the name Five Freedoms Agreement. Each of these two agreements comes into force as between contracting States\nupon its acceptance by each of them.",

It is my understanding that\nwith respect to the present inquiry this department is not concerned with any\nquestion arising out of the relation of the provisions of the Two Freedoms\nAgreement and of the Five Freedoms Agreement to the provisions of the Interim\nAgreement and the Convention; or with any question of national defense or\nsecurity; or with the fact that the two agreements are multilateral international\nagreements, and not bilateral agreements; or with any question as to whether the\nTwo Freedoms Agreement and the Five Freedoms Agreement may be executed by\nthe President as executive agreements without the necessity of submitting the\nagreements, or either of them, to the Senate for its advice and consent as to\nratification. 114 Implementation of International Civil Aviation Agreements The only question on which the Department of State desires the informal opinion of the Attorney General is the question whether the two privileges granted by\nthe Two Freedoms Agreement and the Five Freedoms Agreement with respect to\nforeign scheduled air services, (1) to fly across the territory of the United States\nwithout landing, and (2) to land in the United States for non-traffic purposes, are\nauthorized by, or conform with, existing law of the United States. This question\nwill be considered on the basis that the agreements conferring these privileges are\nbilateral agreements. II. Both the Paris Convention of 1919 (Convention for the Regulation of Aerial\nNavigation, Oct. 13, 1919, 11 L.N.T.S. 173) and the Havana Convention of 1928\n(Pan American Convention on Commercial Aviation, U.S.-Cuba, Feb. 20, 1928,\n47 Stat. 1901) adopted the doctrine of complete and exclusive sovereignty over the\nair space above the territory of a state, but contained provisions extending certain\nreciprocal privileges to foreign aircraft within the territories of member states. This principle of exclusive sovereignty over the air space, but with authorization for innocent passage of civil foreign aircraft under certain conditions, is\nwritten into the statutes of the United States to which reference will shortly be\nmade. The Paris Convention was signed by the United States, but it was not ratified. S. Doc. No. 67-348, at 3768 (1923). Ratification of the Havana Convention was\nadvised by the Senate on February 20, 1931. 74 Cong. Rec. 5514. The Convention\nwas ratified by the President on March 6, 1931, and proclaimed by the President\non July 27, 1931. 47 Stat. 1901.",

The Convention\nwas ratified by the President on March 6, 1931, and proclaimed by the President\non July 27, 1931. 47 Stat. 1901. Incidentally, it may be noted that Article XV of the Paris Convention provides\nthat every aircraft of a contracting State has the right to cross the air space of\nanother State without landing, subject to following a designated route. S. Doc.\nNo. 67-348, at 3775. The Paris Convention and the Havana Convention have been interpreted to\ndeny freedom of air navigation to the operators of air lines, except by special\nagreement. As a result, international services have been established pursuant to\ninternational bilateral agreements and, in some cases, by unilateral concession. The United States is a party to a number of bilateral agreements under which each\nparty grants certain privileges to the civil aircraft of the other party. Air navigation in the United States is regulated by the provisions of the Civil\nAeronautics Act of 1938, and the Air Commerce Act of 1926 as amended by the\nCivil Aeronautics Act of 1938. I shall discuss first the Air Commerce Act of 1926\nas originally enacted, and, secondly, the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. Section 6 of the Air Commerce Act of 1926, as originally enacted, provides: 115 Supplemental Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 1 (a) The Congress hereby declares that the Government of the United\nStates has, to the exclusion of all foreign nations, complete sovereignty of the airspace over the lands and waters of the United States,\nincluding the Canal Zone. Aircraft a part of the armed forces of any\nforeign nation shall not be navigated in the United States, including\nthe Canal Zone, except in accordance with an authorization granted\nby the Secretary of State. (b) Foreign aircraft not a part of the armed forces of the foreign nation shall be navigated in the United States only if authorized as\nhereinafter in this section provided; and if so authorized, such aircraft and airmen serving in connection therewith, shall be subject to\nthe requirements of section 3, unless exempt under subdivision (c) of\nthis section. (c) If a foreign nation grants a similar privilege in respect of aircraft\nof the United States, and/or airmen serving in connection therewith,\nthe Secretary of Commerce may authorize aircraft registered under\nthe law of the foreign nation and not a part of the armed forces\nthereof to be navigated in the United States, and may by regulation\nexempt such aircraft, and/or airmen serving in connection therewith,\nfrom the requirements of section 3, other than the air traffic rules;\nbut no foreign aircraft shall engage in interstate or intrastate commerce.

The parts underscored in the above quotation were repealed or amended by the\nCivil Aeronautics Act of 1938, Pub. L. No. 75-706, 52 Stat. 973.\nSection 9(b) of the Air Commerce Act of 1926 provides that the term \u201cUnited\nStates,\u201d when used in a geographical sense, means the territory comprising the\nseveral States, Territories, possessions, and the District of Columbia, and the\noverlying air space. 44 Stat. at 573. The term \u201cair commerce\u201d is defined in section 1 of the statute as \u201ctransportation in whole or in part by aircraft of persons or property for hire, navigation of\naircraft in furtherance of a business, or navigation of aircraft from one place to\nanother for operation in the conduct of a business.\u201d 44 Stat. at 568. The term \u201cinterstate or foreign air commerce\u201d is defined in section 1 of the\nstatute to mean \u201cair commerce between any State, Territory, or possession, or the\nDistrict of Columbia, and any place outside thereof; or between points within the\nsame State, Territory, or possession, or the District of Columbia, but through the\nairspace of any place outside thereof; or wholly within the airspace over any\nTerritory or possession or the District of Columbia.\u201d 44 Stat. at 568. 116 Implementation of International Civil Aviation Agreements It will be seen that section 6 of the statute permits foreign civil aircraft, not a\npart of the armed forces of a foreign nation, to be \u201cnavigated in the United States\u201d\nunder certain conditions. The conditions are:\n(1) Reciprocal rights must first be granted by the foreign nation with\nrespect to aircraft of the United States. The foreign aircraft or carrier\u2014\n(2) must receive authorization from the Secretary of Commerce to be\n\u201cnavigate[d] in the United States\u201d;\n(3) may be subject to regulation; and\n(4) may not engage in interstate or intrastate air commerce. 44 Stat. at 572. Subject to the foregoing conditions, foreign civil aircraft may be \u201cnavigated in\nthe United States.\u201d This term is not defined in the statute. Also, it is to be noted\nthat the statute contains no express reference to non-stop flights or landing for\nnon-traffic purposes. It seems clear that so long as a foreign aircraft does not\nengage in interstate or intrastate air commerce, both non-stop flights and landing\nfor non-traffic purposes would fall within the terms \u201cnavigated in the United\nStates\u201d and \u201cair commerce\u201d as used in the Air Commerce Act of 1926. The term \u201cnavigation in the United States\u201d as used in the statute includes any\nnavigation through the air space over the territory of the United States or any part\nthereof. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 2(e), 5(e); 44 Stat. at 569, 571. This term would, therefore, include\na non-stop flight across the territory of the United States and a stop or stops in the\nUnited States for non-traffic purposes. The term \u201cair commerce\u201d is defined in the Act of 1926 to include \u201ctransportation in whole or in part by aircraft of persons or property for hire\u201d and \u201cnavigation\nof aircraft in furtherance of a business.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1; 44 Stat. at 568.",

Navigation of a\nforeign aircraft on a non-stop flight across the United States or a part thereof\nwould seem to fall within both of these definitions. Likewise, the landing of a foreign aircraft in the United States for non-traffic\npurposes\u2014refueling, for example\u2014when done in connection with transportation\nby the aircraft of persons or property for hire, or in connection with navigation of\nthe aircraft in furtherance of a business, seems clearly to fall within the meaning of\nthe term \u201cair commerce\u201d as used in the statute. I find no apparent intent either in the language of the original Air Commerce\nAct of 1926 or its history to limit foreign aircraft to engaging in \u201cforeign air\ncommerce\u201d within any restricted definition of this term that would exclude nonstop flights. On the contrary, the foregoing analysis of the provisions of the statute\nshows that non-stop flights of foreign civil aircraft and landing of civil aircraft for 117 Supplemental Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 1 non-traffic purposes are within the terms of the authorization contained in the\nstatute as originally enacted. There seems, however, to have been some doubt as to the construction of the\nAir Commerce Act of 1926. Thus, in March 1938, Mr. Hester, Assistant General\nCounsel, Treasury Department, later Administrator of Civil Aeronautics, gave the\nfollowing testimony before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Interstate\nand Foreign Commerce: While the authority of the Secretary of Commerce under that act [the\nAir Commerce Act of 1926] to permit the operation of foreign private aircraft in this country is clear, his authority to permit the operation of a foreign air carrier to this country is in doubt. Consequently,\na provision has been inserted in the present bill providing that no\nforeign air carrier shall operate to the United States unless it secures\nfrom the Authority a permit to do so. The issuance of such permits\nwould be subject to the approval of the President. Hearings on H.R. 9738 Before the H. Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. at 41 (1938). The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 created a Civil Aeronautics Authority and\nconferred certain powers and duties upon an Administrator. Pub. L. No. 75-706,\n\u00a7 201, 52 Stat. at 980-81. The title, Civil Aeronautics Authority, was changed to\nCivil Aeronautics Board by the provisions of the President\u2019s Reorganization Plan\n4 of 1940, \u00a7 7, 5 Fed.

The statute gives recognition to \u201cagreements\u201d entered into by the United States\nwith foreign governments \u201cfor the establishment or development of air navigation,\nincluding air routes and services.\u201d It will be noted that under the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 a foreign air carrier is required to obtain from the Civil Aeronautics Board a permit to engage in\nforeign air transportation. The issuance of any permit is subject to the approval of 119 Supplemental Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 1 the President. It is understood that if the Two Freedoms Agreement and the Five\nFreedoms Agreement are entered into by the United States, foreign air carriers\nwho wish to make non-stop flights or who want permission to land in the United\nStates for non-traffic purposes will be required to obtain permits from the Civil\nAeronautics Board in the same manner as other foreign air carriers who make\nstops in the United States for traffic purposes. The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 (section 1107(i)(1) and (5)) amended section 6(c) of the Air Commerce Act of 1926 to read in part as follows: If a foreign nation grants a similar privilege in respect of aircraft of\nthe United States, and/or airmen serving in connection therewith, the\nCivil Aeronautics Authority may authorize aircraft registered under\nthe law of the foreign nation and not a part of the armed forces\nthereof to be navigated in the United States.

Section 1 of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 contains the following definitions:\n(3) \u201cAir Commerce\u201d means interstate, overseas, or foreign air commerce or the transportation of mail by aircraft or any operation or\nnavigation of aircraft within the limits of any civil airway or any operation or navigation of aircraft which directly affects, or which may\nendanger safety in, interstate, overseas, or foreign air commerce. 120 Implementation of International Civil Aviation Agreements ....\n(20) \u201cInterstate air commerce,\u201d \u201coverseas air commerce\u201d, and \u201cforeign air commerce,\u201d respectively, mean the carriage by aircraft of\npersons or property for compensation or hire, or the carriage of mail\nby aircraft, or the operation or navigation of aircraft in the conduct or\nfurtherance of a business or vocation, in commerce between, respectively\u2014\n(a) a place in any State of the United States, or the District of Columbia, and a place in any other State of the United States, or the\nDistrict of Columbia; or between places in the same State of the\nUnited States through the air space over any place outside thereof; or between places in the same Territory or possession (except\nthe Philippine Islands) of the United States, or the District of Columbia;\n(b) a place in any State of the United States, or the District of Columbia, and any place in a Territory or possession of the United\nStates; or between a place in a Territory or possession of the\nUnited States, and a place in any other Territory or possession of\nthe United States; and\n(c) a place in the United States and any place outside thereof,\nwhether such commerce moves wholly by aircraft or partly by\naircraft and partly by other forms of transportation. Under section 6 of the Air Commerce Act of 1926, as amended, foreign aircraft\nmay be authorized \u201cto be navigated in the United States.\u201d It has been shown that\nthis term includes non-stop flights. Section 6 further provides that no foreign\naircraft shall engage in \u201cair commerce\u201d otherwise than between any State,\nTerritory or possession of the United States and a foreign country. The term \u201cair\ncommerce\u201d as used in section 6 before it was amended by the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 also includes non-stop flights. The term \u201cair commerce\u201d in the last sentence of section 6(c) of the 1926 Act,\nafter the subsection was amended by the 1938 Act, is somewhat ambiguous for the\nreason that the definition of \u201cair commerce\u201d in the Act of 1938 differs from the\ndefinition of \u201cair commerce\u201d in the Act of 1926. The term \u201cair commerce\u201d as used\nin the 1938 Act includes any operation or navigation of aircraft which directly\naffects, or which may endanger safety in, interstate, overseas, or foreign air\ncommerce. This definition, therefore, as well as the definition of \u201cair commerce\u201d\nin the 1926 Act, seems to include non-stop flights.

The conferees adopted the House amendment, dealing with\n\u201cadmission of foreign aircraft into the United States,\u201d without, however, indicating\nthat in their opinion there was any material difference between the Senate\nprovision and the House provision. Where there was any substantial or material\ndifference between a Senate provision and a House provision, the conference\nreport called attention to the difference. See H.R. Rep. No. 75-2635, at 80\u201381\n(1938). It thus appears that the provisions of the House bill and the Senate bill were\neach designed to prohibit foreign aircraft from engaging in interstate air commerce\nor overseas air commerce or air commerce wholly within a State. The amendment\nto the 1926 Act made by the 1938 Act authorizing foreign aircraft to engage in air\ncommerce between the United States and foreign countries discloses no purpose to\nprohibit foreign air carriers from engaging in air commerce to the extent of\nmaking non-stop flights across territory of the United States or of landing in the\nUnited States for non-traffic purposes. The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 is intended to promote the development of\ncivil aeronautics and air commerce in the United States and abroad. The statute\nshould be construed consistently with this purpose and its provisions.

In permitting\nforeign aircraft to engage in air commerce between the United States and a foreign 122 Implementation of International Civil Aviation Agreements country the Congress has disclosed no purpose to prohibit foreign aircraft from\nmaking commercial non-stop flights over the territory of the United States. Fairly\nconstrued, such non-stop flights of foreign aircraft fall within the provisions of the\nAir Commerce Act of 1926, as amended, and the provisions of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. A construction that would prohibit foreign aircraft from engaging in commercial non-stop flights undoubtedly would preclude the Government of the United\nStates from obtaining similar privileges from foreign governments for American\nair carriers. Such a construction would hamper and restrict the development of\ncivil aeronautics and air commerce in the United States. It would be contrary to\nthe provisions and purpose of the Air Commerce Act of 1926, as amended, and the\nCivil Aeronautics Act of 1938. III. The administrative practice supports the construction that I have suggested. Under the 1926 Act a number of bilateral agreements were entered into by the\nUnited States with foreign governments granting liberty of passage over our\nterritory in time of peace, and providing for the establishment and operation of\nregular air routes by air transport companies \u201cacross the said territory, with or\nwithout intermediary landing, . . . subject to prior consent of the other party given\non the principle of reciprocity.\u201d Air Navigation Agreement, U.S.-Swe., art. 4,\nOct. 9, 1933, E.A.S.

Air Transport Services Agreement, U.S.-Can., art. 3, Aug. 18, 1939, E.A.S.\nNo. 159, at 1. On July 15, 1939, the United States entered into an agreement with France by\nwhich each contracting party granted, subject to its laws and regulations, in time\nof peace, \u201cliberty of passage above its territory\u201d to the registered civil aircraft of\nthe other party, and agreed that the establishment and operation of a regular air\nroute or air transport service to, over or away from the territory of the other, with\nor without stop, should be subject to the consent of the other party.
