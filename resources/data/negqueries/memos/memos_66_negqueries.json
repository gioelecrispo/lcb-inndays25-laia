      "content": "Recess Appointments Amid Pro Forma Senate Sessions A twenty-day Senate recess may give rise to presidential authority to make recess appointments. Congress\u2019s provision for pro forma sessions during that twenty-day period does not have\nthe legal effect of interrupting the recess for purposes of the Recess Appointments\nClause. In this context, the President has discretion to conclude that the Senate is unavailable to\nperform its advise-and-consent function and may exercise his power to make recess\nappointments. January 6, 2012 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT *\nOn December 17, 2011, the Senate agreed by unanimous consent to\n\u201cadjourn and convene for pro forma sessions only, with no business\nconducted,\u201d every Tuesday and Friday between that date and January 23,\n2012. 157 Cong. Rec. S8783 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2011). During that period, on January 3, 2012, the Senate convened one such pro forma session\nto begin the second session of the 112th Congress and adjourned less than\na minute later under its prior agreement. 158 Cong. Rec. S1 (daily ed.\nJan. 3, 2012); see also U.S. Const. amend. XX, \u00a7 2. You asked whether\nthe President has authority under the Recess Appointments Clause, U.S.\nConst. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 3, to make recess appointments during the period\nbetween January 3 and January 23 notwithstanding the convening of\nperiodic pro forma sessions. We advised you that he does. This opinion\nmemorializes and elaborates on that advice. This Office has consistently advised that \u201ca recess during a session of\nthe Senate, at least if it is of sufficient length, can be a \u2018Recess\u2019 within the\nmeaning of the Recess Appointments Clause\u201d during which the President\nmay exercise his power to fill vacant offices. Memorandum for Alberto R.\n* Editor\u2019s Note: The Supreme Court considered the questions addressed in this opinion\nin NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513 (2014), and held that the Recess Appointments\nClause empowers the President to fill vacancies during intrasession recesses \u201cof substantial length,\u201d but that the Senate is in session for purposes of the Clause during a pro forma\nsession in which the Senate retains the capacity to conduct business under its rules. Id. at\n527, 550. The Court therefore held that three appointments made by President Obama\nduring the period at issue in this opinion were invalid. Id. at 557. 15 36 Op. O.L.C. 15 (2012) Gonzales, Counsel to the President, from Jack L. Goldsmith III, Assistant\nAttorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Recess Appointments in\nthe Current Recess of the Senate at 1 (Feb. 20, 2004) (\u201cGoldsmith Memorandum\u201d). 1 Although the Senate will have held pro forma sessions regularly from January 3 through January 23, in our judgment, those sessions\ndo not interrupt the intrasession recess in a manner that would preclude\nthe President from determining that the Senate remains unavailable\nthroughout to \u201c\u2018receive communications from the President or participate\nas a body in making appointments.\u2019\u201d Intrasession Recess Appointments,\n13 Op. O.L.C. 271, 272 (1989) (quoting Executive Power\u2014Recess Appointments, 33 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 20, 24 (1921) (\u201cDaugherty Opinion\u201d)). Thus, the President has the authority under the Recess Appointments\nClause to make appointments during this period.",

Doc. No. 112-1, at 58 (2011) (\u201cSenate\nStanding Rules\u201d). This omission may reflect the Executive Clerk\u2019s treatment of that impending recess as a series of shorter adjournments rather\nthan a single thirty-eight-day recess. II. To address the President\u2019s authority to make recess appointments during a recess including pro forma sessions, we consider two distinct issues: The first is whether the President has authority to make a recess appointment during the recess at issue here, an intrasession recess of twenty days. We conclude that he does. The opinions of the Attorney General and this\nOffice, historical practice, and the limited judicial authority that exists all\nprovide strong support for that conclusion. Thereafter, we consider whether the President is disabled from making\nan appointment when the recess is punctuated by periodic pro forma\nsessions at which Congress has declared in advance that no business is to\nbe conducted.",

But the question addressed by the Committee in 1863\nrelated to timing of the occurrence of the vacancy, not the nature of the recess during\nwhich the vacancy occurred. Moreover, a subsequent report by the Committee defined a\nrecess functionally in terms that have since been adopted by the Attorney General and this\nOffice as setting forth the test for determining when an intrasession recess is of sufficient\nlength to give rise to the President\u2019s power under the Recess Appointments Clause.

      "content": "26 Recess Appointments Amid Pro Forma Senate Sessions have been discussed at length during litigation over a judicial recess\nappointment. See, e.g., Brief for the Intervenor United States, Stephens,\n387 F.3d 1220 (No. 02-16424); Response Brief of Plaintiffs-Appellees\nand United States Senator Edward M. Kennedy as Amicus Curiae Supporting Plaintiffs-Appellees, Stephens, 387 F.3d 1220 (No. 02-16424); see\nalso supra note 11. We conclude that the President\u2019s authority to make recess appointments\nextends to an intrasession recess of twenty days. B.\nThe second question we consider is whether Congress can prevent the\nPresident from making appointments during a recess by providing for pro\nforma sessions at which no business is to be conducted, where those pro\nforma sessions are intended to divide a longer recess into a series of\nshorter adjournments, each arguably too brief to support the President\u2019s\nrecess appointment authority. We believe that Congress\u2019s provision for\npro forma sessions of this sort does not have the legal effect of interrupting the recess of the Senate for purposes of the Recess Appointments\nClause and that the President may properly conclude that the Senate is\nunavailable for the overall duration of the recess. 13\n13 Because we conclude that pro forma sessions do not have this effect, we need not\ndecide whether the President could make a recess appointment during a three-day\nintrasession recess. This Office has not formally concluded that there is a lower limit to\nthe duration of a recess within which the President can make a recess appointment. Attorney General Daugherty suggested in dictum in his 1921 opinion that \u201can adjournment of 5 or even 10 days [could not] be said to constitute the recess intended by the\nConstitution,\u201d 33 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 25.

Therefore the executive ought to make temporary appointments, as well as\nreceive ambassadors and other public ministers. This power can be vested\nnowhere but in the executive, because he is perpetually acting for the\npublic; for, though the Senate is to advise him in the appointment of\nofficers, &c., yet, during the recess, the President must do this business,\nor else it will be neglected; and such neglect may occasion public inconveniences.\u201d); cf. Letters of Cato IV, reprinted in 2 The Complete AntiFederalist 114 (Herbert J.

Significantly, a century ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee adopted a\nfunctional understanding of the term \u201crecess\u201d that focuses on the Senate\u2019s\nability to conduct business. In rejecting the theory that President Theodore\nRoosevelt could make recess appointments during a brief \u201cconstructive\nrecess\u201d between two sessions of Congress, the Committee wrote of the\nRecess Appointments Clause: It was evidently intended by the framers of the Constitution that [the\nword \u201crecess\u201d] should mean something real, not something imaginary; something actual, not something fictitious. They used the word\nas the mass of mankind then understood it and now understand it. It\nmeans, in our judgment, . . . the period of time when the Senate is\nnot sitting in regular or extraordinary session as a branch of the\nCongress, or in extraordinary session for the discharge of executive\nfunctions; when its members owe no duty of attendance; when its\nChamber is empty; when, because of its absence, it can not receive\ncommunications from the President or participate as a body in making appointments. . . . Its sole purpose was to render it certain that at\nall times there should be, whether the Senate was in session or not,\nan officer for every office, entitled to discharge the duties thereof. S. Rep.

Our conclusion rests on three considerations. First, both the Framers\u2019 original understanding of the Recess Appointments Clause and the longstanding views of the Executive and Legislative\nBranches support the conclusion that the President may make recess\nappointments when he determines that, as a practical matter, the Senate is\nnot available to give advice and consent to executive nominations. The\nRecess Appointments Clause was adopted to allow the President to fill\noffices when the Senate was not \u201cin session for the appointment of officers.\u201d The Federalist No. 67, at 410 (Alexander Hamilton). And, from the\nearly days of the Republic, the Executive has taken the position that \u201call\nvacancies which . . . happen to exist at a time when the Senate cannot be\nconsulted as to filling them, may be temporarily filled by the President.\u201d Executive Authority to Fill Vacancies, 1 Op.

Likewise,\nin 1905, the Senate Judiciary Committee defined \u201crecess\u201d as used in the\nClause to be the period of time when the Senate cannot \u201cparticipate as a\nbody in making appointments.\u201d S. Rep. No. 58-4389, at 2. We do not believe that the convening of periodic pro forma sessions\nprecludes the President from determining that the Senate is unavailable\nduring an intrasession recess otherwise long enough to support the President\u2019s recess appointment authority. During the last three Congresses,\nsuch sessions ordinarily have lasted only a few seconds. See, e.g., 157\nCong. Rec. D1404 (daily ed. Dec. 30, 2011) (noting that day\u2019s pro forma\nsession lasted from 11:00:02 until 11:00:34 a.m.); see also supra note 2.\n33 36 Op. O.L.C. 15 (2012) Records of the sessions typically do not disclose the presence of any\nSenator other than the single convening member. See, e.g., 157 Cong.\nRec. S8793 (daily ed. Dec. 30, 2011) (reflecting the presence of only\nSenator Reed). And importantly, the pertinent Senate order states in\nadvance that there is to be \u201cno business conducted\u201d during the ensuing\nsessions. See, e.g., 157 Cong. Rec. S8783 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2011); see\nalso supra pp. 16\u201317. 17 The purpose of these sessions avowedly is not to\nconduct business; instead, either the Senate has intended to prevent the\nPresident from making recess appointments during its absence or the\nHouse has intended to require the Senate to remain in session (toward the\nsame end). See supra pp. 17\u201318; see also Henry B. Hogue, Cong. Research Serv., RS21308, Recess Appointments: Frequently Asked Questions 3 (rev.

We recognize that, as a\npractical matter, neither the scheduling order nor the quorum requirement will always\nprevent the Senate from acting without a quorum through unanimous consent. Indeed,\nthe Senate has occasionally enacted legislation by unanimous consent during pro forma\nsessions. See infra p. 45. But as more fully explained below, we do not believe that this\nsporadic practice requires the President to consider the Senate available to perform its\nconstitutional functions when it is in recess and, particularly, when it has provided by\norder that no business will be conducted. 34 Recess Appointments Amid Pro Forma Senate Sessions erty Opinion, 33 Op.

That opinion addressed the propriety of making recess appointments during a recess that began on January 3, 1992, and ended on\nJanuary 21, 1992. We noted that, aside from a \u201cbrief formal session on\nJanuary 3\u201d at which the body conducted no business (and which evidently\nwas held to address the terms of the Twentieth Amendment, see infra note\n22), the Senate had been in recess since November 27, 1991. 16 Op.\nO.L.C. at 15 n.1. Thus, we observed that \u201c[f]or practical purposes with In reaching this conclusion, we need not look behind the actual terms of the Senate\u2019s\norders. The Senate itself labels the sessions \u201cpro forma\u201d and specifies that there is to be\n\u201cno business conducted\u201d during those sessions. See, e.g., 157 Cong. Rec. S8783 (daily ed.\nDec. 17, 2011). These orders make clear that the Senate cannot perform its advise-andconsent role during the pro forma sessions. The issue we have been asked to address\nrelates to the legal effect of such sessions on the intrasession recess, and the Senate orders\non their face warrant the conclusion that the Senate is unavailable to provide advice and\nconsent during the intrasession recess. 18 35 36 Op. O.L.C. 15 (2012) respect to nominations, this recess closely resembles one of substantially\ngreater length.\u201d Id. To be sure, this Office there stated only that two\nrecesses broken solely by a pro forma session \u201cclosely resemble[]\u201d a\nsingle recess of greater length, not that they were constitutionally indistinguishable from one. Nevertheless, we thought the effective length of the\nrecess relevant in determining whether the President could make a recess\nappointment. The same consideration applies here. A lengthy intrasession\nrecess broken only by pro forma sessions closely resembles an unbroken\nrecess of the same length; thus, \u201c[e]xcept for its brief formal session[s]\n. . . the Senate will have been absent from [January 3, 2012] until [January\n23, 2012], a period of [twenty] days.\u201d Id. And in determining whether\nsuch a recess triggers the President\u2019s appointment authority under the\nRecess Appointments Clause, we believe the critical inquiry is the \u201cpractical\u201d one identified above\u2014to wit, whether the Senate is available to\nperform its advise-and-consent function. For practical purposes, the\nPresident may properly view the Senate as unavailable for twenty days. Second, allowing the Senate to prevent the President from exercising\nhis authority under the Recess Appointments Clause by holding pro forma\nsessions would be inconsistent with both the purpose of the Clause and\nhistorical practice in analogous situations.",

Second, allowing the Senate to prevent the President from exercising\nhis authority under the Recess Appointments Clause by holding pro forma\nsessions would be inconsistent with both the purpose of the Clause and\nhistorical practice in analogous situations. As explained above, the Recess\nAppointments Clause has long been understood as intended to provide a\nmethod of appointment when the Senate was unavailable to provide\nadvice and consent, so that offices would not remain vacant to the detriment of the public interest. If the Senate can avoid a \u201cRecess of the Senate\u201d under the Clause by having a single Member \u201cgavel in\u201d before an\nempty chamber, then the Senate can preclude the President from making\nrecess appointments even when, as a practical matter, it is unavailable to\nfulfill its constitutional role in the appointment process for a significant\nperiod of time. The purpose of the Clause is better served by a construction that permits the President to make recess appointments when the\nSenate is unavailable to advise and consent for lengthy periods. See Power of President to Fill Vacancies, 2 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 525, 526\u201327 (1832)\n(\u201c[A] construction that defeats the very object of the grant of power\ncannot be the true one.

Wright v. United States, 302 U.S.\n36 Recess Appointments Amid Pro Forma Senate Sessions 583, 596 (1938) (\u201cWe should not adopt a construction [of the Veto Clauses] which would frustrate either of the[ir] purposes.\u201d). Further, Presidents have routinely exercised their constitutional authority to make recess appointments between sessions of Congress since President Washington made such appointments in the earliest days of the\nRepublic. Although we have focused in this opinion on the twenty-day\nintrasession recess at the beginning of the second session, the Senate in\nfact adjourned pursuant to an order that provided that there would also be\n\u201cno business conducted\u201d for the final seventeen days of the first session. This period of time, a total of thirty-seven days, in substance closely\nresembles a lengthy intersession recess. See Recess Appointments During\nan Intrasession Recess, 16 Op. O.L.C. at 15 n.1.

Inhofe) (\u201c[Senator Byrd] extracted from [the President] a commitment\nin writing that he would not make recess appointments and, if it should become necessary\nbecause of extraordinary circumstances to make recess appointments, that he would give\nthe list to the majority leader . . . in sufficient time in advance that they could prepare for\nit either by agreeing in advance to the confirmation of that appointment or by not going\ninto recess and staying in pro forma so the recess appointments could not take place.\u201d). 25 For example, in 1929, a concurrent resolution provided that the House return from\nsummer recess on September 23, 71 Cong. Rec. 3045 (June 18, 1929). The House passed\na separate resolution providing that \u201cafter September 23, 1929, the House shall meet only\non Mondays and Thursdays of each week until October 14, 1929,\u201d provided that the\nSpeaker could call them back sooner if \u201clegislative expediency shall warrant it,\u201d id. at\n3228 (June 19, 1929).

Assuming that such uses are constitutional,\nhowever, it does not follow that pro forma sessions may be used to prevent the President from exercising his constitutional authority to make\nrecess appointments when he determines that the Senate is unavailable to\nprovide advice and consent. 26 Put differently, whether the House has\nconsented to the Senate\u2019s adjournment of more than three days does not\ndetermine the Senate\u2019s practical availability during a period of pro forma\nsessions and thus does not determine the existence of a \u201cRecess\u201d under\nthe Recess Appointments Clause. Second, it might be argued that, in light of the Senate\u2019s power to \u201cdetermine the Rules of its Proceedings,\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 5, cl. 2, the\nExecutive Branch would be bound by the Chamber\u2019s own understanding\nof whether the pro forma sessions have the legal effect of interrupting a\n\u201cRecess of the Senate\u201d for the purposes of the Recess Appointments\nClause. The Rules of Proceedings Clause has been understood to grant the\nHouses of Congress broad discretion in managing their internal affairs. See, e.g., United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892) (\u201c[A]ll matters of\nmethod [of proceeding] are open to the determination of the house, and it\nis no impeachment of the rule to say that some other way would be better,\nmore accurate or even more just.\u201d). That Clause might also be understood\nto permit them conclusively to determine when they are in session and\nwhen they are in recess. See, e.g., Michael Herz, Abandoning Recess\nAppointments?: A Comment on Hartnett (and Others), 26 Cardozo L.\nRev. 443, 459 (2005) (\u201cI would think that pursuant to the authority of\neach House to make rules for its own proceedings Congress could decide\nto hold twelve \u2018sessions\u2019 each calendar year, with a few days off\u2014\nperhaps just a weekend\u2014between them.\u201d); cf.

Dixon, Assistant Attorney General, Office of\nLegal Counsel at 4 \u20135 (Dec. 4, 1973) (\u201cUnder Section 2 of H.R. 7386, Congress could\nprevent the exercise of a pocket veto, except at the close of a Congress, when one or both\nHouses adjourned for several months, by adjourning either to a date certain or pro forma\nto a date close to the beginning of the next working session. . . . To the extent that H.R.\n7386 unconstitutionally permits Congress to keep a bill in suspended animation for\nlengthy periods during adjournments other than sine die, it unconstitutionally narrows the\nPresident\u2019s pocket veto authority.\u201d). 26 43 36 Op. O.L.C. 15 (2012) Rev. 557, 567 (1972) (\u201cSurely the determination of what constitutes\nadjournment is a \u2018proceeding\u2019 within the terms of that section [the\nRules of Proceeding Clause].\u201d). The Supreme Court, however, has made clear that Congress\u2019s power\nunder this provision is not unlimited, and specifically that Congress \u201cmay\nnot by its rules ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental\nrights.\u201d Ballin, 144 U.S. at 5. Thus, the validity and application of congressional rules are subject to review in court when the rules affect interests outside of the Legislative Branch. See, e.g., United States v. Smith,\n286 U.S. 6, 33 (1932) (\u201cAs the construction to be given the rules affects\npersons other than members of the Senate, the question presented is of\nnecessity a judicial one.\u201d); Ballin, 144 U.S. at 5 (\u201c[T]here should be a\nreasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is sought to be attained.\u201d); Vander\nJagt v. O\u2019Neill, 699 F.2d 1166, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (\u201cArticle I does not\nalter our judicial responsibility to say what rules Congress may not adopt\nbecause of constitutional infirmity.\u201d). A Senate rule that pro forma sessions interrupt a \u201cRecess of the Senate\u201d (or that otherwise seeks to prevent the President from exercising authority under the Recess Appointments Clause) would affect other persons\u2014the President and potential\nappointees at the least. It would also disrupt the Constitution\u2019s balancing\nof executive and legislative authority in the appointments process. To be\nsure, as explained above, the President\u2019s authority to make recess appointments is constrained when the Senate is continuously in session and\navailable to perform its advise-and-consent function. But the Senate could\nnot by rule unilaterally prevent the President from exercising his authority\nto make temporary appointments under the Clause by declaring itself in\nsession when, in practice, it is not available to provide advice and consent, any more than the President could make a recess appointment when\nthe Senate was in practice available to do so. See Daugherty Opinion, 33\nOp.

Twice in 2011, the Senate passed legislation during pro forma sessions by\nunanimous consent, evidenced by the lack of objection from any member\nwho might have been present at the time. 157 Cong. Rec. S8789 (daily ed.\nDec. 23, 2011); id. at S5297 (daily ed. Aug. 5, 2011). During one of these\nsessions, the Senate also agreed to a conference with the House, and\nmessages received from the House earlier in the intrasession recess were\nput into the Congressional Record. 157 Cong. Rec. S8789\u201390 (daily ed.\nDec. 23, 2011). Conceivably, the Senate might provide advice and consent on pending nominations during a pro forma session in the same\nmanner. We do not believe, however, that these examples prevent the President\nfrom determining that the Senate remains unavailable to provide advice\nand consent during the present intrasession recess. The scheduling order\nunder which the pro forma sessions are held during this recess expressly\nprovides that there is to be \u201cno business conducted.\u201d 157 Cong. Rec.\nS8783 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2001). In our judgment, the President may\nproperly rely on the public pronouncements of the Senate that it will not\nconduct business (including action on nominations), in determining\nwhether the Senate remains in recess, regardless of whether the Senate has\ndisregarded its own orders on prior occasions. Moreover, even absent a\nSenate pronouncement that it will not conduct business, there may be\ncircumstances in which the President could properly conclude that the\nbody is not available to provide advice and consent for a sufficient period\nto support the use of his recess appointment power. It is common for\nSawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952). The Constitution explicitly grants recess appointment\nauthority to the President, and the Attorney General has long taken the position that,\nthrough enactment of the Pay Act, Congress has \u201cacquiesce[d]\u201d to recess appointments\nunder circumstances where that Act would permit payment. See Recess Appointments, 41\nOp. Att\u2019y Gen. at 466; see also Appointments\u2014Recess Appointments, 28 Comp. Gen. at\n34, 37 (recognizing the \u201caccepted view\u201d that an extended intrasession adjournment of the\nSenate is a \u201crecess\u201d in the constitutional sense during which \u201can appointment properly\nmay be made\u201d and that recipients of such appointments were entitled to pay). Moreover, it\nis unclear that Justice Jackson\u2019s framework would apply in matters involving the balance\nbetween the President\u2019s constitutional authority to make recess appointments and a single\nHouse of Congress\u2019s constitutional authority to set its internal rules. 45",

O.L.C. 15 (2012) resolutions of adjournment authorizing extended intrasession recesses to\nprovide that the Senate \u201cstand[s] recessed or adjourned until [a specified\ndate], . . . or until the time of any reassembly\u201d ordered by the leaders of\nthe two Houses \u201cas they may designate whenever, in their opinion, the\npublic interest shall warrant it.\u201d See, e.g., H.R. Con. Res. 361, 108th\nCong. (2004). That potential for reassembly by itself does not deprive an\nextended Senate absence of its character as a recess. In fact, the Senate\nhad adjourned pursuant to such a resolution before the intrasession recess\nduring which Judge Pryor was appointed to the Eleventh Circuit. That\nrecess appointment was approved by this Office, see Goldsmith Memorandum, and upheld by the court of appeals en banc, see Evans v. Stephens, 387 F.3d 1220. Fourth, legal precedent addressing the President\u2019s authority to pocket\nveto during a recess a bill passed by Congress conceivably might be\nviewed as constraining the President\u2019s recess appointment authority in the\ncurrent recess. For example, in Wright v. United States, 302 U.S. 583, the\nSupreme Court held that a temporary adjournment of the Senate (for\nwhich consent of the House was not required under Article I, Section 5,\nClause 4 of the Constitution) did not prevent the President from vetoing a\nbill. And in Kennedy v. Sampson, 511 F.2d 430 (D.C. Cir. 1974), the D.C.\nCircuit extended Wright to reach all intrasession adjournments, provided\nthat arrangements were made for the receipt of presidential messages. 28 It\ncould be argued that these cases either delineate the types of Senate adjournments that are insufficient to qualify as a \u201cRecess of the Senate\u201d\nunder the Recess Appointments Clause, or establish that the Senate can\ntake some action short of actually remaining in session to mitigate the\nconsequences of its absence. We have previously observed that \u201c[w]hile the Pocket Veto and Recess\nAppointments Clauses deal with similar situations, that is, the President\u2019s\npowers while Congress or the Senate is not in session, their language, effects, and purposes are by no means identical.\u201d Recess Appointments Issues,\n6 Op. O.L.C. 585, 589 (1982). And \u201c[i]n light of the[se] differen[ces] . . . we\ndo not believe [that Sampson] should be read as having any significant\nIn Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21, 41 (D.C. Cir. 1985), the court held that the President is not \u201cprevent[ed]\u201d from returning a bill even during an intersession recess if a duly\nauthorized officer of the originating house is available to receive it. That decision was\nlater vacated as moot. See Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361 (1987). 28 46 Recess Appointments Amid Pro Forma Senate Sessions bearing on the proper interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause.\u201d Id.\nat 590.

Moreover, we have concluded that \u201cthere are sound reasons to believe that the President has authority to make recess appointments in situations in which a pocket veto might well be inappropriate.\u201d The Pocket Veto:\nHistorical Practice and Judicial Precedent, 6 Op. O.L.C. 134, 149 (1982). The Pocket Veto Clause \u201censures that the President will not be deprived of his constitutional power to veto a bill by reason of an adjournment.\u201d Recess Appointments Issues, 6 Op. O.L.C. at 590. The holdings in\nWright and Sampson\u2014that the President could not pocket veto a bill\nduring an intrasession recess where the Senate had designated an agent to\nreceive the return of a bill\u2014were \u201cbottomed on the theory that [the adjournments at issue] did not \u2018prevent\u2019 the return of disapproved bills.\u201d The\nPocket Veto, 6 Op. O.L.C. at 149. Put another way, the designation of an\nagent to receive messages and the pocket veto serve the same purpose,\ni.e., protecting the President\u2019s right to disapprove bills, and therefore\nobviate the need for the power provided by the Clause. The Recess Appointments Clause, however, serves a different purpose. It\n\u201cenables the President to fill vacancies which exist while the Senate is\nunable to give its advice and consent because it is in recess.\u201d Recess Appointments Issues, 6 Op. O.L.C. at 590. The designation of an agent to\nreceive messages neither allows the President to fill vacancies nor makes the\nSenate available to advise and consent. Thus, the President\u2019s ability to make\nappointments during a recess is necessary to further the Recess Appointments Clause\u2019s purpose, while the President\u2019s authority to pocket veto\narguably is not necessary when the presence of a congressional agent allows\nhim to return a bill, exercising his constitutional prerogative to disapprove\nlegislation. While the congressional designation of an agent arguably addresses the constitutional concerns embodied in the President\u2019s pocket veto\nauthority, the periodic convening of pro forma sessions at which no business\nis to be conducted simply does not address the constitutional concerns\narising from the Senate\u2019s unavailability to consider appointments. Finally, we considered whether the Department of Justice has already taken a different view. In arguing that the recess appointment of a member of\nthe National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d) did not render moot the\ncontroversy about legal consequences of the absence of a Board quorum, the\nSolicitor General said that \u201cthe Senate may act to foreclose [recess appointments] by declining to recess for more than two or three days at a time over\n47 36 Op.
