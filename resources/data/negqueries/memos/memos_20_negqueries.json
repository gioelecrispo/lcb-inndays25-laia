The threshold, and ultimately dispositive, question presented here is whether\nthe Clean Air Fee, to the extent it applies to property owned by the United States,\nis a \u201c tax\u201d or a \u201c fee.\u201d This question would necessarily arise in connection with\nany fee imposed on the federal government by a state or local government, be\u00ad\ncause the federal government is immune from state and local taxation. See\nMcCulloch v. M aryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 436 (1819) (\u201c [T]he states have\nno power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner\ncontrol the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry into\nexecution the powers vested in the general government.\u201d ). It has long been estab\u00ad\nlished that a state or local government cannot impose a tax upon the United States,\nits agencies, or its instrumentalities \u201c without a clear congressional mandate.\u201d Kem-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U.S. 110, 122 (1954). The \u201c tax or fee\u201d question arises in a unique context here because the federal\ngovernment has divided the legislative authority for the District between Congress\nand the D.C. Council. As the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has summa\u00ad\nrized:\nThe United States Constitution vests Congress with the exclusive\nlegislative authority for the District of Columbia.

D istrict o f Colum bia v. Greater Washington Cent.

Subsection (a)(1) of \u00a71-233 provides that \u201c [t]he Council shall have\nno authority to . . . [ijmpose any tax on property of the United States or any\nof the several states.\u201d Thus, if the Clean Air Fee is a \u201c tax on property of the\nUnited States,\u201d then the D.C. Council lacked the authority to impose it.3\nII. A tax is an \u201c enforced contribution to provide for the support of government.\u201d United States v. LaFranca, 282 U.S. 568, 572 (1931). In distinguishing between government taxes and fees, courts have identified two different types of fees:\n\u201c user or service fees\u201d and \u201cregulatory fees.\u201d The D.C. Council imposed the\nClean Air Fee on owners of parking spaces in the District and directed that reve\u00ad\nnues from the Fee be used exclusively to subsidize the mass transit system. For\nthe reasons set forth below, we conclude that the Fee does not qualify as either\na \u201c user or service fee\u201d or a \u201c regulatory fee\u201d but is instead an \u201c enforced con\u00ad\ntribution to provide for the support o f government.\u201d Id . 4\n2 This O ffice has consistently expressed the sam e understanding o f the limitations on the D.C. Council\u2019s authority. For exam ple, in 1976 we opined that the legislative power o f the D.C. Council\nis subject to careful reservations by the Congress o f its ow n constitutional powers and to specific limitations\nincluded in title V I o f the Home Rule Act. Indeed, the very grant o f pow er in section 404(a) begins with\nthe words, \u201c (sjubject to the limitations specified in title V I o f this Act, . . Thus there are real limits\non the C ouncil\u2019s authority to act. The most specific o f those title VI limitations are set forth in Section 602 [D.C. Code 1981, \u00a7 1-233]\no f the Home Rule Act. Memorandum for H ugh M. D urham, Legislative Counsel, Office o f Legislative Affairs, from Mary C.

C ouncil\u2019s authority are both implicated by the \u201c tax o r fee\u201d question. If the Clean Air Fee is a \u201c tax,\u201d\nthen under either principle only Congress could authorize the imposition o f the tax on the United States. It is important\nto recognize, how ever, that congressional authorization o f the D istrict\u2019s tax w ould require tw o analytically distinct\nsteps, whereas congressional authorization o f o th e r state and local taxes requires only one. Congress may waive\nfederal immunity against a properly enacted state or local tax, acting solely in its capacity as legislature for the\nUnited States. O n the other hand, for Congress to authorize the D istrict\u2019s C lean Air Fee, it must both waive federal\nimmunity and either authorize the D.C. Council to impose the tax (acting as legislature for the United States) or\nimpose the tax directly itself (acting as legislature fo r the District). 4 In light o f this conclusion, there is no need to consider the argument that the Clean A ir Fee falls within the\nscope o f the w aiver o f federal immunity against state and local taxation and regulation set forth in section 118\nof the federal C lean A ir Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a77418. See Corporation Counsel Letter at 3-7. For even if the Fee satisfies\nthe terms o f that w aiver, it may not be imposed on the United States because its enactment was beyond the D.C. 14 Whether the District o f Columbia\u2019s Clean A ir Compliance Fee May Be Collected From the Federal\nGovernment A.\nCentral to the analysis of whether a government levy is a user or service fee\nor instead a tax is whether it is imposed to collect payment for a benefit or service\nprovided by the government to the specific payor as a result of a voluntary act\nby the payor, or whether instead the payment is viewed as a mandatory contribu\u00ad\ntion for the general support of the government. The clearest Supreme Court guid\u00ad\nance on whether an exaction is a tax or a user or service fee is set forth in N ational\nCable Television A ss\u2019n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336 (1974). In considering\nwhether a fee imposed by the Federal Communications Commission was a tax\nand therefore beyond the FCC\u2019s authority, the Court opined:\nTaxation is a legislative function, and Congress, which is the sole\norgan for levying taxes, may act arbitrarily and disregard benefits\nbestowed by the Government on a taxpayer and go solely on ability\nto pay, based on property or income. A fee, however, is incident\nto a voluntary act, e.g., a request that a public agency permit an\napplicant to practice law or medicine or construct a house or run\na broadcast station. The public agency performing those services\nnormally may exact a fee for a grant which, presumably, bestows\na benefit on the applicant, not shared by other members of soci\u00ad\nety.",

City o f Huntington, W.Va., 999 F.2d 71 (4th Cir. 1993),\ncert, denied, 510 U.S. 1109 (1994), the court applied a facts-and-circumstances test to determine whether a so-called \u201c municipal service fee,\u201d consisting of a\n\u201c fire service fee\u201d and a \u201c flood protection fee,\u201d imposed upon property owners\nin Huntington, West Virginia, including federal agencies, was a tax upon the\nC ouncil\u2019s authority under the Self-Government Act. W aivers o f immunity apply only to properly enacted state and\nlocal measures. Nor is there a need to ascertain the scope o f the Clean Air Act waiver o f federal immunity in order to conclude\nthat there is no basis for construing that w aiver as an implied repeal o f the Self-Government A ct\u2019s limitation on\nthe authority of the D.C. Council. The District did not make this implied repeal argument in its submission to\nthis Office, see Corporation Counsel Letter, but the argument was analyzed in a Congressional Research Service\nmemorandum concerning the Clean Air Fee, see M emorandum by George Costello, American Law Division, Congres\u00ad\nsional Research Service, Re: Application o f District o f Columbia \" Clean Air Compliance Fee Act\" to the Federal\nGovernment at 6 -7 (Mar. 24, 1995). We believe the argument has no merit. It is a well-established principle o f\nstatutory construction that \u201c repeals by implication are strongly disfavored.\u201d United Stales v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439,\n452 (1988). \u2018\u2018[A] later statute will not be held to have implicitly repealed an earlier one unless there is a clear\nrepugnancy between the tw o.\u201d Id. at 453 (citations omitted). There is no repugnancy between the Self-Government\nAct and the subsequently enacted section 118 o f the Clean A ir Act. They address fundamentally different subjects:\nthe latter addresses federal immunity (i.e., the relationship between the federal government and state and local govern\u00ad\nments), while the former addresses D.C. Council legislative authority ( i.e\u201e the relationship between Congress and\nthe D.C. Council). Moreover, neither the text nor the legislative history o f Clean A ir Act section 118 contain the\nslightest indication that during its deliberations on waiving federal immunity Congress gave any thought to the legisla\u00ad\ntive authority of the D.C.

The\ncourt held that the municipal service fee was \u201c a thinly disguised tax\u201d because\nthe federal agencies\u2019 liability for the fee \u201c arises from [their] status as property\nowners and not from their use of a City service.\u201d Id. In U nited States v. C ity of Columbia, Mo., 914 F.2d 151 (8th Cir. 1990), the\ncourt considered whether a levy charged by a city as part of the price of water\nand electricity was a tax or a fee. Even though the levy was described in the\napplicable city ordinance as being in lieu of a tax, the court held that the levy\nwas part of the utility rate and was unlike a tax in many significant respects:\nit was not contained in a section dealing with the city\u2019s taxing power; it was\ncharged to the customer as part o f the price of electricity and water; and failure\nto pay the levy would result in termination of services rather than subject the\ncustomer to penalties. As for the levy\u2019s application to the federal government,\nthe court said that\n[t]he United States\u2019 obligation to pay the [levy arose] only from\nits consensual purchase of the City\u2019s [water and electricity]; it d[id]\nnot arise automatically, as does tax liability, from the United States\u2019\nstatus as a property owner, resident, or income earner. When the\nUnited States purchases water, electricity, and related services, and\nthen pays the utility bill, it does so as a vendee pursuant to its\nvoluntary, contractual relationship with the City. The City imposes\nthe charge not in its capacity as a sovereign, but as a vendor of\ngoods and services. Id. at 155-56 (citing National C able Television, 415 U.S. at 340-41). The results in Columbia and Huntington represent straightforward applications\nof the Supreme Court\u2019s approach in National Cable Television. In Columbia, the levy was held not to be a tax because the federal agency voluntarily used certain\namounts of electricity and water and the levy was for the service actually provided\nto the agency. In contrast, in Huntington the assessment was not based on actual\nfire and flood services that had been provided on request, but rather represented\na charge to property owners for fire and flood protection available to all inhab\u00ad\nitants of the city; thus, it was a tax \u2014 a mandatory contribution for the support\nof government services provided to the entire public. The Clean Air Fee cannot qualify as a user or service fee because the revenue\nfrom the Fee is used to provide an undifferentiated benefit to the entire public. The Fee is indistinguishable for present purposes from the assessment to support\ncommunity-wide services that was held to be a tax in Huntington.

It is not a\n16 Whether the District o f Columbia\u2019s Clean A ir Compliance Fee May Be Collected From the Federal\nGovernment charge for any identifiable District services provided specifically to the owners\nof parking spaces upon their request. Rather, it is a charge to support the mass\ntransit services the District provides to all inhabitants (permanent and temporary)\nof the District. Such services, as was the case with the \u201c [f]ire and flood protection\nand street maintenance [services at issue in Huntington ,] are core government serv\u00ad\nices\u201d available to all inhabitants of the city. Huntington, 999 F.2d at 73. The court\u2019s rationale in Huntington is fully applicable here: If the argument\nthat the Clean Air Fee is a user fee rather than a tax were to be accepted, then\n\u201c virtually all of what now are considered \u2018taxes\u2019 could be transmuted into \u2018user\nfees\u2019 by the simple expedient of dividing what are generally accepted as taxes\ninto constituent parts, e.g., a \u2018police fee.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 74. Taxes imposed on property\nowners are traditionally used to support government services for the whole com\u00ad\nmunity, and the Clean Air Fee is no different. Moreover, in contrast to the levy held to be a fee in Columbia, the United\nStates\u2019 obligation to pay the Clean Air Fee does not arise from any consensual\npurchase of a good or service from the District, but rather arises automatically\nfrom its status as a property owner. See Columbia, 914 F.2d at 155. The United\nStates is in no respect acting \u201c as a vendee pursuant to its voluntary, contractual\nrelationship with the [District].\u201d Id. at 156. In short, the District has \u201c impose[d]\nthe charge . . . in its capacity as a sovereign, [not] as a vendor of goods and\nservices.\u201d Id. Also in contrast to the Columbia fee, the District will enforce the\nFee through civil penalties, not the denial of any supposed benefit that the Fee\nmakes possible. B. The case law concerning whether a government levy is a regulatory fee or a\ntax was summarized by then-Chief Judge Breyer of the First Circuit Court of\nAppeals in San Juan Cellular Telephone v.

In Judge Breyer\u2019s terms, the Fee \u201c is im\u00ad\nposed by a legislature [the Council] upon many, or all, citizens [all owners of\nemployment parking spaces]. It raises money, contributed to a general fund, and\nspent for the benefit of the entire community [the account funding the District\u2019s\nsubsidy for mass transit, which is a service available to the entire community].\u201d Id. In other words, the Fee is imposed by a legislative body on property owners\nto raise revenue; it is not imposed by a \u201c [regulatory] agency upon those subject\nto its regulation.\u201d Id. Moreover, the fact that the Fee applies only if the District\u2019s\nsales and use tax has not been imposed already on the parking service for the\nvehicle also suggests that the Fee is a tax, because it indicates that the Fee is\nintended to complement the parking tax. Indeed, the D.C. Council indicated as\nmuch in its report on the Act when it stated that \u201c [t]he fee will only be imposed\non persons who do not currently pay the District\u2019s parking tax.\u201d Council Report\nat 10. The District\u2019s argument that the Clean Air Fee is a regulatory fee is as follows: We conclude that the District is required by the Federal Clean\nAir Act to reduce, eliminate and control sources of air pollution\nand that the monetary exaction imposed by the Clean Air Compli\u00ad\nance Fee Act is designed to encourage the use of mass transit and\ndecrease air pollution associated with automobile traffic. Inasmuch\nas the primary purpose of this exaction is the control and abatement\nof air pollution, we conclude that this exaction is a \u201c fee\u201d not a\n\u201c tax.\u201d\nCorporation Counsel Letter at 3. As a threshold matter, it is open to question whether it is correct to view the\nFee\u2019s primary purpose as being to regulate air pollution by automobile traffic rath\u00ad\ner than to raise revenue for mass transit that benefits the general public. The fact\nthat the proceeds of the Fee are to be allocated entirely to support the mass transit\nsystem strongly suggests that the primary purpose of the Fee is to raise revenue\nto support government operations.

In addition,\nalthough discouraging the use of automobiles for commuting no doubt does serve\n18 Whether the District o f Columbia\u2019s Clean A ir Compliance Fee May Be Collected From the Federal\nGovernment air pollution regulatory purposes, the actual reduction in automobile commuting\nthat can be expected here, as a result of the imposition of the Fee, is indirect\nand speculative compared to the direct and immediate revenue impact and support\nfor mass transit that will result. 5 In any event, even assuming that the Clean Air Fee falls in the middle of the\nfee-tax spectrum, following Judge Breyer\u2019s focus on the revenue\u2019s ultimate use\nleads to the conclusion that this exaction is a tax. To accept the District\u2019s charac\u00ad\nterization would require that we conclude either that subsidizing mass transit is\na regulation-related cost of the District\u2019s air pollution regulatory program or that\nthe assumed regulatory impact of the Fee on air pollution (as a result of reduced\nautomobile commuting and increased use of mass transit) is sufficient by itself\nto render it a regulatory fee notwithstanding the remaining aspects of the Fee\nthat all suggest it is a tax. With respect to the first of these alternatives, while\nwe do not doubt that encouraging the use of mass transit can have a beneficial\neffect on air pollution, the costs of a separate, non-regulatory government program\nthat benefits the public as a whole are not the kind of costs that courts have\nviewed as defrayable by regulatory fees. See supra pp. 17-19. The subsidization\nof mass transit is not a regulatory cost, but rather a general government expense\ntypically defrayed by taxes: subsidization of mass transit \u201c provides a general ben\u00ad\nefit to the public, of a sort often financed by a general tax.\u201d San Juan Cellular\nTelephone, 967 F.2d at 685. As for the second alternative, the simple response is that ascribing a regulatory\npurpose to a tax does not mean that it is not a tax. Taxes often have a significant\nregulatory purpose: \u201c [A] tax is a powerful regulatory device; a legislature can\ndiscourage or eliminate a particular activity that is within its regulatory jurisdiction\nsimply by imposing a heavy tax on its exercise.\u201d Massachusetts v. United States,\n435 U.S. 444, 455-56 (1978). See also National Cable Television A ss\u2019n v. United\nStates, 415 U.S. 336, 341 (1974) (\u201c The lawmaker may, in light of the \u2018public\npolicy or interest served,\u2019 make the assessment heavy if the lawmaker wants to\ndiscourage the activity; or it may make the levy slight if a bounty is to be be\u00ad\nstowed . . . . Such assessments are in the nature of \u2018taxes\u2019 . . . .\u201d ). Thus, the\nfact that discouraging automobile commuting is one of the stated reasons for the\nClean Air Fee does not convert it from a tax into a regulatory fee when its rev\u00ad\nenue-raising purpose in support of separate, non-regulatory government operations\nis so direct and substantial.",

[T]he\nDistrict\u2019s subsidy to support WMATA was reduced by $7.2 million in the current budget year. This reduction left\nWMATA underfunded by approximately $7 million. The Committee on Regional Authorities proposed to m ake up\nthe $7 million by implementing a series o f transfer charges and fare increases on District Metrobus service. . . .\n[Councilwoman Mason] has proposed that the revenue from these bills be used to fund the W MATA deficits thereby\nmaking the fare and transfer charge proposals unnecessary. \u2019 \u2019). See also id. at 6. 19 Opinions of the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 20 in San Juan C ellular Telephone and the cases cited in Judge Breyer\u2019s opinion\nin that case. In San Juan, the court held that a three percent of gross revenues\ncharge imposed on a telephone company by the Puerto Rico Public Service Com\u00ad\nmission as a condition of the company\u2019s authorization to provide cellular tele\u00ad\nphone service was a regulatory fee. Judge Breyer stressed that the fee was assessed\nby a regulatory agency, was placed in a special fund, and was not to be used\nfor a general purpose but rather to defray specific costs of regulation (investigative\nexpenses, hiring of services, and acquisition of equipment). 967 F.2d at 686. His\nopinion distinguished the case before the court, as well as other cited examples\nof regulatory fees,6 from those cases that had held charges to be taxes because\nthe proceeds from the charges were used for general purposes or to raise general\nrevenue. 7\nSchneider Transport, Inc. v. Cattanach is particularly instructive for our pur\u00ad\nposes. In that case, it was argued that truck registration fees imposed on trucking\ncompanies were \u201c regulatory licensing fees.\u201d The Seventh Circuit rejected this\nargument, finding that \u201c [although not denominated as such, the registration fees\nare imposed for revenue-raising purposes, a characteristic of any tax . . . [, and]\n[t]he fees are deposited in a segregated fund, the state transportation fund, for\ntransportation purposes, including highway construction.\u201d 657 F.2d at 132 (cita\u00ad\ntions omitted).

The\ncourt easily concluded that the charge was not a tax because it was authorized\nby Congress pursuant to its commerce power rather than taxing power, citing\nWickard v. F ilbum , 317 U.S. I l l (1942), for the proposition that \u201c [t]he imposi\u00ad\ntion of assessments have long been held to be a legitimate means of regulating\ncommerce.\u201d 717 F.2d at 887.8 Block does not support the position that the Clean Air Fee is a regulatory fee,\nbecause the charge addressed in that case differed from the Fee in two funda\u00ad\nmental respects: it was imposed on regulated parties, not property owners, and,\nmost significantly, the revenue raised from the charge was used only for the spe\u00ad\ncific regulatory program of which it was a part, and to which the regulated parties\nwere subject, not to support government operations in a separate, non-regulatory\nprogram that benefits the public generally. C.\nThe \u201c tax or fee\u201d cases cited by the Office of the Corporation Counsel, see\nCorporation Counsel Letter at 2, included both user or service fee cases and regu\u00ad\nlatory fee cases. The cited cases are consistent with our conclusion that the Clean\nAir Fee is a tax and not a fee. For example, in Valandra v. Viedt, 259 N.W.2d\n510 (S.D. 1977), the court held that a \u201c mobile home license fee\u201d was principally\na tax because \u201c 85% of the fee collected [allocated to the county highway and\nbridge fund] is for revenue purposes and bears no relationship to the cost of ad\u00ad\nministering the [mobile home] registration system,\u201d and only the fifteen percent\nallocated \u201c to defray costs of titling, registration and for unusual use of the high\u00ad\nway\u201d was arguably a fee. Id. at 512. Similarly, the Clean Air Fee is allocated\nto support a mass transit system and is not tied to any governmental service or\n8 The two cases cited in this regard by the Block court each held that administrative sanctions imposed against\nfarmers for exceeding marketing quotas were authorized under the commerce pow er and did not constitute taxes. See United States v. Stangland, 242 F.2d 843, 848 (7th Cir. 1957); Rodgers v. United Stales, 138 F.2d 992, 994\n(6th Cir. 1943). The central rationale o f the cases was that the charge in question \u201c [was] not a charge on property\nfor the purpose o f raising revenue. Revenue may incidentally arise therefrom, but that fact does not divest the regula\u00ad\ntion of its commerce character and render it an exercise o f the taxing power.\u201d Rodgers, 138 F.2d at 995.",

Those of the cases cited by the Corporation Counsel that held that the charge\nin question was a fee generally differ from the present case in the critical respect\nthat they involved payments to defray costs attributable to regulated parties. For\nexample, in holding that a ten dollar criminal history records check charge paid\nby potential firearms buyers was a fee, the court in In re Shooters Emporium,\nInc., 135 B.R. 701 (Bnkr. S.D. Fla. 1992), stated that\nthe nature of the payment is voluntary. Payment is required only\nif one desires to purchase a firearm. The purpose of the payment\nis for private benefit. Only people who pay the fee may purchase\na firearm. Furthermore, this payment is clearly designed to recoup\nthe costs of regulation from the people regulated, rather than to\nraise general revenues. This payment can not be reasonably con\u00ad\nstrued to be an involuntary exaction for a public purpose. Id. at 702-03.9 In contrast to these cases, the Act makes clear that the Clean Air Fee is allocated to support mass transit; it does not defray costs attributable\nto parking space owners or any other regulated parties. III. For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the Clean Air Fee is a tax. To the extent that the Fee is imposed on property owned by the United States,\nit is a \u201c tax on property of the United States\u201d and therefore beyond the authority\nof the D.C.
