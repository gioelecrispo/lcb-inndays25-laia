      "content": "Award of Attorney Fees in Administrative Adjudications\nUnder \u00a7 609 of the Federal Aviation Act\nThe Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) authorizes an award of attorney fees to prevailing parties in\nadm inistrative adjudications conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board under \u00a7 609\no f the Federal Aviation Act to review decisions of the Federal Aviation Administration There is no support in the term s of the EAJA or its legislative history for an argum ent that an\nindividual\u2019s eligibility for an award of fees\u2014 and an agency\u2019s liability\u2014 are confined to situations\nin w hich the agency whose position is at issue in the adjudication also controls its conduct; in any\ncase, agencies generally have only a lim ited power to review their adm inistrative law judges\u2019\ndecisions under the EAJA. March 23, 1982\nMEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL,\nDEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION This responds to your request for the Department\u2019s opinion whether the Equal\nAccess to Justice Act authorizes an award of attorney fees to a party which\nprevails in administrative adjudications conducted by the National Transportation\nSafety Board (NTSB) under \u00a7 609(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1429 (1976).' For reasons stated hereafter we believe it does. A second question raised in your November 17 request, relating to the source\nof funds to pay a fee award under the Act, is addressed in a separate opinion of\nthis date. I. Proceedings Under \u00a7 609(a)\nThe NTSB has jurisdiction to review on appeal orders of the Federal Aviation\nAdministration (FAA) amending, suspending, or revoking certain certificates\nissued by the Secretary of Transportation under the Federal Aviation Act. See 49\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1903(a)(9). These certificates include airman certificates issued to\npilots and other flight operators, and aircraft operating certificates issued to\nowners and operators of air carriers. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1422 and 1423. Under\n1 Your letter phrases the question som ew hat differently: it asks \u201c w hether the A ct authorizes o n e agency to m ake\nfee awards against another agency in covered adm inistrative proceedings.\" As will becom e ap p aren t, we th in k the\nq u estion so phrased is, as we understand your particular co n cern s, unnecessarily broad T h e issue o f the A c t\u2019s\napplicability in \u00a7 609 proceedings is separate from that of the F A A s authority an d responsibility to expend its funds\nto pay awards m ade under the A ct. T he latter issue is discussed in our separate opinion to you of th is date on\n\u201c Funding of A ttorney Fee Awards under the Equal A ccess to Justice A ct.\u201d 197 \u00a7 609 of that Act, an FAA action must be based upon a determination that \u201c safety\nin air commerce or air transportation and the public interest\u201d requires the action;\nin practice, its order is generally occasioned by the certificate holder\u2019s apparent\nviolation of one or more sections of the Federal Aviation Regulations, 14 C.F.R.\nRarts 1 through 199 (1981).",

While \u00a7 609 requires the FAA to advise the certificate holder of charges against\nhim, and to give him an opportunity to respond to them prior to taking any action\nto amend, suspend, or revoke his certificate, the law does not require that the\nFAA\u2019s action be preceded by any sort of formal hearing, nor does the FAA\nprovide such a hearing as matter of discretion. A certificate holder is, however,\nafforded an opportunity to appeal the FAA\u2019s action to the NTSB, a procedure\nwhich, as described below, provides for such a hearing. Section 609 describes the procedures governing appeals to the NTSB from an\nFAA order amending, suspending, or revoking a certificate, and reads in perti\u00ad\nnent part as follows: Any person whose certificate is affected by such an order of the\nAdministrator under this section may appeal the Administrator\u2019s\norder to the Board and the Board may, after notice and hearing,\namend, modify, or reverse the Administrator\u2019s order if it finds that\nsafety in air commerce or air transportation and the public interest\ndo not require affirmation of the Administrator\u2019s order. In the\nconduct of its hearings the Board shall not be bound by findings of\nfact of the Administrator. The filing of an appeal with the Board\nshall stay the effectiveness of the Administrator\u2019s order unless the\nAdministrator advises the Board that an emergency exists and\nsafety in air commerce o r air transportation requires the immedi\u00ad\nate effectiveness of his order, in which event the order shall\nremain effective and the Board shall finally dispose of the appeal\nwithin sixty days after being so advised by the Administrator. The\nperson substantially affected by the Board\u2019s order may obtain\njudicial review of said order under the provisions of section 1006\n[49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486], and the Administrator shall be made a party\nto such proceedings. Federal Aviation Act of 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-726, \u00a7 609, 72 Stat. 731, 779-80\n(1958). See 49 U .S.C . \u00a7 1429(a). Formal hearings in connection with appeals from FAA orders are conducted by\nadministrative law judges employed by the NTSB. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.23. Procedures governing these hearings are set out in 49 C.F.R. Part 821,\nw ith special rules applicable to proceedings under \u00a7 609 contained at\n\u00a7\u00a7 821.30-821.33. Under these rules, the order of the FAA from which appeal\nhas been taken is filed with the NTSB as a complaint; the allegations must be\nproven by the Administrator of the FAA in the subsequent hearing before the law\njudge. The Administrator has the burden of proving that the action taken against\n198 the certificate holder was reasonable and in accordance with NTSB precedent. Both the certificate holder and the FAA are entitled to appeal a law judge\u2019s initial\ndecision to the NTSB itself; in the absence of such an appeal, however, the law\njudge\u2019s initial decision becomes final.

The pertinent provision, to be codified as 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(1), reads as\nfollows:\n(a)(1) An agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall\naward, to a prevailing party other than the United States, fees and\nother expenses incurred by that party in connection with that\nproceeding, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that\nthe position of the agency as a party to the proceeding was\nsubstantially justified or that special circumstances make an\naward unjust.

That is, you believe that \u00a7 504(a)(1) by its terms applies\nonly to a proceeding in which the \u201c agency that conducts\u201d it is also the \u201c party to\nthe proceeding\u201d against whom the private party must prevail. We do not agree\nthat the authority conferred by \u00a7 504(a)(1) may be construed so narrowly,\nparticularly where such a construction would result in exempting from the Act\u2019s\ncoverage a class of adversary adjudications no different in their effect on private\nindividuals than other adjudications plainly covered by the terms of the Act. The terms of \u00a7 504(a)(1) admittedly do not speak directly to the situation in\nwhich the agency conducting the adversary adjudication is not also the agency\nwhose position is at issue. 3 We do not agree, however, that the language of the\nsection must be read to confine its application to situations involving a single\nagency. The use of the article \u201c the\u201d to identify the agency whose position as a\nparty to the proceeding may or may not be found to be substantially justified does\nnot, in our view, necessarily identify it as the same agency which conducts the\nadversary adjudication and employs the adjudicative officer. Finding the plain\nlanguage of \u00a7 504(a)(1) not to be conclusive, we must interpret the fee-shifting\nprovisions of \u00a7 504(a)(1) in light of other provisions of the statute, the legislative\nhistory of the Act, and Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting it. 4 The purpose of the Act, as reflected in its preamble, is \u201c to diminish the\ndeterrent effect of seeking review of or defending against, [unreasonable] gov\u00ad\nernmental action\u201d because of the expense involved. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 note. The legislative history of the A ct is replete with references to situations in which\nindividuals are forced to expend large sums to defend themselves against un\u00ad\njustified governmental action. The House Judiciary Committee noted in its report\nthat:\n[f]or many citizens, the costs of securing vindication of their\nrights and the inability to recover attorney fees preclude resort to\nthe adjudicatory process. When the cost of contesting a Govern\u00ad\nment order, for example, exceeds the amount at stake, a party has\nno realistic choice and no effective remedy. In these cases, it is\nmore practical to endure an injustice than to contest it. 3 S uch situations are, to be su re, com paratively rare in th e adm inistrative context",

This language suggests that Congress\nat the very least contemplated that a prevailing party would be entitled to an\naward from an agency other than the one actually conducting the proceeding. Our conclusion that Congress did not intend to render the Act inapplicable in\nproceedings conducted by one agency to review actions taken by another is\nreinforced, if not required, by numerous references in the legislative history to\nthe situation presented by appeals to the independent Occupational Safety and\nHealth Review Commission from citations of the Secretary of Labor under\n3 Your position appears to be prem ised on the assum ption that an agency w hich both conducts and pro secu tes an\nadm inistrative adjudication has the pow er to review (and potentially to reverse) the findings o f the \u201c adjudicative\no ffic er\" which trig g er the statute\u2019s directive to pay a fee award However, as we read the term s o f \u00a7 504(a)(1) in light\no f C ongress' purpose, they preclude review of these findings at the adm inistrative level.

The burden, once imposed, can only be lifted through that person\u2019s\nwillingness to resort to what may be lengthy and expensive administrative appeal\nand, possibly, litigation. Thus, it may be \u201c more practical to endure an injustice\nthan to contest it.\u201d House Report at 9. We can think of no reason, consistent with\nthe purpose of the Act, why the agency which imposed the burden should escape\nliability for attorney fees where its position is not substantially justified. We conclude, therefore, that proceedings under \u00a7 609 were intended by\nCongress to be covered by the Act. Thus, in the event the FAA\u2019s position is not\nfound to be substantially justified by the administrative law judge presiding over\nthe adjudication, the prevailing party is entitled to an award of fees against the\nFAA.6 We recognize that our conclusion with respect to the Act\u2019s applicability to\n\u00a7 609 proceedings may not appear to be directly responsive to your concern that\nthe Act not be interpreted \u201c to permit one agency to make a fee award against\nanother.\u201d In this regard, we would simply point out that the Act in this case does\nno more than supplement remedial authority which Congress has already con\u00ad\nferred on the NTSB to review and, if necessary, reverse FAA orders under \u00a7 609\nof the Act. In addition, whether or not an award of fees will be made under \u00a7 504(a)(1)\ndepends upon certain findings by the administrative law judge\u2014 findings which,\nunder the terms of the Act would not in any event be administratively reviewable\nby the agency conducting the proceeding. See note 5, supra. The position of the\nFAA in \u00a7 609 proceedings is in this sense no different from the position of an\nagency which both conducts and prosecutes an administrative adjudication. In\neither case, an administrative law judge acting independently is charged with\nmaking the final administrative determination. Finally, we do not believe our conclusion with respect to the applicability of\nthe Act in \u00a7 609 proceedings is inconsistent with the position set forth, taken in\ncontext, in the Deputy Attorney General\u2019s letter of May 12, 1981, to the\nAdministrative Conference of the United States.",

While we have not directly\nstudied that issue, we do not see any basis for differing with the Deputy Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s position. However, we decide only that when the FAA takes an adverse\naction under \u00a7 609, it may be subjected to payment of an award under the Equal\nAccess to Justice Act in a proceeding brought to review its action before the\nNTSB.
