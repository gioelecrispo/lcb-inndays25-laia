September 25, 1989\nM e m o r a n d u m O p in io n f o r t h e A c t in g A s s is t a n t A t t o r n e y G e n e r a l\nC iv i l D i v i s i o n This memorandum responds to your request for the opinion of this\nOffice as to whether the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d or \u201cCom\u00ad\nmission\u201d) has authority to prosecute actions for criminal contempt. We\nconclude that the Commission lacks authority to prosecute such actions,\nunless the Commission\u2019s attorneys receive special appointments from the\nAttorney General and become subject to his direction. I. A court o f the United States has the power to \u201cpunish by fine or impris\u00ad\nonment ... such contempt of its authority, and none other, as ... [disobe\u00ad\ndience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or\ncommand.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(3). Where an alleged criminal contempt arises\nfrom disobedience to a court order in a case that the Commission has\nbrought or defended, the Commission asserts \"the authority, upon\nappointment by the court, to prosecute the contempt. See Letter for\nRobert N. Ford, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, from\nAmanda B. Pederson, Deputy Director of Consumer Protection, Federal\nTrade Commission at 1 (June 24, 1985) (\u201cPederson Letter\u201d). The Civil\nDivision and the Criminal Division both take the view that the\nCommission is without authority to conduct such prosecutions. See\nLetter for Amanda B. Pederson, from Robert N. Ford (June 10, 1985);\nMemorandum for Margaret Love, Attomey-Advisor, Office of Legal\nCounsel, from Lawrence Lippe, Chief, General Litigation and Legal\nAdvice Section, Criminal Division (Oct. 28, 1985). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 516, the Attorney General, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise\nauthorized by law,\u201d has control over \u201cthe conduct o f litigation in which\n291 the United States, an agency, or officer thereof is a party, or is interested.\u201d See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 519.1The principle that the Attorney General has ple\u00ad nary authority over such litigation applies with particular force in crimi\u00ad\nnal cases. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 694 (1974) (\u201cUnder\nthe authority o f Art. II, \u00a7 2, Congress has vested in the Attorney General\nthe pow er to conduct the criminal litigation o f the United States\nGovernment.\u201d) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 516). Therefore, the Commission may\nnot bring an action for criminal contempt unless clearly \u201cauthorized by\nlaw\u201d to do so. Cf. United States v. International Union of Operating\nEng'rs, 638 F.2d 1161, 1162 (9th Cir. 1979), cert, denied, 444 U.S. 1077\n(1980) (noting \u201ca presumption against a congressional intention to limit\nthe power o f the Attorney General to prosecute offenses under the crim\u00ad\ninal laws o f the United States,\u201d in rejecting argument that United States\nmust exhaust administrative remedies before bringing criminal case).",

When the bill came from the Conference Committee, it included one\nprovision (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(m)) that the parliamentarian o f the House inter\u00ad\npreted as allowing criminal prosecutions by the Commission. See 119\nCong. Rec. 36,813 (1973) (remarks of Sen. Stevens). To clarify the provi\u00ad\nsion, the Senate returned to the version that it had originally passed,\nwhich plainly \u201capplie[d] only to civil actions.\u201d Id,.4\nNevertheless, the Commission argues that it has authority to bring\nactions for criminal contempt. The Commission does not claim any\nexpress statutory basis for this supposed authority. Instead, it contends\nthat \u201cthe authority of [its] attorneys to prosecute the criminal contempt\n(if appointed by the court to do so) is an inherent part of their authority\nto prosecute the underlying action from which the contempt arises.\u201d Pederson Letter at 1. The Commission also relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s\nopinion in FTC v. Dean Foods Co., 384 U.S. 597 (1966). In that case, the\nCourt held that the Commission, despite an absence o f explicit statutory\nauthority, could seek preliminary relief from the Court of Appeals pend\u00ad\ning the outcome of Commission proceedings in a merger case because\n\u201c[s]uch ancillary powers have always been treated as essential to the 2(.. continued)\ndesignated by it for such purpose, unless the Commission authorizes the Attorney General to\ndo so The Commission shall inform the Attorney General o f the exercise o f such authority and\nsuch exercise shall not preclude the Attorney General from intervening on behalf o f the United\nStates in such action and any appeal o f such action as may be otherwise provided by law\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 56(a) 15 U S C. \u00a7 56(a)(3), to which these sections refer, deals with representation in civil\nactions before the Supreme Court\n3 As explained below, the Commission asserts that its power to prosecute contempts is incidental to its\nstatutory power under the sections o f the United States Code referred to in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 56(b) Therefore,\nthe Commission could not escape from the provision o f 15 U.S C \u00a7 56(b) about certification to the\nAttorney General by arguing that liability for contempt is not \u201cunder [sections 41 to 46 and 47 to 58]\u201d of\ntitle 15, as referred to in that provision. 4 Although Congress substituted a new version o f 15 U.S.C \u00a7 45(m) in 1975, the amended provision\nexpressly applies only to civil actions and thus does not enlarge the scope o f the section in that respect. See Pub. L No 93-637, tit. II, \u00a7\u00a7 204(b), 205(a), 88 Stat. 2193, 2199, 2200-01 (1975). 293 effective discharge o f the Commission\u2019s responsibilities.\u201d Id. at 607.

A.\nThe Commission has no authority to prosecute a criminal contempt\nas \u201can inherent part o f [its] authority to prosecute the underlying action\nfrom which the contempt arises.\u201d Pederson Letter at 1. An action for\ncriminal contempt is separate from the underlying civil litigation. As the\nSupreme Court explained in Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton, 481\nU.S. 787 (1987), the \u201ccriminal contempt proceedings arising out o f civil\nlitigation \u2018are between the public and the defendant, and are not a part of\nthe original cause.\u2019\u201d Id. at 804 (quoting Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range\nCo., 221 U.S. 418, 445 (1911)); see Bray v. United States, 423 U.S 73, 75\n(1975). 5 Because the underlying civil action that Congress authorized the\nCommission to pursue is distinct from the criminal contempt action,\nthere is no reason to infer that Congress intended the Commission\u2019s liti\u00ad\ngation authority to reach criminal contempt cases. This conclusion is no mere matter of form but follows from the essen\u00ad\ntially different interests at stake in the underlying civil litigation and the\nsubsequent criminal prosecution. Civil actions for injunctions vindicate\nthe goals o f the Federal Trade Commission Act or the Clayton Act;\nCongress explicitly entrusted the Commission with the duty of seeking\nthose goals through litigation. An action for criminal contempt, however,\nis aimed at \u201cvindicating the authority o f the court\u201d and \u201cpresenting]\nrespect for the judicial system itself.\u201d Vuitton, 481 U.S. at 800.\u00ae Prosecution o f the criminal contempt, therefore, serves purposes different\nfrom those Congress directed the Commission to pursue in civil litigation. 7\n5 A prosecution for cnminal contempt, fo r example, is not \u201caffected by any settlement which the par\u00ad\nties to the [underlying] equity cause made in their pnvate litigation,\u201d but continues as a separate action. Gompers v Bucks Stove & Range Co , 221 U.S at 451\n6The Supreme Court accordingly held in Vuitton that attorneys \u201cappointed to prosecute a cnminal con\u00ad\ntempt action represent the United States, n ot the party that is the beneficiary o f the court order alleged\u00ad\nly violated.\" 481 U.S. at 804, see United States v. Providence Journal Co , 485 U S. 693, 700 (1988) (\u201cThe\naction was initiated in vindication of the \u2018judicial Power o f the United States' U S. C onst, Art. Ill, \u00a7 1\n(emphasis added), and it is that interest, unique to the sovereign, that continues now to be litigated in\nthis Court.\u201d). 7 To be sure, a prosecution for cnminal contempt, in som e measure, will indirectly promote the statu\u00ad\ntory policies at stake m the underlying litigation. Future violations o f orders requinng obedience to the\nstatute administered by the Commission may be deterred by the prospect o f punishment for contempt.",

Future violations o f orders requinng obedience to the\nstatute administered by the Commission may be deterred by the prospect o f punishment for contempt. But this indirect promotion o f the statutory policies does not detract from the primary purpose o f vindicatingjudicial authonty in cnminal contempt cases. It is the vindication o f judicial authonty (and not the\nCommission\u2019s authonty) that justifies appointment o f a prosecutor by the court in the first place. See\nVuitton, 481 U.S. at 800-01, Cheff v Schnackenberg, 384 U S. 373, 378 (1966) (plurality opinion) ( \u201cCheff\nwas found in contempt o f the Court of Appeals, not o f the Commission.\u201d). 294 The Commission\u2019s argument, moreover, could lead to a widening circle\nof \u201cincidental\u201d criminal prosecutions by the Commission. Charges o f per\u00ad\njury, bribery, or obstruction of justice, too, could grow out o f civil pro\u00ad\nceedings brought by the Commission. To our knowledge, however, the\nCommission has never asserted authority to prosecute such crimes, and\nexercise o f such authority would be clearly contrary to the requirement\no f the FTC Act that criminal charges be referred to the Attorney General. Actions for criminal contempt, therefore, are separate from the under\u00ad\nlying civil actions in which the orders alleged to be violated are issued. The Commission\u2019s authority to litigate the civil actions does not entail\nany \u201cinherent\u201d authority to bring actions for criminal contempt. B.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in FTC v. Dean Foods Co., 384 U.S.\n597 (1966), does not support the authority claimed by the Commission to\ninitiate actions for criminal contempt. Dean Foods merely held that the\nCommission could ask the court o f appeals for a preliminary iryunction\nagainst a merger, pending the outcome o f administrative proceedings. Although the Commission had no explicit statutory power to seek this\npreliminary relief, the Court ruled that such power could be inferred:\n[T]he Commission is a governmental agency to which\nCongress has entrusted, inter alia, the enforcement o f the\nClayton Act, granting it the power to order divestiture in\nappropriate cases. At the same time, Congress has given the\ncourts o f appeals jurisdiction to review final Commission\naction. It would stultify congressional purpose to say that\nthe Commission did not have the incidental power to ask\nthe courts of appeals to exercise their authority derived\nfrom the All Writs Act. Id. at 606 (footnote omitted). This rationale does not justify the Com\u00ad mission\u2019s prosecution o f actions for criminal contempt. An action for\ncriminal contempt does not vindicate the laws whose enforcement\n\u201cCongress has entrusted\u201d to the Commission; it vindicates the authority\nof the court, in a proceeding separate from the underlying civil action. Moreover, without authority to seek a preliminary ii\\junction, the\nCommission would be powerless to prevent illegal mergers. Thus, injunc\u00ad\ntive authority is necessary to accomplish the mission Congress has set for\nthe FTC. On the other hand even without criminal contempt authority,\nthe FTC can fully vindicate its decrees through its civil authority.",

On the other hand even without criminal contempt authority,\nthe FTC can fully vindicate its decrees through its civil authority. Accordingly, the authority to prosecute criminal contempts cannot be\nfairly inferred from the FTC\u2019s general statutory authority. Nor do we believe that the Dean Foods Court\u2019s observation, in dictum,\nthat it had never been \u201casserted that the Commission could not bring con\u00ad\ntempt actions in the appropriate court o f appeals when the court\u2019s\nenforcement orders were violated, though it has no statutory authority in\n295 this respect,\u201d 384 U.S. at 607, suggests that the Commission er\\joys the\npower to bring criminal contempt cases. The Court followed this observa\u00ad\ntion by declaring that \u201c[s]uch ancillary powers have always been treated as\nessential to the effective discharge of the Commission\u2019s responsibilities.\u201d Id. Thus, this dictum can most sensibly be read as referring to civil con\u00ad\ntempt, since the other instances o f the Commission\u2019s implied powers dis\u00ad\ncussed by the Court \u2014 the power to seek preliminary relief from an\nappellate court and the power to defend Commission orders in judicial\nreview proceedings \u2014 concern civil actions in which the Commission\u2019s\nauthority and the policies o f the statutes administered by the\nCommission would be vindicated. See id. at 606-07. Criminal contempt\ncases, as explained above, vindicate instead the authority o f the court, in\nproceedings separate from the underlying civil actions. Furthermore, the Eighth Circuit has reached the conclusion that Dean\nFoods \u201cdid not directly or indirectly concern itself with the possible con\u00ad\nflict between the Commission and the Attorney General over which\nagency was the proper one to seek the exercise\u201d o f the appellate court\u2019s\npower to issue a preliminary injunction. FTC v. Guignon, 390 F.2d 323,\n327 (8th Cir. 1968). The issue in Guignon was whether the Commission,\non its own behalf, could seek to enforce discovery subpoenas or needed\nthe \u201caid or consent\u201d o f the Attorney General. Id. at 324. The court decid\u00ad\ned that the Commission could not seek, on its own behalf, to enforce its\ndiscovery subpoenas but depended on the Attorney General to do so. Whether or not the court in Guignon was correct in making this ruling,8\nor in interpreting Dean Foods as not involving possible conflicts between\nthe Commission and the Attorney General, Guignon demonstrates that\nDean Foods should not be read as a general warrant for the Commission\nto assert implied powers that conflict with the Attorney General\u2019s statu\u00ad\ntory authority. C.\nThe Commission also argues that its authority to prosecute criminal\ncontempts \u201cis supported both by long and consistent usage and by the\nonly decision o f which [the Commission is] aware in which the issue [of\nagency authority] was expressly contested and resolved.\u201d Pederson\nLetter at 1.

In any event, we do not believe that the usage or the case pro\u00ad\nvides support for the Commission\u2019s claim o f authority to bring criminal\ncontempt actions. As to the usage, the Commission cites seven reported cases in which it\n8 Two district court cases decided at approximately the same time as Guignon held that the\nCommission could seek to enforce its subpoenas without the consent and assistance o f the Attorney\nGeneral FTC v. Kujawski, 298 F. Supp. 1288, 1289 (N D. G a 1969); FTC v. Continental Can Co , 267 F.\nSupp. 713 (S.D.N.Y. 1967) Through later legislation, Congress made clear the Commission\u2019s statutory\nauthonty to bring actions to enforce subpoenas. See 15 U S.C \u00a7 56(a)(2)(D), Pub L. No. 93-153, tit. IV, \u00a7\n408(g), 87 Stat 576, 592 (1973); Pub. L. No. 93-637, tit.

Nor did the Ninth Circuit consider the\nissue of statutory authority in a more recent case in which it sustained a\nfinding of contempt and rejected the argument that, under Vuitton, the\nCommission was disqualified from prosecuting the contempt because it\nwas an interested party. 10 See FTC v. American Nat\u2019l Cellular, 868 F.2d\n315 (9th Cir. 1989). Because these cases do not discuss the issue of statu\u00ad\ntory authority, they do not illuminate whether Congress intended the\nCommission to prosecute criminal contempts. See United States v.\nMorton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 647 (1950) (Nonexistent powers cannot \u201cbe\nprescripted by an unchallenged exercise.\u201d). Nor has the usage in this area been consistent. In one instance of which\nwe have been made aware, the Commission\u2019s lawyers received appoint\u00ad\nments as Special Assistant United States Attorneys, when a grand jury was\nconducting an investigation bearing on possible charges of criminal con\u00ad\ntempt.

The Commission suggests that this involvement\nby the Department o f Justice does not destroy the consistency o f the\nCommission\u2019s practice o f representing itself because the Commission\u2019s\nattorneys \u201cmight properly prosecute the particular matter themselves.\u201d Pederson Letter at 3 n.3. That argument, however, is circular; it assumes\nthat the Commission\u2019s lawyers could have brought an action. Absent the\nassumption that the Commission may prosecute a criminal contempt\naction, the involvement o f the Department o f Justice undermines the con\u00ad\nsistency of the very usage on which the Commission relies.",

Absent the\nassumption that the Commission may prosecute a criminal contempt\naction, the involvement o f the Department o f Justice undermines the con\u00ad\nsistency of the very usage on which the Commission relies. The Commission also argues that one case, SEC v. Murphy, Fed. Sec. L.\nRep. (CCH) 99,688 (C.D. Cal. 1983), explicitly considered and upheld the\nauthority of the Securities and Exchange Commission to bring criminal\ncontempt actions under a statute similar to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 56. The Court in\nMurphy did not discuss the different interests to be vindicated in criminal\ncontempt action and the underlying civil case. Instead, the court based its\nholding on the absence o f an explicit statutory prohibition against the 9FTC v. Hoboken White Lead & Color Works, 67 F.2d 551 (2d Cir. 1933); FTC v. Pacific States Paper\nTrade Ass\u2019n, 88 F.2d 1009 (9th Cir 1937), In re Dolan Co7p., 247 F2d 524 (D C. Cir. 1956), cert denied,\n353 U.S. 988 (1957), In re P. LoriUard Co , 1959 Trade Cas (CCH) H 69,272 (4th Cir 1959); In re\nFloersheim, 316 F.2d 423 (9th Cir. 1963), In re Holland Furnace Co., 341 F.2d 548 (7th Cir. 1965), affd\nsub nom Cheff v Schnackenberg, 384 U S. 373 (1966); In re Whitney & Co., 273 F.2d 211 (9th Cir 1959). 10Vuitton held, under the Court\u2019s supervisory power, that counsel for an interested party in civil litiga\u00ad\ntion underlying a contempt action should not be appointed to prosecute the contempt. See 481 U.S. at\n802-09. 297 SEC\u2019s bringing the action and on the argument that \u201cthe SEC \u2014 not the\nUnited States Attorney, the Attorney General, or anyone else \u2014 is in the\nbest position to know the specific prohibitions o f the injunction and the\nparticular circumstances which allegedly constitute the contempt of the\ninjunction.\u201d Id. at 97,765. In Vuitton, however, the Court rejected the argu\u00ad\nment that an attorney\u2019s expertise justifies giving him control of a prosecu\u00ad\ntion for criminal appointment. The Court held that, despite expert knowl\u00ad\nedge, counsel for an interested private party should not be allowed to\nprosecute a criminal contempt: \u201cThat familiarity may be put to use in\nassisting a disinterested prosecutor in pursuant to the contempt action,\nbut cannot justify permitting counsel for the private party to be in control\no f the prosecution.\u201d Vuitton, 481 U.S. at 806 n.17. Similarly, the\nCommission\u2019s knowledge of the underlying action cannot justify abandon\u00ad\ning the principle that the Attorney General is to control the litigation of\ncriminal cases on behalf of the United States. See United States v. Nixon,\n418 U.S. at 694; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 516. The single district court case addressing\nthis issue \u2014 decided before Vuitton \u2014 is, therefore, unpersuasive. In sum, the cases and practices on which the Commission relies do not\nestablish that the Commission has implied authority to bring actions for\ncriminal contempt.",

In sum, the cases and practices on which the Commission relies do not\nestablish that the Commission has implied authority to bring actions for\ncriminal contempt. The cases involving the Commission itself do not\ntouch on the issue at all; the usage in this area is not consistent; and the\nsingle district court case that might lead to an argument by analogy has\nbeen undercut by the later opinion o f the Supreme Court in Vuitton. III. Finally, we address two arguments not advanced in the Pederson\nLetter. First, although the Pederson Letter cites Fed. R. Crim. P. criminal\ncontempt actions, the Commission does not rely on Rule 42(b) as \u201cauthoriz[ing] by law\u201d the Commission\u2019s initiation of actions for criminal con\u00ad\ntempt. Since the Pederson Letter, Vuitton has established that Rule 42(b)\n\u201cdoes not provide authorization for the appointment o f a private attor\u00ad\nney\u201d but \u201cspeaks only to the procedure for providing notice of criminal\ncontempt.\u201d Vuitton, 481 U.S. at 793, 794 (emphasis omitted). Rule 42(b)\nthus offers no authority for the Commission to prosecute contempts. Second, it might be argued that even if the Commission lacks statutory\nauthority to bring actions for criminal contempt, a court, through the\nexercise o f its authority to appoint prosecutors, could empower the\nCommission to prosecute a criminal contempt case. Any such argument\nwould be groundless. In addition to the issue o f the court\u2019s authority to\nappoint prosecutors, there is a separate question about whether the\ngovernment attorneys have authority to accept appointment. The Com\u00ad\nmission is a creation of statute and thus must abide by the statutory lim\u00ad\nitations on the authority. See Civil Aeronautics Bd. v. Delta Air Lines,\n367 U.S. 316, 322 (1961); Oceanair of Florida v. United States Dep\u2019t of\n298 Transp., 876 F.2d 1560, 1565 (11th Cir. 1989). Prosecution o f criminal\ncontempts by Commission attorneys at the behest o f a court would\ncircumvent the Congressional determination to limit the Commission\u2019s\nauthority to civil actions. 11 IV. We conclude that the Commission has no authority to bring actions for\ncriminal contempt. Commission lawyers, however, may be appointed\nspecial attorneys subject to the Attorney General\u2019s direction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n515, and in that capacity could conduct prosecutions for criminal con\u00ad\ntempt in cases where the court had appointed the United States Attorney\nto prosecute. WILLIAM P. BARR\nAssistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel 11 We do not believe that the judiciary would have the constitutional authonty to assign governmental\nattorneys to prosecute cnminal contempts in contravention o f limits on their statutory authonty Vuitton\nsustained the appointment o f pnvate attorneys to prosecute cnminal contempts, because a court\u2019s power\nto \u201cpunish disobedience to judicial orders is regarded as essential to ensuring that the Judiciary has a\nmeans to vindicate its own authonty without complete dependence on other Branches \u201d Vuitton, 481\nU S at 796 Although the power o f courts to vindicate their own authority, under the circumstances in\nVuitton, arguably may be grounded in the Constitution, appointment o f Commission attorneys hardly\npromotes judicial freedom from \u201ccomplete dependence on other Branches.\u201d 299",
