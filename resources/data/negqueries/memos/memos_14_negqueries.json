      "content": "The General Counsel to the United States Trade Representative has\nsince expressed his opinion in a memorandum (hereinafter Memoran\u00ad\ndum) that the effect of certain of these statutes is to preclude the\nimposition of export controls under the EAA. We disagree with this\nreading of the statutes; and for the reasons that follow, we conclude\nthat the President\u2019s authority under the EA A is not so limited. In his Memorandum, the General Counsel states his view that certain\nstatutes currently controlling the products as to which export controls\nare being considered contain \u201cexpress provisions\u201d permitting exports of\nthe products. 1 The General Counsel therefore concludes that export\n\u2022 N o t e : T h e text o f the A pril 11, 1980, m em orandum appears in this volum e at p. 568.

The\ninconsistency is asserted on the basis of \u00a7 17(a) of the EAA which\nprovides that \u201c[n]othing contained in this Act. . . . shall be construed\nto modify, repeal, supersede, or otherwise affect the provisions of any\nother laws authorizing control over exports of any commodity.\u201d 50\nU.S.C. App. \u00a7 2416(a). By this section, the General Counsel finds that\nCongress has expressly excluded from controls under the EAA any\ncommodity the export of which is provided for under any other law,\nincluding the seven specific statutes cited. And, in the face of the\nasserted congressional prohibition of export controls, he concludes that\nthe Executive has no authority to regulate foreign commerce. We have\nexamined the General Counsel\u2019s Memorandum and in our opinion none\nof its conclusions is correct. I. A.\nThe General Counsel\u2019s Memorandum rests, at bottom, on the\nview that each of the seven statutes cited expressly authorizes export of\nthe regulated products. We find no such express authorization. The so-called export authorization cited under the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 381(d)(1), provides that a food,\ndrug, device, or cosmetic intended for export shall not be deemed to be\nadulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the law if it meets\ncertain conditions for export including specification by a foreign pur\u00ad\nchaser, compliance with the laws of the importing country, and appro\u00ad\npriate labeling. Section 381(d)(1) is thus not an express authorization of\nexports at all. It is nothing more than an exemption for exports from\nthe regulatory scheme and the standards required for products intended\nfor use in this country. With minor differences in the requirements that must be met before\nthe exemption from domestic standards will be available, the other cited\nprovisions are to the same effect.

In the absence of any express authorization for exports under these\nstatutes, the further argument in the Memorandum as to the effect of\n\u00a7 17(a) of the EAA has not even the basis asserted therein. The con\u00ad\ntinuing relevance of other laws providing for export, as \u00a7 17(a) is said\nto recognize, depends first on a finding that other laws in fact provide,\nin so many words, for export. We have concluded that the cited\nstatutes do not. But even if they did, the effect of \u00a7 17(a) would not be\nto preclude controls under the EAA. The assertion in the Memoran\u00ad\ndum to the contrary greatly distorts the language of \u00a7 17(a). First, \u00a7 17(a) does not address, as the Memorandum asserts, the rela\u00ad\ntionship between the EAA and other laws that provide for export.",

Instead, it expressly recognizes the\neffect of other controls. C. With this statutory construction, the constitutional argument in\nthe Memorandum also falls. The assertion that the Executive may\nregulate commerce only as Congress has. provided, and thus may not\ntake actions that Congress has expressly forbidden, is meaningless in the\ncontext of the EAA, which not only does not forbid the export con\u00ad\ntrols contemplated here but in fact expressly authorizes them. 4\nII. There are other significant reasons for our opinion that the regula\u00ad\ntory scheme of the seven cited statutes does not preclude export con\u00ad\ntrols for foreign policy purposes under the EAA. The argument to the\ncontrary ignores the history of \u00a7 17(a), fails to take account of the\neffect of the argument on national security and short-supply controls,\nand represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose and\nfunction of the EAA. A. The provision that is now \u00a7 17(a) derives from \u00a7 10 of the Export\nControl Act of 1949, which provided:\nThe Act of February 15, 1936 (49 Stat. 1140), relating to\nthe licensing of exports of tinplate scrap, is hereby super\u00ad\nseded; but nothing contained in this Act shall be con\u00ad\nstrued to modify, repeal, supersede, or otherwise affect\nthe provisions of any other laws authorizing control over\nexports of any commodity. Pub. L. No. 81-11, \u00a7 10, 63 Stat. 7, 9 (1949). The legislative history of\n\u00a7 10 makes clear both the reason for the change in the law relating to\ntinplate scrap and the fact that no other changes in existing export\ncontrol laws were made. Under prior law, the export licensing author\u00ad\nity for tinplate scrap was conferred upon the Department of State but\nwas, in practice, handled by the Department of Commerce. Section 10\nhad the effect of transferring the licensing authority to the agency that\nwould administer the 1949 Act and also conforming the law to the\nprior practice. S. Rep. No. 31, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1949). Yet there\n4\nW e d o not wish to be understood as conceding, how ever, that the E xecutive has no independent\nconstitutional au th o rity to regulate com m erce for foreign policy reasons. Because the E A A clearly\nconfers this authority by statute, we have no need to consider the constitutional question. 805 were in effect at the time of the 1949 Act export controls on other\ncommodities, such as narcotics, gold, ammunition, arms, implements of\nwar, tobacco seed, and atomic energy materials, H.R. Rep. No. 18, 81st\nCong., 1st Sess. 12 (1949); the Senate report, supra, mentions helium\nalso. As to these, \u201cthe bill makes no change whatever in the present\nlaws.\u201d S. Rep. No. 31, supra; see also H.R. Rep. No. 18, supra. The Export Administration Act of 1969, Pub. L. No. 91-184, \u00a7 12(a),\n83 Stat. 841, 846 (1969), retained verbatim the language of \u00a7 10.",

L. No. 91-184, \u00a7 12(a),\n83 Stat. 841, 846 (1969), retained verbatim the language of \u00a7 10. The\n1979 Act deleted the language expressly superseding the prior law as to\ntinplate scrap but retained the language continuing the effectiveness of\nother laws authorizing control over exports. There is no explanation in\nthe legislative history why the 1969 Act carried over the reference to\ntinplate scrap or why the 1979 Act deleted it, but the process is in any\nevent not relevant to the issue here. What is important is that the 1979\nAct retained in \u00a7 17(a) that portion of the prior provisions clearly\nstating the legislative intent that the EAA did not replace the regula\u00ad\ntory authority existing pursuant to other laws. By its literal terms, \u00a7 17(a) goes no further. As we noted above in\ndiscussing the construction given to \u00a7 17(a) in the Memorandum, the\nsection does not address the effect, if any, of this other regulatory\nauthority on the authority under the EAA. But in preserving the\nauthority to impose controls pursuant to other laws, \u00a7 17(a), like its\npredecessors, creates a regulatory structure in which export controls\nunder these other laws exist side by side with controls under the EAA. At least in the absence of any indication to the contrary in these other\nstatutes, the reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the history of\n\u00a7 17(a), and the logical implication of the regulatory structure that\nresults, is that controls under the EA A also may exist side by side with\nthese other controls. As we discuss at length above, we find no such\ncontrary indication in any of the seven statutes cited. The Memorandum is addressed only to export controls imposed for\nforeign policy purposes. But the EAA also provides authority to\nimpose controls in the interests of national security, or to prevent\nundue diminution of goods in short supply, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 2404,\n2406. The authority as to national security controls is conferred in\nfurtherance of the congressionally declared policy of using export con\u00ad\ntrols \u201cto restrict the export of goods and technology which would\nmake a significant contribution to the military potential of any other\ncountry or combination of countries which would prove detrimental to\nthe national security of the United States.\u201d 50 U.S.C. App.\n\u00a7 2402(2)(A). As to short-supply controls, the export control authority\nis intended to implement the policy of using export controls \u201cto protect\nthe domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce materials and\nto reduce the serious inflationary impact of foreign demand.\u201d 50 U.S.C.\nApp. \u00a7 2402(2)(C). 806 B. The Memorandum does not discuss the effect of \u00a7 17(a) on these\nnational security or short-supply controls, but there is nothing in \u00a7 17(a)\nthat would limit to foreign policy controls the effect attributed to that\nprovision in the Memorandum. Under that interpretation, national secu\u00ad\nrity, controls would be precluded merely because another statute im\u00ad\nposed health and safety regulations on domestic distribution of a par\u00ad\nticular product but utilized a more lenient standard for exports.",

For this\nis all that the seven cited provisions do; and this, of course, protects the\nnational security not at all. A health-and-safety regulatory scheme that\nincluded different standards for domestic distribution and export would\nsimilarly preclude short-supply export controls even though the other\nstatute protected the national economy not at all. This interpretation of\n\u00a7 17(a) cannot be squared with the clear legislative intent as expressed\nin the congressional declarations of policy. 5\nC. In the final analysis, this result is the clearest indication that the\nview in the Memorandum must be rejected. In pursuit of national\nsecurity, foreign policy, and economic stability, the EAA was intended\nto provide comprehensive authority for the control of exports. Nothing\nless would meet the stated goals of increasing the emphasis on national\nsecurity, 1979 Senate Report at 4, and implementing \u201cthe full range of\nU.S. foreign policy goals,\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 482, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 43\n(1979) (1979 Conference Report) while at the same time minimizing\nuncertainty in export policy, increasing the efficiency of applicable\nadministrative procedures, obtaining increased cooperation by our\nallies, and providing the Executive with the flexibility to react\npromptly and appropriately to extreme and varied situations. See 1979\nSenate Report at 2-3, 8; 1979 House Report at 4-5; 1979 Conference\nReport at 43. Insulating a vast range of products from export controls\nwould in one stroke defeat these goals and prevent any kind of a\ncomprehensive and consistent export policy. And, as increased concern\nabout health and safety requires expanded domestic regulation of haz\u00ad\nardous substances, this approach would force the Executive to choose,\non the one hand, between forgoing domestic .regulation (or seeking in\nthe course of such regulation export standards identical in all circum\u00ad\nstances to domestic standards) or, on the other hand, retaining the\nauthority to control exports as appropriate under the EAA. We cannot\nbelieve that Congress intended to force such a choice. The legislative\nhistory and the statements of findings and policy in the EAA are at\nodds with this interpretation and indicate instead that, where export\n5\nO ne additional indication that these health-and-safety regulations do not preclude the imposition\no f export controls under the E A A is the inclusion o f \u00a7 6 (0 o f the A ct, w hich provides that the EA A\ndoes not authorize controls on medicine o r medical supplies, 50 U.S.C.
