As we explain more fully below, we believe\nthat section 235A requires the Attorney General to establish and maintain certain\npreinspection stations provided the foreign countries concerned have consented\nto the establishment of such stations on their territory and provided that certain\nother preconditions have been satisfied. Section 235A does not, however, oblige\nthe Attorney General or any other executive branch official to enter into diplo\u00ad\nmatic negotiations with foreign countries in order to obtain that consent, and it\ndoes not require that preinspection stations be established before the preconditions\nhave been satisfied. BACKGROUND\nSection 235A was added to the INA by section 123 of the Illegal Immigration\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104\u2014208, 110\nStat. 3009\u2014546, 3009-560 ( \u201c IIRIRA\u201d ). It mandates the establishment of immigra\u00ad\ntion \u201c preinspection\u201d stations at certain foreign airports. 1 Prior to the passage of\nsection 235A, the INA authorized, but did not require, the establishment of\npreinspection stations, and the relevant statutory provisions were neither modified\n1 \u201c Preinspection\u201d generally refers to immigration inspection procedures conducted at foreign ports of embarkation\nby United States authorities for passengers seeking entry into the United States In some instances, immigration\npreinspection is accompanied by U S.

The working group ultimately identified sixteen\npotential sites (in fifteen countries) for preinspection stations that met the criteria\nset forth in section 235A.4 The Commissioner of the INS sent a letter to the\nDepartment of State requesting that it ascertain, inter alia , whether countries con\u00ad\ntaining the sites identified by the working group were willing to allow\npreinspection stations on their territory.

INS, Re- Preinspection Working\nGroup at 5 -6 (July 22, 1997). 278 Section 235A o f the Immigration and Nationality Act American embassies and consulates in the relevant countries to explore that issue\nwith host country officials. In a letter dated January 20, 1998, the Assistant Sec\u00ad\nretary of State for Consular Affairs reported that \u201c only one [country] (Jamaica)\ngave preliminary indication that it would support establishment of an INS\npreinspection station.\u201d Letter for Hon. Doris Meissner, Commissioner, INS, from\nMary A. Ryan, Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, Dept, of State at 2 (Jan.\n20, 1998) (\u201c Ryan Letter\u201d ).5 To date, no preinspection stations have been estab\u00ad\nlished pursuant to section 235A. DISCUSSION To determine whether section 235A unconstitutionally intrudes on the Presi\u00ad\ndent\u2019s authority to conduct foreign relations, we begin by identifying section\n235A\u2019s precise requirements. For present purposes, this involves interpreting sec\u00ad\ntions 235A(a)(l), (4), and (5). The first two provisions stipulate how many\npreinspection stations are to be established and maintained, the criteria those sta\u00ad\ntions must meet, and the dates by which they are to be established. The third\nspecifies certain conditions that must be met before a preinspection station is\nestablished. Sections 235A(a)(l) and (4) both direct the Attorney General, in consultation\nwith the Secretary of State, to \u201c establish\u201d (and, in the case of section 235A(a)(l),\n\u201c maintain\u201d ) preinspection stations meeting certain criteria. Section 235A(a)(l)\nprovides that, by Octobcr 31, 1998, the Attorney General \u201c shall establish and\nmaintain preinspection stations in at least 5 of the foreign airports that are among\nthe 10 foreign airports which the Attorney General identifies as serving as last\npoints of departure for the greatest numbers of inadmissible alien passengers who\narrive from abroad by air at ports of entry within the United States.\u201d Id. Section\n235A(a)(4) provides that, by October 31, 2000, she \u201c shall establish preinspection\nstations in at least 5 additional foreign airports which the Attorney General, in\nconsultation with the Secretary of State, determines, based on the data compiled\nunder paragraph (3) and such other information as may be available, would most\neffectively reduce the number of aliens who arrive from abroad by air at points\nof entry within the United States who are inadmissible to the United States.\u201d Id. Sections 235A(a)(l) and (4) thus appear to contemplate a two-step process. First, the Attorney General is to identify potential sites for preinspection stations\nthat meet the criteria set out in the relevant section. Second, she is to establish\nsuch stations at a minimum number of sites by the dates prescribed. 5 The Ryan Letter noted that \u201c [o]ne country (Dominican Republic) indicated it might be willing to allow a\npreinspection staiion, but only if full preclearance was allowed, i.e customs inspections as w ell.\u201d Ryan Letter at\n2 The Ryan Letter further explained that fourteen countries were \u201c queried \u201d Id at 2.",

Thus, sections 235A(a)(l) and (4), including the deadlines they prescribe, are\n\u201c governed or affected by\u201d the conditions set out in section 235A(a)(5).6 Once\nthe Attorney General identifies a potential site for a preinspection station, the\nrequirement that it be \u201c established\u201d by a particular date does not take effect until\nthe Attorney General is able to ensure that the site meets section 235A(a)(5)\u2019s\nconditions. Section 235A does not specify precisely how the Attorney General is to ensure\nthat the sites she selects for preinspection stations meet section 235A(a)(5)\u2019s\nconditions or how she is to go about establishing and maintaining such stations\nonce they meet those conditions. Because the preinspection stations are to be\nlocated in foreign countries, establishing those stations is not entirely within the\ncontrol of the Attorney General or, indeed, the executive branch as a whole. Rather, preinspection stations can only be established after the United States\nobtains the consent of the foreign countries concerned. See, e.g., U.S.-Canada\nAgreement, supra.1 For two reasons, we do not read section 235A as requiring the executive branch\nto seek or obtain such consent. First, such a reading would impose on the execu\u00ad\ntive branch the obligation to achieve outcomes beyond its control. While the\nExecutive may negotiate with foreign sovereigns in an effort to obtain their con\u00ad\nsent to the establishment of preinspection stations within their territory, it is not\nwithin the Executive\u2019s power to ensure that such consent is actually given. Simi\u00ad\nlarly, the Attorney General\u2019s ability to ensure that section 235A(a)(5)\u2019s conditions\nare met depends at least in part on the cooperation of the relevant foreign govern\u00ad\nment, cooperation that she cannot guarantee. Providing \u201c appropriate protection\u201d\nto federal employees working at preinspection stations, protecting those employees\nand their families from \u201c unreasonable risks to their welfare and safety,\u201d and\nensuring that aliens in a foreign country receive appropriate \u201c protection from\nreturn to persecution\u2019 \u2019 are all undertakings that require the cooperation and partici\u00ad\npation of the foreign sovereign concerned.

Accordingly, we do not read section\n235A as requiring the executive branch to obtain either foreign countries\u2019 consent\nto the establishment of preinspection stations or their cooperation in ensuring that\nsection 235A(a)(5)\u2019s conditions are met with respect to those stations. Second, we do not read section 235A to require the Executive to enter into\ndiplomatic negotiations to obtain foreign countries\u2019 consent to the establishment\nof preinspection stations, because such a requirement would unconstitutionally\ninfringe on the President\u2019s foreign affairs power. The Constitution commits to\nthe President the responsibility for conducting the nation\u2019s foreign affairs. 8 That\nresponsibility includes the \u2018\u2018 \u2018exclusive authority to determine the time, scope, and\nobjectives\u2019 \u201d of all international negotiations.

If section 235A were\nconstrued to require the Executive to negotiate with foreign countries in an attempt\nto obtain their consent to the establishment of preinspection stations, it would\nunconstitutionally intrude on that exclusive authority.

Before any such station is established, she\nis also required to ensure that the conditions prescribed in section 235A(a)(5) are\nsatisfied. A condition precedent both to the satisfaction of section 235A(a)(5)\u2019s\nconditions and to the actual establishment of any preinspection station is that the\nforeign government concerned agree to the establishment of the station.",
