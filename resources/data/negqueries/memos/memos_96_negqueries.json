Security Council Resolution 1441. December 7, 2002 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE COUNSEL TO THE VICE PRESIDENT * You have asked whether the Government of Iraq will have committed a \u201cfurther material breach\u201d of its international legal obligations, as that term is defined\nin paragraph 4 of United Nations (\u201cU.N.\u201d) Security Council Resolution 1441\n(\u201cUNSCR 1441\u201d), if it makes false statements or omissions in the declaration\nrequired by paragraph 3 of that resolution. 1 In paragraph 3, the Security Council\nrequired that Iraq report on all aspects of its weapons of mass destruction\n(\u201cWMD\u201d) programs. Paragraph 4 finds that false statements or omissions in Iraq\u2019s\nparagraph 3 declaration and failure by Iraq to comply and cooperate with UNSCR\n1441 would constitute a further material breach. We conclude that false statements\nor omissions by themselves represent a material breach of the Security Council\nresolution. We have addressed the meaning of U.N.

Id. at 158-61. 2\nI.\nUNSCR 1441 reaffirms that the Government of Iraq is already \u201cin material\nbreach of its obligations under relevant resolutions.\u201d S.C. Res. 1441, \u00b6 1. It also\nimposes additional obligations on Iraq in order to provide it with \u201ca final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions of the\nCouncil.\u201d Id. \u00b6 2. Paragraph 3 of UNSCR 1441 requires Iraq to provide a new\ndeclaration disclosing all aspects of its WMD program within 30 days of its\nenactment. As the U.N. Security Council approved UNSCR 1441 on November 8,\n2002, the Iraqi declaration of its WMD program is due by December 8, 2002. Specifically, paragraph 3 requires Iraq to provide to the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, the International Atomic Energy\nAgency, and the Security Council a \u201ccurrently accurate, full, and complete\ndeclaration of all aspects of its\u201d WMD program.

Id. \u00b6 4 (emphasis added). Because of its use of the word \u201cand,\u201d paragraph 4 might be misconstrued by\nsome to provide that a \u201cfurther material breach\u201d has occurred only when Iraq both\nmakes false statements or omissions and fails to comply and cooperate with the\nresolution. Under such an interpretation, the word \u201cand\u201d conveys only a conjunctive meaning. Therefore, false statements or omissions in Iraq\u2019s paragraph 3\ndeclaration alone would not in itself constitute a further material breach.

II. In this context, an interpretation of \u201cand\u201d as solely conjunctive is illogical and\ninconsistent with the text and purpose of UNSCR 1441. It is well established that\nthe word \u201cand\u201d is capable of more than one possible construction. In some\ncontexts, \u201cand\u201d conveys a conjunctive meaning, under which all enumerated\nconditions must be satisfied before a particular result is achieved. In other\ncontexts, however, \u201cand\u201d is used disjunctively, in which case any one of among\ntwo or more conditions by itself would be sufficient to trigger a particular result.",

Whether the word \u201cand\u201d conveys a conjunctive or disjunctive meaning depends on\nthe context. In this case, examination of the context of UNSCR 1441 demonstrates\nclearly that paragraph 4 uses \u201cand\u201d in the disjunctive sense. Making false statements or omissions in Iraq\u2019s declaration of its WMD programs, without more,\nwould constitute a further material breach of Iraq\u2019s international obligations. A.\nUnder standard approaches to legal interpretation, it has been long established\nthat the word \u201cand\u201d may convey a disjunctive rather than a conjunctive meaning. 3 Determining which usage was intended in a particular provision requires, as\nalways, an examination of the context in which the term appears. As the Supreme\nCourt has explained, in order to give effect to the intention of those who drafted a\ntext, \u201ccourts are often compelled to construe \u2018or\u2019 as meaning \u2018and,\u2019 and again\n\u2018and\u2019 as meaning \u2018or.\u2019\u201d United States v. Fisk, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 445, 447 (1865). See also Union Ins. Co. v. United States, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 759, 764 (1867) (\u201cwhen\nwe look beyond the mere words to the obvious intent we cannot help seeing that\nthe word \u2018or\u2019 must be taken conjunctively\u201d). Such constructions are permitted to\neffectuate \u201c[t]he obvious purpose\u201d of the provision, and are appropriate when\n\u201c[t]he evil intended to be remedied\u201d is \u201ctransparent.\u201d Fisk, 70 U.S. at 447. While\npleading for reading \u201cand\u201d in its common conjunctive meaning, the most recent\nedition of Sutherland\u2019s treatise on statutory construction recognizes that\n\u201c[d]isjunctive \u2018or\u2019 and [c]onjunctive \u2018and\u2019 may be interpreted as substitutes.\u201d 3 Some might object that United States cases on the disjunctive meaning of \u201cand\u201d are not applicable\nto international law. The ordinary meaning of words, purpose, and context are relevant in international\nlegal interpretation, just as they are in American practice. As the Restatement (Third) of Foreign\nRelations Law explains, \u201can international agreement is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance\nwith the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and\npurpose.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law 325(1) (1987). See also Vienna Convention\non the Law of Treaties, art. 31(1) (same). The reasoning of American courts in interpreting \u201cand\u201d is\ntherefore relevant and persuasive with regard to how \u201cand\u201d should be read in light of its context. 219 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 229 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26 1A Norman J.

Security Council. Indeed, in a press\nrelease announcing its unanimous approval of UNSCR 1441, the Security Council\nstated that \u201c[a]ny false statement or omission in the declaration will be considered\na further material breach of Iraq\u2019s obligations.\u201d UNSCR 1441 Press Release, supra\nnote 1. In light of \u201c[t]he obvious purpose\u201d of paragraph 4, Fisk, 70 U.S. at 447, we\nwould likewise read the term \u201cand\u201d disjunctively and conclude that Iraq will be in\n\u201cfurther material breach of [its] obligations\u201d if it makes \u201cfalse statements or\nomissions in the declarations submitted . . . pursuant to [paragraph 3 of] this\nresolution.\u201d S.C.

Under a conjunctive reading of \u201cand,\u201d Iraq\ncould make a full disclosure of its existing WMD programs, and then refuse to\ndisarm and instead re-double its illegal efforts to obtain such weapons and yet still\nnot be in \u201cfurther material breach of [its] obligations\u201d to the Security Council. Or a\nmaterial breach would not occur if Iraq fully cooperated with U.N. inspectors, but\nutterly failed to provide any disclosure of information related to its WMD\nprograms. Such a result cannot be squared with the text of UNSCR 1441. Paragraph 5 and\nsubsequent provisions of UNSCR 1441 detail Iraq\u2019s specific obligations with\nrespect to inspections and disarmament. Iraqi violations of these provisions, such\nas refusing to allow inspectors into Iraq, or harming inspectors, or concealing\nWMD locations and materials, would constitute a material breach of its obligations under UNSCR 1441. Yet, under the conjunctive construction, the most\nwillful violations of its inspection obligations would not constitute a \u201cfurther\nmaterial breach\u201d so long as Iraq has not made false statements or omissions in its\nparagraph 3 declaration. Under the conjunctive approach, once Iraq satisfied its\ndeclaration obligations under paragraph 3 and refrained from making \u201cfalse\nstatements or omissions\u201d in that declaration, Iraq would never be vulnerable to a\nfinding of \u201cfurther material breach of Iraq\u2019s obligations.\u201d Such a construction of 221 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 231 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26 the resolution would render most of UNSCR 1441 a nullity.

Reading \u201cand\u201d to be conjunctive would also conflict with the very purpose of\nUNSCR 1441. The text of the resolution makes clear that its fundamental purpose\nis to disarm Iraq of WMD. Honest declarations and full and complete access for\ninspectors are merely a means required to meet an end. UNSCR 1441 expressly\nstates that, although Iraq already \u201chas been and remains in material breach of its\nobligations\u201d under prior U.N.

The resolution specifically notes that the\ndeclaration requirements of paragraph 3 are not an end in themselves, but that they\nare imposed so that Iraq might \u201cbegin to comply with its disarmament obligations.\u201d Id. \u00b6 3. Paragraph 3\u2019s mandate of a \u201ccurrently accurate, full, and complete\ndeclaration\u201d is the \u201cbegin[ning],\u201d and thus the sina qua non, of disarmament. Id.\n\u00b6\u00b6 3-4. In light of the resolution\u2019s clear purpose to achieve the disarmament of\nIraq, a construction of paragraph 4 that allows Iraq to refuse to disarm and still\navoid a finding of \u201cfurther material breach\u201d would be at odds with the text and\nstructure of UNSCR 1441.",

In light of the resolution\u2019s clear purpose to achieve the disarmament of\nIraq, a construction of paragraph 4 that allows Iraq to refuse to disarm and still\navoid a finding of \u201cfurther material breach\u201d would be at odds with the text and\nstructure of UNSCR 1441. Events surrounding the passage of UNSCR 1441 further demonstrate that the\ncore purpose of the resolution is to secure Iraqi disarmament. On October 25,\n2002, President Bush made clear that the United States would not accept any\nSecurity Council resolution that did not make disarmament its paramount objective. He stated that \u201cany resolution that evolves must be one which does the job of\nholding Saddam Hussein to account. That includes a rigorous, new and vibrant\ninspections regime, the purpose of which is disarmament, not inspections for the\nsake of inspections.\u201d 11 After the Council approved UNSCR 1441, President Bush\nstated that, \u201c[w]ith the resolution just passed, . . . Saddam Hussein must fully\ndisclose and destroy his weapons of mass destruction. . . . Any act of delay or\ndefiance will be an additional breach of Iraq\u2019s international obligations. . . . Any\nIraqi noncompliance . . . will show that Iraq has no intention of disarming.\u201d 12 In its\npress release announcing its unanimous approval of UNSCR 1441, the Security\nCouncil reiterated that the resolution merely \u201cafford[ed]\u201d Iraq \u201ca \u2018final opportunity\nto comply\u2019 with its disarmament obligations.\u201d UNSCR 1441 Press Release, supra\nnote 1. That announcement also quotes U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who\napplauded the resolution and said that \u201c[t]he goal is to ensure the peaceful\ndisarmament of Iraq in compliance with Council resolutions and a better, more\nsecure future for its people.\u201d Id.

The\nMexican delegate, Adolpho Aguilar Zinser, maintained that, \u201c[i]n case of failure to\ncomply, the Council would act\u201d\u2014apparently without regard to whether Iraq had\ngiven an accurate declaration free of any false statements or omissions. Id. Richard\nRyan of Ireland explained that \u201c[t]he resolution was about disarming Iraq,\u201d and\nthat \u201c[t]he Council had given Iraq an opportunity to comply with its disarmament\nobligations.\u201d Id.

Even the Russian delegate, Sergey Lavrov, who contended that \u201cit would not\nbe seen as a violation if\u201d Iraq took \u201cmore than 30 days\u201d to issue its paragraph 3\ndeclaration, nevertheless \u201cemphasized the need for Iraq to comply with all its\ndisarmaments obligations on the basis of today\u2019s resolution.\u201d Id. (emphasis\nadded). We have found no evidence, moreover, to suggest that any member nation of\nthe Security Council believed that noncompliance with inspections or Iraqi refusal\nto disarm would not constitute a \u201cfurther material breach\u201d under UNSCR 1441, so\nlong as Iraq provided a complete and accurate disclosure of its WMD program. In\nlight of the apparent consensus that Iraq\u2019s fundamental obligation was disarmament, it is unsurprising that no pre-enactment history adopts a conjunctive\napproach to paragraph 4 or asserts that honest declarations by themselves could\nprevent a finding of \u201cfurther material breach of Iraq\u2019s obligations.\u201d III.

An additional showing of\nnoncompliance and noncooperation with the resolution is not required, because the\nword \u201cand\u201d in paragraph 4 has a disjunctive, rather than a conjunctive, meaning.
