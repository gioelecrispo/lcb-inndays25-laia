The question has arisen\nwhether a stay pending appeal of a lower court order vacates or defers\nadministrative fund suspension. \u2022N o t e : U nder \u00a7 815(c) o f th e Justice Systems Im provem ent A ct o f 1979, Pub. L. N o. 97-157,\n93 Stat. 1167, 1206-09, the O ffice o f Justice Assistance, Research and Statistics replaced L E A A as the\nentity responsible for adm inistrative enforcem ent o f the nondiscrim ination provisions o f the C rim e\nC ontrol A ct. Ed. 487 Your division takes the position that a stay has the legal effect of\nvacating or deferring such suspension. Both the Department of the\nTreasury and LEA A disagree. The two agencies maintain that the\nadministrative process by which funds are terminated under the two\nacts is independent of any contemporaneous judicial proceeding,\nwhether or not the same issues of discrimination are involved, and\nwhether or not their administrative process has been triggered in the\nfirst instance by a determination in the judicial proceeding. Therefore,\nin their view a stay entered in the judicial proceeding has no effect on\nan administrative decision to suspend funds. The Civil Rights Division\nmemorandum takes the position that the administrative role under both\nstatutes is merely \u201cancillary and supportive\u201d of the judicial process, and\nthat the agencies are therefore obliged \u201cto honor\u201d a judicial stay by\nsuspending their administrative procedures or, if necessary, restoring\nthe flow of federal funds. For reasons stated hereafter, we agree with your Division's position\non the effect of a stay on administrative fund suspension under the\nRevenue Sharing Act, but find merit in the position advanced by\nLEA A in interpreting its responsibilities under the Crime Control Act. We believe the law requires ORS, whose actions are triggered by and\nare to some extent dependent on a judicial determination, to conform its\nactions to those of a court granting a stay. And we think that Congress\nintended this administrative conformity to extend to the restoration of\nfunds already suspended or terminated.

Because in federal court one of the grounds for\ngranting a stay pending appeal in this context is precisely this likelihood\nof success on the merits,1 we believe that Congress, had it considered\n1\nT h e Federal Rules o f C ivil P rocedure p ro v id e that an interlocutory o r final o rd er in an action for\nan injunction will not be stayed except pursuant to the provisions o f Rule 62(c).

Supp. 57\nContinued 488 the issue, would not have approved the continuance of administrative\nprocedures leading to fund termination in the face of a federal judicial\nstay and in disregard of it. The analogous provisions of the Crime Control Act differ signifi\u00ad\ncantly from those of the Revenue Sharing Act, however, and in our\nview these differences make persuasive LEA A \u2019s argument that its own\nadministrative process was intended by Congress to be independent of\nany concurrent litigation involving the same issues of discrimination. At\nthe same time, we believe that LEAA is free under its statute to defer\nadministrative fund suspension in the event of a judicial stay, and that\nsound policy may in some cases dictate such deferral. Unlike ORS,\nhowever, LEAA is probably foreclosed from restoring funds that have\nalready been suspended or terminated except in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth in its statute. Because the relevant provisions of the two statutes differ markedly,\nand because our conclusions with respect to their import for the two\nagencies differ correspondingly, we discuss them separately. I. The Crime Control Act\nSection 518(c)(1) of the Crime Control Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3789d(c)(l),\nprohibits discrimination on grounds of race, color, religion, national\norigin or sex, by a state or local government, in a program or activity\nreceiving funds under a grant administered by LEAA. Section\n518(c)(2), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3789d(c)(2), which was added to the Act in 1976\nby Pub. L. No. 94-503, 90 Stat. 2418, sets out the administrative\nprocedures by which the nondiscrimination provisions in the preceding\nparagraph are enforced. In relevant part these require LEAA, upon\nreceiving notice of a \u201cfinding\u201d by a federal or state court or administra\u00ad\ntive agency to the effect that there has been a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of\ndiscrimination in violation of subsection (c)(1), to set in motion an\nadministrative procedure leading to suspension and, ultimately, termina\u00ad\ntion of funds. Under this procedure LEA A must notify the chief execu\u00ad\ntive of the affected governmental unit that a program or activity has\nbeen found not to be in compliance, and must request that officer to\nsecure compliance. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3789d(c)(2)(A)(i) and (ii). If after 90\ndays compliance has not been secured, and if an administrative law\njudge has not \u201cmade a determination under subparagraph (F) that it is\nlikely the state government or unit of local government will prevail on\nthe merits,\u201d LEAA \u201cshall notify\u201d the Attorney General that compli\u00ad\nance has not been secured \u201cand caused [sic] to have suspended further\npayment of any funds under this chapter to that program or activity.\u201d\n(D . Md. 1976).

The \u201cdetermination under subparagraph\n(F)\u201d is explained in that section as follows:\nPrior to the suspension of funds under subparagraph (C),\nbut within the ninety day period after notification under\nsubparagraph (C), the State government or unit of local\ngovernment may request an expedited preliminary hearing\non the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5, in\norder to determine whether it is likely that the State\ngovernment or unit of local government would, at a full\nhearing under subparagraph (G), prevail on the merits of\nthe issues of alleged noncompliance. A finding under this\nsubparagraph by the administrative law judge in favor of\nthe State government or unit of local government shall\ndefer the suspension of funds under subparagraph (C)\npending a finding of noncompliance at the conclusion of\nthe hearing on the merits under subparagraph (G). At the \u201cfull hearing\u201d under subparagraph (G) referred to in this sec\u00ad\ntion, the issues of discrimination are heard on the merits, and LEAA\nmust make \u201ca finding of compliance or noncompliance.\u201d If LEAA\nmakes a finding of \u201cnoncompliance,\u201d the Attorney General \u201cmay\u201d\nterminate the payment of funds. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3789d(c)(2)(G)(ii). Once funds have been suspended by LEAA there are only four\ncircumstances, set out in subparagraph (D), under which payment may\nbe resumed: (1) if the recipient enters into a compliance agreement\napproved by LEA A and the Attorney General; (2) if the recipient\n\u201ccomplies fully with the final order or judgment\u201d of a court or adminis\u00ad\ntrative agency, if that order or judgment covers all the matters raised in\nL EA A \u2019s original notice of noncompliance; (3) if the recipient \u201cis found\nto be in compliance with subsection (c)(i) by such court\u201d;2 and (4) if\nafter a hearing LEA A finds \u201cthat noncompliance has not been demon\u00ad\nstrated.\u201d 3 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3789d(cX2)(D)(i) through (ii).\n. This statutory scheme suggests an intention on the part of Congress\nto limit agency discretion in certain respects (e.g., mandatory com\u00ad\nmencement of proceedings upon notice of a \u201cfinding,\u201d and mandatory\nsuspension of funds 90 days thereafter); at the same time, it permits\nLEA A to reach its own independent conclusions on the issues of\ndiscrimination raised, and ultimately to make an independent decision to\nlift or continue a suspension pending a full administrative hearing on\n2\nT h e statute inexplicably fails to give the same effect to a similar finding o f an adm inistrative\nagency. 9\nSubparagraph (D ) makes reference to a hearing \u201c pursuant to subparagraph (F ).\u201d But subparagraph\n(F ) describes the \u201cexpedited prelim inary hearing*\u2019 before an adm inistrative law judge.

But the statute does not spell out what\nrelationship if any Congress intended there to be between L E A A \u2019s\nenforcement procedures once they have been set in motion, and any\nongoing judicial or administrative proceedings which may have trig\u00ad\ngered them in the first place. The legislative history of the 1976 amendments to the Crime Control\nAct does little to clarify this relationship. It manifests congressional\ndissatisfaction with the lack of initiative shown by LEAA in enforcing\nthe nondiscrimination provisions of the Act, and an intent to remedy\nthis by forcing the agency into action whenever a court or another\nagency \u201cfinds\u201d the recipient to have engaged in a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d\nof discrimination. Thereafter, however, it would appear that LEA A\nwas perceived as having an enforcement role independent of contempo\u00ad\nraries and related court proceedings. The House report states that \u201cthe\nCommittee bill will require the Administration to honor the discrimina\u00ad\ntion findings of State and Federal courts and State and Federal agencies\nby then beginning its own enforcement process with the sending out of\nnoncompliance notices to recipients found by others to have discrimi\u00ad\nnated.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 1155, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 26 (1976) (emphasis\nadded). 4 The more important evidence of LEA A \u2019s independence comes from\na reading of the statute itself, and from a comparison of its provisions\nwith the analogous provisions of the Revenue Sharing Act. Unlike the\nRevenue Sharing Act, the Crime Control Act contains no provisions\nrequiring deference on the merits to the triggering \u201cfinding\u201d in any part\nof the administrative process. Rather, it would seem that this \u201cfinding\u201d\noperates on the agency only to spur it into \u201cbeginning its own enforce\u00ad\nment process.\u201d 5 As will be discussed in greater detail below, the\nanalogous sections of the Revenue Sharing Act are considerably more\nexplicit with respect to the further substantive effect that should be\ngiven the triggering judicial determination. 4 T he Senate bill had made no changes in the nondiscrim ination provisions o f the C rim e C ontrol\nA ct, and the conference com m ittee reported out provisions that w ere in all pertinent respects identical\nto those in the H ouse bill. See H .R. Rep. No. 1723, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 32 (1976). 5 O ne o f the difficulties in construing L E A A 's obligations under these provisions o f the statute is\nC ongress' failure to define w hat it meant by a \u2018\u2018finding.\u201d It is not clear in the statute o r its legislative\nhistory w h eth er this term was meant to include prelim inary o r interlocutory \u201c findings,\u201d o r w hether it\nshould be limited to formal findings after a full hearing.",

L E A A 's ow n regulations do not define the\nterm, but that agency has apparently interpreted it to include the findings em bodied in a prelim inary\ninjunction order. If the \u201c finding\" is view ed solely as a triggering m echanism, then w e w ould have no\nbasis on w hich to quarrel w ith L E A A 's expansive definition o f the term.

It is precisely\nbecause under the C rim e C ontrol A ct a c o u rt's \u201c findings\" are not substantively binding on L E A A that\nwe are constrained to agree w ith that agency on the legal effect o f a stay. 491 To be sure, the Crime Control Act provides that payment of sus\u00ad\npended funds should be resumed if the recipient \u201ccomplies fully with\nthe final order or judgment\u201d of a court. But, by implication, any court\naction short of a \u201cfinal order or judgment\u201d would in itself permit no\nsuch resumption. Therefore, when funds have already been suspended\nby LEAA, a stay in the related judicial proceeding does not, in our\nopinion, have any effect on the suspension. On the other hand, where\nfunds have not yet been suspended and the agency inquiry is still under\nway, the statute does not appear to compel any particular agency\nresponse to developments in litigation involving the same issues. The\nopportunity provided the recipient in subparagraph (F) to defer suspen\u00ad\nsion by demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits before an\nadministrative law judge suggests a general congressional policy under\u00ad\nlying the Act which we think would permit LEAA to defer its own\nsuspension proceedings where a stay has been granted by the court\nwhose \u201cfindings\u201d triggered those proceedings in the first place.

In sum, based on our reading of \u00a7 518(c)(2) of the Crime Control Act\nand its legislative history, we agree with LEA A that its administrative\nprocess is independent of the triggering judicial or administrative pro\u00ad\nceedings; that suspended funds may be resumed only upon the happen\u00ad\ning of one of the events specified in subparagraph (D); and in particular\nthat it is not required under the statute to bring its own administrative\nprocess to a halt in the event a stay is obtained in a contemporaneous\nand related judicial proceeding. On the other hand, we do not think\nLEAA is precluded from taking into account the implications of a stay\norder in the course of its own pre-suspension proceedings. The congres\u00ad\nsional policy reflected in subparagraph (F) would fully support a deci\u00ad\nsion by LEAA to honor such a stay, and defer suspension pending a\nfull administrative hearing on the merits. Indeed, we think in some\ncircumstances LEAA would not be remiss in its responsibilities under\nthe statute in deferring all administrative action pending a resolution of\nthe issues raised in the court proceeding. 6\nII.

But the Senate had its own proposals to make with respect to\nthe Revenue Sharing Act, proposals that were quite different from\nthose of the House, and that were in the main accepted by the Confer\u00ad\nence Committee. The \u201ccompromise\u201d 7 reached in conference between the House and\nSenate on the nondiscrimination enforcement programs of the Revenue\nSharing Act was enacted into \u00a7 122 of the Act by Pub. L. 94-448, 90\nStat. 2350, and is codified in \u00a7 1242 of title 31. A brief review of its\npertinent provisions shows how the Senate\u2019s approach differed from\nthat of the House in the Crime Control Act. Like the analogous\nprovisions of the Crime Control Act, \u00a7 122(b)(1) contains a triggering\nmechanism for the commencement of administrative enforcement pro\u00ad\nceedings leading to fund termination. This triggering mechanism is\ndescribed in \u00a7 122(c)(1) as a \u201cholding\u201d by a federal or state court, or\nfederal administrative law judge, that the recipient state government\nhas discriminated in violation of federal law.8 Once the Secretary of\nthe Treasury has received notice of a \u201cholding,\u201d a notice of noncompli\u00ad\nance must be sent the recipient, and the fund termination procedure set\nin motion. 9 Subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) describe a hearing procedure\n7 122 Cong. Rec. 34,099 (Sept. 30, 1976) (rem arks o f Rep.

N o difference betw een the tw o term s w as asserted in Congress, and none has\nbeen claim ed by either L E A A o r O RS. A s it happened, the term \u201c holding\" was the one em ployed by\nthe Senate in its revenue sharing bill, and the term \u201c finding\" was em ployed by the H ouse in both its\ncrim e control bill and its revenue sharing bill. T he term s \u201c holding\" and \u201c finding\" are used inter*\nContinued 493 before the Secretary of the Treasury and, if requested subsequently, an\nadministrative law judge. It is at this point that the two statutes part\nways. Where the two-step hearing procedure under the Revenue Shar\u00ad\ning Act has been triggered by a \u201cholding\u201d on the issues of discrimina\u00ad\ntion, the substance of this \u201cholding\u201d may not be collaterally attacked\nbefore either the Secretary or the administrative law judge. That is, the\nrecipient may present evidence to the Secretary only on the issue of\nwhether the program or activity in which discrimination is charged has\nbeen federally funded, and not on the merits of the discrimination\ncharge itself. If the Secretary determines that federal funds are in\u00ad\nvolved, and if the recipient then requests a further hearing before an\nadministrative law judge, that officer too is precluded from addressing\nthe discrimination issue on the merits. In case there remains any doubt,\nsubsection (c)(2) restates the restrictions on the administrative process\nas follows: If there has been a holding described in paragraph [(c)(1)]\nwith respect to a State government or a unit of local\ngovernment, then, in the case of proceedings by the Sec\u00ad\nretary pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section or a\nhearing pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of this section with\nrespect to such government, such proceedings or such\nhearings shall relate only to the question of whether the\nprogram or activity in which the exclusion, denial, dis\u00ad\ncrimination, or violation occurred is funded in whole or\nin part with funds made available under subchapter I of\nthis chapter. In such proceedings or hearing, the holding\ndescribed in paragraph [(c)(1)] . . . shall be treated as con\u00ad\nclusive. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1242(c)(2) (emphasis added).

Unless the Secretary or admin\u00ad\nistrative law judge finds that the program in which discrimination is\ncharged is not federally funded, the Secretary \u201cshall\u201d suspend payment\nof funds. Subsection (e) of the statute sets out the five grounds on which\nsuspended payments may be resumed where a \u201cholding\u201d has triggered\nthe suspensions: 1) if the recipient government enters into a compliance\nagreement with the government agency or office responsible for pros\u00ad\necuting the claim or complaint which is the basis for the holding, if the\nagreement has been approved by the Secretary;10 2) if the recipient\ngovernment \u201ccomplies fully with the holding,\u201d if that holding covers\nall matters raised in the Secretary\u2019s notice of noncompliance; 3) if the\nchangeably in both the Senate rep o rt and the conference report on the revenue sharing bill, suggesting\nthat that body did not focus at ail on the difference, if any. betw een them. See S. Rep. No. 1207, 94th\nC ong., 2d Sess. 32 (1976); H .R. Rep. No. 1720, 94th C ong., 2d Sess. 35-36 (1976). Indeed, in discussing\nthe conditions for resum ption o f funds both reports speak o f com pliance w ith an \u201co rd e r\u2019* o f a federal\ncourt, w here the statute uses the term \u201c holding.\u201d Id. See 31 U.S.C. 1242(e)(2). 10 T h e com pliance agreem ent is described in subsection (d)(1). 494 recipient is found to be in compliance by the court or agency that\nissued the holding; 4) if the administrative law judge determines that\nthe recipient is in compliance under subsection (b)(3)\u2014a determination\nwhich may be based only on the presence or absence o f federal funds,\nnot the merits of the discrimination claim; and 5) if the body that has\nissued the triggering holding is reversed by an appellate tribunal. This\nfinal condition of lifting the suspension is also dealt with in subsection\n(c)(3): If a holding described in paragraph [(c)(1)] is reversed by\nan appellate tribunal, then proceedings under subsection (b)\no f this section which are dependent upon such holding shall\nbe discontinued; any suspension or termination of pay\u00ad\nments resulting from such proceedings shall also be dis\u00ad\ncontinued. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1242(c)(3) (emphasis added). The acknowledgment in subsection (c)(3) that the administrative pro\u00ad\nceedings are \u201cdependent\u201d on the proceedings in the triggering body is\nreflected generally in the grounds for resumption of suspended pay\u00ad\nments described above. Three of the five grounds are for all practical\npurposes beyond the control of the Secretary: the first, a compliance\nagreement, is grounds for resumption of payment only where it is\nentered into by the parties to the triggering lawsuit or complaint. The\nthird ground depends on the recipient\u2019s compliance as determined by\nthe triggering body. And the fifth ground depends entirely on the\naction of an appellate tribunal in reversing the triggering holding.",

      "content": "The\nthird ground depends on the recipient\u2019s compliance as determined by\nthe triggering body. And the fifth ground depends entirely on the\naction of an appellate tribunal in reversing the triggering holding. Although there is some independent role reserved to the agency with\nrespect to the first, second, and fourth grounds, the agency is always\nbound to follow the lead of the triggering body whenever the merits of\nthe discrimination issue are involved. The congressional concern to limit the independent enforcement au\u00ad\nthority of the Secretary of the Treasury where there has been a prior\nholding of discrimination is reflected in the legislative history of the\n1976 amendments to the Revenue Sharing Act. As with the Crime\nControl Act, Congress was aware of widespread dissatisfaction with the\nagency\u2019s failure to use its suspension power even where the recipient\nagency had been adjudged by a federal court to be in violation of the\nlaw. See Hearings before the Subcomm ittee on Revenue Sharing o f the\nSenate Finance Committee, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 173, 197, 214 (1975). See also United States v. City o f Chicago, 395 F. Supp. 329 (N.D. 111.\n1975), a f f d 525 F.2d 695 (7th Cir. 1976). However, the Senate\u2019s contri\u00ad\nbution to the provisions that emerged in 1976 as the Conference \u201ccom\u00ad\npromise\u201d reflected equally strong concerns to minimize the burden of\nenforcement on ORS staff, and \u201cto safeguard the due process rights of\nthe recipient.\u201d S. Rep. No. 1207, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 29 (1976). These\nconcerns resulted in the development of provisions limiting the discre\u00ad\n495 tion of ORS where a court or federal agency proceeding was in\nprogress. The hearings in the Senate Finance Committee in August of 1976\ntook place after the House had reported out its bill amending the\nRevenue Sharing Act. That House bill contained nondiscrimination\nenforcement provisions virtually identical to those ultimately enacted in\nthe Crime Control Act. The Senate committee was not satisfied with\nthese provisions on two grounds: first, they placed too heavy an en\u00ad\nforcement responsibility on the staff of the Office of Revenue Sharing,\nwhose officers testified that they did not wish to assume a larger role in\ncivil rights enforcement; and second, they failed to afford a recipient\ngovernment adequate protection against administrative arbitrariness and\nduplicative hearings. The General Counsel of the Treasury Department\ntestified that the elaborate procedures set forth in the House bill\n\u201cwould really require a multiplication of the staff with very little effect\noverall,\u201d and that \u201cthe mechanics set up in the House-passed bill would\ncreate tremendous administrative burdens.\u201d Hearings before the Senate\nC om m ittee on Finance on H .R. 13367, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 48-49 (1976). He recommended that more reliance be placed on the ability of a court\nto monitor compliance, and less on the independent ability of ORS to\nenforce the law. The committee also heard testimony from a number of\nstate and local government officials. The comments of Patrick Lucey,\nG overnor of Wisconsin, are typical: An ideal system of anti-discrimination enforcement would\nemphasize both due process and simplicity to preclude the\nfederal government from arbitrarily suspending revenue\nsharing funds in any jurisdiction.",

Deadlines should be\nshort, and findings of discrimination should be based on\nthe administrative and judicial process which does not\nrely solely on the judgment of the Secretary of the\nT reasury. Id. at 89. Kenneth Gibson, Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, complained that \u201cfederal civil rights enforcement requirements are oftimes duplica\u00ad\ntive and contradictory in nature.\u201d He recommended that \u201ca strategy be\ndeveloped to consolidate and coordinate federal civil rights enforce\u00ad\nment in general and that due process be observed in any withholding of\nfunds from local government.\u201d Id. at 92-93. In a colloquy with Senator\nPackwood, Mr. Gibson and John Poelker, Mayor of St. Louis, dis\u00ad\ncussed the due process problems inherent in simultaneous and poten\u00ad\ntially contradictory administrative and judicial proceedings. Senator\nPackwood asked how to construct \u201ca fair section\u201d that would not\n\u201cunduly penalize\u201d a recipient during the pendency o f a court suit. Poelker recommended that \u201c[i]t should be left up to the decision o f the\ncourt, not the Secretary. . . . As long as the suit is pending, and the\n496 locality has not been found in violation until that time,\u201d funds should\nnot be suspended. Both Mayors Poelker and Gibson emphasized that in\ntheir opinion the inequity of terminating funds prior to \u201cthe end of the\nsuit\u201d outweighed the possibility of undesirable continuance of funds\nduring its pendency. Id. at 77-78. The general criticism of. the House bill in the Senate committee led\nto the drafting of the provisions that eventually were enacted as \u00a7 122. The problems of delay, unfairness, and duplication that witnesses per-,\nceived to be inherent in the House approach were sought to be re\u00ad\nsolved by provisions linking the ORS administrative role more closely\nwith proceedings brought before courts and other agencies. The Con\u00ad\nference Committee accepted the Senate bill in all pertinent respects. H.R. Rep. No. 1720, supra, at 34. From the foregoing discussion it is clear that the terms of the civil\nrights enforcement provisions of the Revenue Sharing Act and their\nlegislative history are substantially different from those of the Crime\nControl Act. We believe these differences warrant a different conclu\u00ad\nsion with respect to the effect a stay on administrative fund suspension\nproceedings under the two acts. Under the Crime Control Act, once\nthe administrative enforcement proceeding has been triggered by a\n\u201cfinding,\u201d LEAA operates independently of the finding. Under the\nRevenue Sharing Act, ORS proceedings are \u201cdependent\u201d from begin\u00ad\nning to end on the concurrent judicial or federal agency proceedings. Since ORS is barred from making its own determination on the issue of\ndiscrimination once there has been a court determination, we think it\nmust also respect the court\u2019s subsequent decision to stay the effect of\nthat determination. This is consistent with the Senate\u2019s concern not to\nburden ORS staff with massive civil rights enforcement responsibilities,\nand to ensure recipient governments due process of law.",
