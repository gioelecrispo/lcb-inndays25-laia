The Commission consists o f nine\nmembers, of whom six are appointed by Congress (three by the Speaker of the\nHouse and three by the Majority Leader of the Senate), and three are appointed\nby the President. Id. \u00a7 3(b)(l)(A)-(C). The appointing authorities are to consult\namong themselves to ensure that the Commission\u2019s membership reflects, \u201c to the\nmaximum extent possible, fair and equitable representation of various points of\nview\u201d with respect to the Commission\u2019s inquiry. Id. \u00a7 3(b)(3). The congressional\nleadership also has the predominant role in selecting the Chair of the Commission. Id. \u00a7 3(b)(5)(A).

We have\npreviously concluded that the Commission is not within the executive branch. 2 Thus, the sole substantive question to be considered here is whether the Commis\u00ad\nsion is an \u201c independent\u201d agency for purposes of \u00a7 208.3 We conclude that it is not. Although the reach of \u00a7208\u2019s reference to \u201c inde\u00ad\npendent\u201d agencies is not clear, and the legislative history is unhelpful (see Part\nI.A below), the Commission falls outside any likely construction of that section. As we discuss in Part I.B below, the Commission does not resemble the agencies\nwhose \u201c independence\u201d from Presidential control was upheld by the Supreme\nCourt in two major cases that preceded the enactment of \u00a7208 \u2014 Humphrey\u2019s\nExecutor v. United Statesk, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and Wiener v. United States,\n357 U.S. 349 (1958). Nor, as we discuss in Part I.C below, do the Commissioners\nenjoy any form of protection from removal under the Act \u2014 and tenure protection\nis, for many purposes, a recognized test of \u201c independence.\u201d Finally, as we discuss\nin Part II below, there is no other affirmative evidence, whether in the text of\nthe Act or otherwise, that Congress intended the Commission to be regarded as\n\u201c independent\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 208. I.\nSection 208 applies to \u201c an officer or employee of the executive branch of the\nUnited States Government, or of any independent agency of the United States.\u201d\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(a). There are at least two possible explanations for Congress\u2019s\ndecision to distinguish between the executive branch and \u201c independent\u201d agencies\nin this context. First, Congress may have intended \u00a7 208 to reach all agencies of the Govern\u00ad\nment other than those within the legislative or judicial branch. \u201c [Independent\u201d\nagencies on this account would be those agencies that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s\nolder jurisprudence, might have been considered to be \u201c hybrid\u201d agencies, outside\nthe executive branch and performing \u201c quasi-legislative\u201d or \u201c quasi-judicial\u201d func\u00ad\ntions. 4 Under present Supreme Court doctrine, such \u201c independent\u201d agencies are\n2 S ee L e tte r for M s.

S e e also 30 Applicability o f 18 U.S.C. \u00a7208 to National Gambling Impact Study Commission considered to be parts of the executive branch, although the President\u2019s powerto remove agency heads may be restricted in certain ways. See Morrison v. Olson,\n487 U.S. 654, 689-91 (1988) (interpreting cases on tenure protection for officials\nof independent agencies as hinging on whether protection impaired President\u2019s\nduty to execute the laws). Congress could have understood the term \u201c independent\nagency\u201d in 1962, however, to refer to agencies that we would now consider to\nbe part of the executive branch. On that understanding, \u00a7 208 would apply to the\nexecutive branch, including agencies within the executive whose heads enjoy some\ndegree of protection from presidential removal, and that may have been viewed\nin 1962 as outside the executive branch;5 but it would not apply to the legislative\nor judicial branches. Alternatively, in referring to \u201c independent\u201d agencies, Congress may have been\nrecognizing the possibility that some agencies could be regarded as \u201c inde\u00ad\npendent\u201d even while being firmly located within a particular branch. On this\nreading, \u00a7208 would reach not only \u201c independent\u201d agencies within the executive\nbranch but also any such agencies within the legislative or judicial branches. 6 The pre-1962 case law had at least occasionally noted that in order to be \u201c inde\u00ad\npendent,\u201d an agency might need to be protected from congressional, as well as\nexecutive, control. 7 Moreover, the cases had also suggested that an agency might\nbe, for at least some purposes, \u201c independent,\u201d while yet belonging to a particular\nbranch. 8 Consequently, in applying \u00a7208 to \u201c independent\u201d agencies, Congress\nid at 892 (B ecker, J , concurring in part); Federal T rade C o m m \u2018n v R ubero id C o , 343 U S 470, 487 (1952) (Jack \u00ad\nson, J , dissenting). 5 Thus, w e have no doubt that agencies such as the Federal T ra d e C om m ission ( \u201c F T C \u201d ), w hich H u m p h rey 's\nE xecu to r stated \u201c cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an aim o r an eye o f the ex e cu tiv e ,\u201d 295 U S.\nat 628, should now be regarded as part o f th e executive branch\n6 W e note that the C ourt seem s usually to have understood \u201c independen t\u201d agencies \u2014 for purp o ses o f separation\no f pow ers an a ly sis\u2014 n o t to encom pass agencies w ithin the legislative or jud icial branches T h u s, the C ourt has\nsaid that \u201c independent\u201d agencies are those w hose statutes \u201c typically specify eith er that . . . ag en cy m em bers are\nrem ovable by the P resident for specified causes [such as the FTC] .\n.",

As discussed below, this account of Congress\u2019s\nintent has found support in this Office\u2019s prior opinions. We do not believe it is necessary in this memorandum to decide between these\nalternative readings, because the Commission does not count as \u201c independent\u201d\nunder either of the alternatives we describe. Furthermore, as we discuss below,\nthere is no evidence that Congress intended it to be considered \u201c independent.\u201d A.\nWe begin by reviewing the legislative history of \u00a7 208. We have found little\nrelevant history on the precise point at issue, and what little history there is sheds\nalmost no light on it. \u201c Section 208 was modeled on the former section 434 of title 18, which\n\u2018disqualified] an employee of the Government who has an interest in the profits\nor contracts of a business entity from the transaction of business with such\nentity.\u2019 \u201d Applicability o f 18 U.S.C. \u00a7208 to the Federal Communications\nCommission\u2019s Representative on the Board o f Directors o f the Telecommuni\u00ad\ncations Development Fund, 21 Op.

The legislation represented Congress\u2019s response to the\nperception of several serious inadequacies in those statutes (including \u00a7434),\namong them the fact that they were \u2018\u2018drafted in unnecessarily broad and imprecise\nways,\u201d thus creating \u201c uncertainties as to proper conduct and, to a degree, incon\u00ad\nsistent practices among the departments and agencies of the Government.\u201d Con\u00ad\nflict o f Interest Statutes: Intermittent Consultants or Advisers, 42 Op.

At the time of \u00a7208\u2019s enactment in 1962, two major Supreme Court cases on\n\u201c independent\u201d agencies, Humphrey\u2019s Executor and Wiener, had addressed the\nconstitutionality of statutory limitations on the power of the President to remove\nagency heads or commissioners. Those cases could serve to explain how \u00a7208\u2019s\nreference to \u201c independent agencies\u201d should be construed. In Humphrey's Executor, the Court upheld a statute restricting the President\u2019s\npower to remove a Commissioner of the FTC on grounds of \u201c inefficiency, neglect\nof duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d 295 U.S. at 619. The Court held that the\nconstitutionality of such removal restrictions turned on \u201c the character of the\noffice.\u201d Id. at 631.

We think it plausible to suppose that in 1962, Congress\nwould have understood a statutory reference to \u201c independent agencies\u201d to mean\nagencies such as the FTC or the War Claims Commission, i.e., agencies that were\nnot then considered to be part of the executive branch, or indeed of any of the\nthree branches. Assuming that such was Congress\u2019s intent, we find that the Commission would\nnot be an \u201c independent\u201d agency under the standards of Humphrey\u2019s Executor\nor Wiener. First, unlike the FTC or the War Claims Commission, the Commission\nexercises no functions that under Humphrey\u2019s Executor and Wiener were consid\u00ad\nered to be adjudicatory in nature. Second, the Commission exists solely to conduct\na-study and to report its findings and recommendations to Congress, the President,\nand State and tribal governments. 14 Its responsibilities are \u201c essentially of an inves\u00ad\ntigative and informative nature, falling in the same general category as those\npowers which Congress might delegate to one o f its own committees.\" Buckley\nv. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 137 (1976) (emphasis added). We think that the Commission\nfunctions much as a congressional committee does when conducting an investiga\u00ad\ntion or drafting a legislative proposal based on the information it has gathered;\nindeed, it seems to us that, given its overall statutory structure, the Commission\nis a part of the legislative branch. 15 It is therefore unlike the \u201c headless fourth\nbranch\u201d regulatory agency that Humphrey\u2019s Executor took the FTC to be. In summary: because Humphrey\u2019s Executor and Wiener were assuredly \u201c within\nthe lively knowledge of Congress\u201d when \u00a7208 was enacted. Wiener, 357 U.S.\nat '353, we think that they provide a plausible test of what Congress intended\nwhen referring in that section to \u201c independent agenc[ies].\u201d If that test is applied,\nthen the Commission cannot be counted as \u201c independent.\u201d",

In other\nwords, the Congress that enacted \u00a7 208 may have perceived some agencies as\n\u201c independent\u201d even if they were located in a particular branch (rather than in\na putative \u201c headless fourth branch\u201d ), provided that they resembled the paradig\u00ad\n14 \u201c T his com m ission does not have the pow er to regulate, only to m ake recom m endations It is a study co m m issio n ,\nnot a regulatory body \u201d 142 Cong.

Accordingly, agen\u00ad\ncies in the legislative or judicial branches, as well as in the executive, could be\ncounted as \u201c independent\u201d under \u00a7208. In fashioning this interpretation, we again\nconsult the Supreme Court\u2019s pre-enactment case law. We also find support for\nit in several of this Office\u2019s precedents. As construed by the Supreme Court only a year before \u00a7 208 was enacted, its\nprecursor statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7434 (Supp. II 1946), was said to be designed \u201c to\ninsure honesty in the Government\u2019s business dealings by preventing federal agents\nwho have interests adverse to those of the Government from advancing their own\ninterests at the expense of the public welfare.\u201d United States v. Mississippi Valley\nGenerating Co., 364 U.S. 520, 548 (1961). The individual with whose conflicted\nactivities the Court was most concerned in Mississippi Valley was a part-time\nconsultant to the Bureau of the Budget (the precursor of the Office of Management\n& Budget).

Nonetheless, the Bureau of the Budget could not have been \u201c inde\u00ad\npendent\u201d in the sense indicated by Humphrey\u2019s Executor and Wiener, if only\nbecause the Treasury Department, where the Bureau had been lodged, was plainly\nwithin the executive branch. 16 It is at least conceivable, therefore, that Congress\nintended \u00a7 208 to apply to certain agencies that were acknowledged to belong\nto a particular branch, provided that they had a sufficient resemblance to the con\u00ad\nstitutional paradigms of \u201c independence.\u201d In particular, since protection against\nremoval has figured in the cases as the key element in defining agency \u201c independ\u00ad\nence,\u201d an agency in the legislative or judicial branch could be \u201c independent\u201d\nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 208 if its head enjoyed some form of tenure protection.

To be sure, \u00a7 208 does not ordinarily apply to officers or employees of the legisla\u00ad\ntive and judicial branches. 17 Nevertheless, although an agency is within the legis\u00ad\nlative or judicial branch, we have thought that it might still be considered \u2018\u2018inde\u00ad\npendent\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 208.

As further discussed below,\nhowever, that suggestion ultimately lacks merit. Three OLC opinions are relevant. First, in the GAO Opinion, we found that\nthe GAO was, under \u00a7208, an \u201c independent\u201d body not within the executive\nbranch and arguably within the legislative branch. See GPO Opinion, 9 Op. O.L.C.\nat 57-58 (citing GAO Opinion, 3 Op. O.L.C. 433). The Comptroller General is\nremovable \u201c not only by impeachment but also by joint resolution of Congress,\u201d\nBowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. at 728, and consequently he or she is an officer of\nthe legislative branch who \u201c may not be entrusted with executive powers.\u201d Id.\nat 732. Nonetheless, it remains the case that the governing statute provides that\nCongress may remove that officer only for a cause such as inefficiency, neglect\nof duty, or malfeasance. Id. at 728\u201429. In the GAO Opinion, we analyzed the\neffect of the tenure protection enjoyed by the Comptroller General, together with\nother statutory provisions of title 31, on the status of that officer under \u00a7208. Without denying that the Comptroller General and the GAO are \u201c subservient to\nCongress,\u201d 478 U.S. at 730,18 we found that the statute gave the Comptroller\nGeneral some measure of \u201c independence\u201d from Congress, so that GAO officers\nand employees were properly considered subject to \u00a7 208. We said: The establishment of a fixed tenure of office, subject to removal\nfor cause, has generally been regarded as intended to promote an\nelement of independence of action. C f, Humphrey\u2019s Executor v.\nUnited States, 295 U.S. 602, 624\u201426 (1935). Thus, while the Comp\u00ad\ntroller General and GAO are independent of the executive branch,\nthey apparently are expected to be somewhat independent of the\nlegislative branch as well. I therefore am led to conclude that what\u00ad\never their status for other purposes, the Comptroller General and\nofficers and employees of the GAO are officers and employees of\nan \u201c independent agency of the United States\u201d for purposes of 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 207 \u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 208 and 209 as well. GAO Opinion, 3 Op. O.L.C. at 436.19\nSecond, in the GPO Opinion, we concluded that the GPO is not \u201c independent\u201d\nfor purposes of \u00a7 208. We reached that conclusion despite the fact that the Public\nPrinter is presidentially appointed. Our analysis tracked the judicial view that the\nGPO is an entity within the legislative branch, whose primary function is to pro\u00ad\nvide support for Congress.",

The GPO\u2019s statute, 44\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7301-317, vests appointment power of the Public Printer in the President\n(subject to Senate advice and consent), but is silent as to the Public Printer\u2019s\nremoval. By inference, therefore, the Public Printer can be removed at will by\nthe appointing authority (i.e., the President), and does not enjoy tenure protection. See Dellinger Memorandum, 20 Op. O.L.C. at 172-73 (because the Librarian of\nCongress \u2014 like the GPO, a congressional agency \u2014 \u201c is not protected by an\nexplicit for-cause removal limitation, . . . we therefore infer that the President\nhas at least the formal power to remove the Librarian at will\u201d ). Our conclusion\nas to the GPO can thus be read to provide some (indirect) support for the view\nthat an agency in the legislative (or judicial) branch is \u2018 \u2018independent\u2019\u2019 for purposes\nof \u00a7 208 if, but only if, its head enjoys a degree of tenure protection. A third opinion addressing the United States Sentencing Commission falls\nwithin this line. See Memorandum for Jamie Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General,\nfrom Teresa Wynn Roseborough, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of\nLegal Counsel, Re: Sentencing Commission/Conflict Rules at 14 (July 21, 1994)\n(\u201c Sentencing Commission Opinion\u201d ). There we found the Sentencing Commis\u00ad\nsion, which had been established by statute as \u201c an independent commission in\nthe judicial branch of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(a) (1994), to be an\n\u201c independent\u201d agency under \u00a7208; see also Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S.\n361, 384\u201485, 390, 393 (1989) (Sentencing Commission held an independent\nagency within judicial branch).",

Here, too, an agency that was located out\u00ad\nside the executive branch was found to be \u201c independent\u201d under \u00a7208, and here\nagain the agency head enjoyed tenure protection. In the present case, this test o f \u201c independence\u201d is not met. Nothing in the\nAct creating the Commission states or implies that Commissioners are to enjoy\nany form of tenure protection. On this reading of the statute (which, like the\nreading outlined in Part I, seems to us a plausible construction), the Commission\nis not subject to \u00a7 208. O f the three OLC precedents considered in this Part, the GPO Opinion, holding\n\u00a7 208 inapplicable, closely fits the circumstances of the Commission. Moreover,\nthe conclusion that the Commission is not \u2018 \u2018independent\u2019\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 208\nunder the test considered here harmonizes with our precedents in another respect:\nit accords with our past view that the section does not cover those who are \u2018\u2018prop\u00ad\nerly regarded as officers or employees o f the Congress or one of its Houses or\na n d D u p lic a tin g , 20 O p.

O.L.C. at 435-36. II. We find no other reason to believe that Congress intended to subject the\nCommission to \u00a7208. On the contrary, our conclusion that the Commission is\nnot \u201c independent\u201d for purposes of \u00a7208 is well supported by the language and\nlegislative history of the Act. First, nothing in the language of the Act itself designates the Commission as\n\u201c independent.\u201d As noted above, this distinguishes the Commission from other\nbodies that we have found to be subject to \u00a7 208, such as the GAO and the Sen\u00ad\ntencing Commission. Second, the language of the Act assumes that the nine Commissioners will rep\u00ad\nresent a variety of distinct and incompatible points of view with respect to gam\u00ad\nbling, and that some Commissioners will be associated with the gambling industry. Thus, section 3(b)(2) of the Act states that \u201c [t]he [Commission] members may\nbe from the public or private sector, and may include . . . members of . . .\nindustry.\u201d",

That the Commis\u00ad\nsion membership was intended to include representatives of different points of\nview \u2014 some of whom could be expected to have financial interests in the\nCommission\u2019s recommendations \u2014 does not in itself mean that \u00a7208 is inappli\u00ad\ncable, see Office of Government Ethics Informal Opinion 82 x 22 (1989 ed.). Nonetheless, the statutory criteria for Commission membership clearly indicates\nthat Congress was not attempting to insulate the Commission from outside influ\u00ad\nences in order to ensure its \u201c independence.\u201d The legislative history confirms that understanding. The House Judiciary\nCommittee\u2019s Report on the legislation, H.R. 497, stated:\nthe Committee expects that the [appointing] authorities may con\u00ad\nsider for appointment representatives of various interested groups\nincluding, gambling proponents and opponents, state gambling\nregulators, federal and state prosecutors, Indian gambling operators,\nprofessionals who treat compulsive gamblers, casino operators,\nactivists who have opposed gambling referenda, state lottery offi\u00ad\ncials, and representatives of non-gambling businesses in areas\naround gambling operations. 39 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 23 H.R. Rep. No. 104\u2014440, pt. 1, at 8 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1192,\n1197. In the House debate, Representative Hyde, Chairman of the House Judiciary\nCommittee that reported out the bill, sought to answer charges that the Commis\u00ad\nsion might be skewed against the gambling industry. He said:\nI believe that this Commission can do the most good if its study\nis as neutral, objective, and comprehensive as possible \u2014 consid\u00ad\nering the views of all sides o f this issue. In that spirit, I proposed\na committee amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 497,\nwhich the Judiciary Committee adopted on a voice vote. My substitute included the vast majority of the provisions con\u00ad\ntained in H.R. 497 as originally introduced, but it added language\nso as to assure that all points of view would be represented on\nthe Commission. Specifically, the bill now requires that the\nappointing authorities consult together to ensure that the overall\nmakeup of the Commission fairly and equitably represents] various\npoints of view. 142 Cong. Rec. 3642-43 (1996).21 Thus, instead of seeking to promote public confidence in the Commission\u2019s\nstudy by requiring that the Commission be \u201c independent\u201d of outside influence,\nCongress preferred an approach in which at least some Commissioners could have\nopen and avowed interests, biases and commitments that would check and balance\nthose o f other Commissioners. From this (partly) \u201c adversarial\u201d system, it was\nhoped that a balanced and objective study would be more likely to result. Plainly,\na Commission so conceived would be very likely to include members whose per\u00ad\nsonal stakes in the outcome of the Commission\u2019s work would be disqualifying\nunder \u00a7 208, if that statute were to apply.",
