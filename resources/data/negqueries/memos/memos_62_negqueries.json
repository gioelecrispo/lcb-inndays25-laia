In these cases, individuals with hemophilia who contracted\nthe HIV virus, and representatives of the estates of such individuals who have\ndied, sued several companies who extracted the blood proteins that hemophiliacs\nlack (known as Factors VIE and IX ) from donated blood and provided these pro\u00ad\nteins in the form o f \u201c factor concentrates\u201d to hemophiliacs for injection. In addi\u00ad\ntion to suing these \u201c Fractionaters,\u201d as the companies are known based on the\nmanufacturing process involved, plaintiffs also sued the National Hemophilia\nFoundation and individual health care providers. 2 Although the United States chose not to intervene in the suits, it also had poten\u00ad\ntial claims against the Fractionaters, including those under MCRA based on the\nprovision of certain health care to veterans. 3 MCRA provides a mechanism for\nthe recoupment of certain medical costs and provides in relevant part: In any case in which the United States is authorized or required\nby law to furnish or pay for hospital, medical, surgical, or dental\ncare and treatment . . . to a person who is injured or suffers a\ndisease . . . under circumstances creating a tort liability upon some\nthird person . . . to pay damages therefor, the United States shall\nhave a right to recover (independent o f the rights of the injured\nor diseased person) from said third person, or that person\u2019s insurer,\nthe reasonable value of the care and treatment so furnished, to be\nfurnished, paid for, or to be paid for and shall, as to this right be\nsubrogated to any right or claim that the injured or diseased person\n. . .

The Fractionaters also approached the federal government with an offer to settle\nany claims of the United States based on the provision of health care to hemo\u00ad\nphiliacs, including veterans, who contracted the HIV virus. The Torts Branch, in\ncooperation with the respective agencies responsible for the health care services\ninvolved, entered into an out-of-court settlement with the Fractionaters, under\nwhich the latter paid the United States ten cents per federal health care system\nbeneficiary and released the United States from all claims and actions arising out\nof, or related to, the use of factor concentrates by claimants. In exchange, the\nUnited States released the Fractionaters from all claims for reimbursement of med\u00ad\nical expenses, all claims and causes of action under certain civil fraud statutes,\nand common law contribution and indemnity rights related to Federal Tort Claims Act cases brought against the United States. See Settlement Agreement ^1 A &\nB .l-2 . The settlement figure was calculated based on agency estimates of the numbers\nof persons entitled to federally subsidized health care in each o f the federal pro\u00ad\ngrams that the Torts Branch believed had potential claims of reimbursement\nagainst the Fractionaters.

On March 25, 1998, the Department of Veterans Affairs requested that the\namount of $2,510,457 (which represents the settlement that was calculated based\non the veteran population of 25,881,000, i.e. $2,558,100, less the Department of\nJustice\u2019s 3% collection fee)6 be deposited in the VA Fund pursuant to the Vet\u00ad\nerans Reconciliation Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1729A. 5 Agency estimates of covered individuals in the other programs that the Torts Branch identified as having potential\nclaims against the Fractionaters were as follows: Medicare (38,600,000), Medicaid (38,700,000), Indian Health Serv\u00ad\nices (1,500,000), Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (9,000,000), Civilian Health and Medical Program\nof the Uniformed Services (5,300,000), and Department o f Defense (2,900,000). 6 Pub L No. 103-121, \u00a7108, 107 Stat 1153, 1164 (1993) provides* \u201c Notwithstanding 31 U.S.C 3302 or any\nother statute affecting the crediting of collections, the Attorney General may credit, as an offsetting collection, to\nthe Department o f Justice Working Capital Fund, for fiscal year 1994 and thereafter, up to three percent of all\namounts collected pursuant to civil debt collection litigation activities of the Department of Justice \u201d 253 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 22 II.

In addition to cases covered by the express exception in\n\u00a7 3718(b), which relates to payments to private counsel retained to assist in the\npursuit of claims, the MRA generally does not govern in two situations: first,\nwhere an agency has statutory authority to direct funds elsewhere, and second,\nwhen receipts qualify as \u201c repayments\u201d to an appropriation. See generally 2 Office\nof the General Counsel, United States General Accounting Office, Principles of\nFederal Appropriations Law 6-108 (2d ed. 1992).7 In 1972 the Comptroller General opined with regard to MCRA (as it existed\nthen), that \u201c [t]his Act does not specify the disposition to be made of monies\ncollected from third party tortfeasors and, consequently, unless a different disposi\u00ad\ntion is otherwise provided, such collections are for deposit in the treasury as mis\u00ad\ncellaneous receipts as provided by \u00a73617, revised statutes 31 U.S.C. 484 [the\npredecessor to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3302(b)].\u201d 52 Comp.

See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U S. 714, 727-32 (1986). 8 In 1996 Congress had amended M CRA to allow amounts recovered for medical care furnished by military facili\u00ad\nties to be credited to the appropnaiions supporting the facilities as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. Pub\nL No. 104-201, \u00a7 1075(a)(5), 110 Stat 2422, 2661 (1996) (codified as amended at 42 U S C \u00a72651(0 (1994 &\nSupp 11 J996). 254 Miscellaneous Receipts Act Exception fo r Veterans' Health Care Recoveries In our view, the Veterans Reconciliation Act allows the portion of the settlement\namount that was based on claims under MCRA for medical care furnished or\nto be furnished by the Department of Veterans Affairs under Chapter 17 of Title\n38 to be deposited in the VA Fund.9 Even payment based on an abstract formula,\nsuch as ten cents per covered person, as opposed to a calculation o f actual\nexpenses for such claims, would qualify as long as the calculation was aimed\nsolely at settling the MCRA claim. MCRA specifically allows for the United States to recover for \u201c the reasonable\nvalue of the care . . . furnished, to be furnished, paid for, or to be paid for.\u201d\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651(a). Thus, some estimate of the value of future costs would be\ninevitable in determining damages even in a direct court action against the\ntortfeasor. Moreover, in the context of a settlement, as long as the federal govern\u00ad\nment had claims that it could assert in good faith under MCRA for such services,\nsuch claims could be relinquished in return for payment of a reasonable amount\nreflecting the value of the claims. The Attorney General has the authority to settle\na claim consistent with the requirements of the specific scheme under which the\nclaim arises. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7516, 519 (1994); see generally Settlement Authority\no f the United States in Oil Shale Cases, 4B Op. O.L.C. 756 (1980). Nothing in\nMCRA would appear to indicate that Congress intended to limit the Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral\u2019s discretion to determine a reasonable settlement amount. Even when that\namount is determined based on an abstract formula, the government may still be\nrecovering the money for purposes of satisfying the MCRA claim.",

Even when that\namount is determined based on an abstract formula, the government may still be\nrecovering the money for purposes of satisfying the MCRA claim. For example,\nthe government may have determined that the ten-cents-per-veteran formula is\nan appropriate approximation of the actual expenses incurred in providing MCRA\nrecoverable Chapter 17 services to affected veterans. Thus, to the extent the tencents-pcr-veteran formula was aimed at determining a reasonable figure to com\u00ad\npensate the United States for the relinquishment of its MCRA claims against the\nFractionaters for Chapter 17 services, the resulting recovery would be \u201c a recovery\nor collection under [MCRA] . . . based on medical care or services furnished\u201d\nto veterans under Chapter 17. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1729A(b). Furthermore, because the\npayment of the settlement was apparently received on August 15, 1997, the\nrecovery would appear to fall within the time limits of the Veterans Reconciliation\nAct. We caution, however, that to the extent the settlement amount was calculated\nto include compensation to the United States for relinquishment of claims other\nthan the MCRA claims that are outlined above (i.e. to the extent the settlement\namount included compensation for claims that might have been made under, for\n9 In light of the formulation in MCRA providing for the recoupment o f costs for care and treatment \u201c furnished,\nto be furnished, paid for, or to be paid for,\u201d 42 U S C \u00a72651(a), we believe that the Veterans Reconciliation\nAct formulation concerning the transfer of funds recovered under MCRA for medical carc or services \u201c furnished\nunder this Chapter,\u201d 38 U S C \u00a7 l729A(b), should be read as authorizing the transfer of funds recovered under\nMCRA for medical care or services that were furnished in the past or will be furnished in the future under Chapter\n17. 255 Opinions of the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 22 example, the False Claims Act or civil monetary penalty laws, or for claims of\ncommon law contribution or indemnity rights relating to Federal Tort Claims Act\ncases), the amount of the settlement that was considered to compensate the United\nStates for these other claims could not be deposited in the VA Fund. Similarly,\nwe note that any MCRA claim recovery formula based on the entire veteran popu\u00ad\nlation must reflect only the government\u2019s claims regarding Chapter 17 services\nand must not include claims relating to services furnished or paid for under other\nhealth benefit programs, if the formula is intended to yield an amount that may\nbe deposited in the VA fund. Accordingly, we conclude that the share of the settlement amount attributable\nto MCRA recoverable Chapter 17 services rendered by the Department of Vet\u00ad\nerans Affairs (less the 3% Department of Justice collection fee) may be deposited\nin the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Care Collections Fund.",
