According to the COPS Office, community policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies,\nwhich support the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address\nthe immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of\ncrime.

The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed\nfor any allowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your CPD award is listed on your\naward document. Your award number is in the following format: 2014-XX-XX-XXXX for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 awards. The COPS\nOffice tracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency\u2019s\naward number (or your agency\u2019s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five\nnumbers or letters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for\nuse in tracking information for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award\ninformation based upon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI,\nthe COPS Office assigns a non-official ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two\ncharacters will be \u201cZZ\u201d). If you have any questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number\nor your agency\u2019s ORI number when corresponding with the COPS Office. 2 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual Your OJP vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency\u2019s nine- or thirteen-digit federal tax\nidentification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service.

Extensions\nYour agency may request an extension of the grant award period to receive additional time to implement your\ngrant program. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Only those awardees that can provide a\nreasonable justification for delays will be granted no-cost extensions. Extension requests must be received prior to\nthe end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. When justified, the COPS Office will seek to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether\na no-cost time extension is needed. Requests to extend the award period must be received by the COPS\nOffice before the official award end date. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension by the end\ndate may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. Please note that the project period of performance will be extended, if necessary, until the deliverable is\nconsidered final. If the award is set to expire, prior to the final approval of the deliverable, a no-cost extension\nwill be executed for a reasonable amount of time for the awardee to complete the final deliverable. 7. Modifications\nAward modifications under the Community Policing Development program are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. All modification requests involving the reallocation of funding between budget categories in excess of 10\npercent of the total award amount must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their purchase or\nimplementation. In addition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that\nresults in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you are required to expend federal\nfunds only as approved in the FCM. Any request to change or alter an award should be submitted to the COPS\nOffice for prior approval, prior to their purchase or implementation. Without prior written approval, you must\ncontinue to implement your award as it was originally outlined and accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed\nfunds must be allocated for items covered within the scope of the original intent of the cooperative agreement. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be approved. Your agency may reprogram its budget up to an aggregate (over the course of your project) of 10 percent of\nthe total project cost without prior written approval from the COPS Office.",

The COPS Office will then evaluate your request and notify\nyour agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified award budget may begin following\nwritten approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for active awards will be\naccompanied by a modified Financial Clearance Memo reflecting the approved changes. 8. Evaluations\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS Office Community Policing\nDevelopment program. The awardee agrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nact. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may\nassess the way in which your agency implements its CPD award. COPS Office staff or evaluators may study\nthe effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about\nthe programs\u2019 effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they\nmay ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel\nabout community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other\ncommunities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities,\nand obtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate\nany site visits and information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and\ntimely information about your award activities.",

Reports To assist the COPS Office in the monitoring of your award, your agency will be responsible for submitting periodic\nprogrammatic progress reports and quarterly financial reports. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure\nthe proper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the\nprogress of our programs and awardees. 9 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with CPD\nawards. All reports should be submitted to the COPS Office within the deadlines given to avoid suspension\nor possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions. For more information, please refer to\nsection VII, \u201cReports,\u201d on page 49 of this manual. 10. Award monitoring activities\nFederal law requires that awardees receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be monitored to ensure\ncompliance with their grant conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS Office is also\ninterested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of\ngrant implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process coordinated\nby the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include site visits,\noffice-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and audit\nresolution. As a COPS Office Community Policing Development awardee, you agree to cooperate with and respond\nto any requests for information pertaining to your grant. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must\ncontain a monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how awardees are adhering to COPS\nOffice award requirements and develops the best technical assistance based on this feedback. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an\nentity designated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds, both programmatically\nand financially. The most common ways are: \u2022 site visits. The COPS Office conducts awardee site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. These visits also provide firsthand observation of the awardee\u2019s community policing\nstrategies. Promising practices identified during site visits are documented and may be shared with\nthe law enforcement community. Technical assistance and follow-up actions are conducted to address\npotential and actual vulnerabilities. The purpose of site visits is therefore threefold: review community\npolicing activities, ensure awardee compliance, and provide customer service and technical assistance.

Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that funds the COPS Office, that \u201cthe\nfull and equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal\njustice system is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act\u2019s program to reduce crime and delinquency\nin the United States\u201d (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.301). EEOPs do not impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status,\nthe number of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization has fewer than 50 employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, it is exempt from the\nEEOP requirement.",

If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required\nto report award information on any first-tier subawards totalling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to\nreport information on the names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives\nof the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the\nInternet at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward\ninformation and any executive compensation data required by FFATA. The subaward information entered in\nFSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov associated with your agency\u2019s award, furthering\nfederal spending transparency. 21 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting requirements,\nplease see Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register, www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR2010-09-14/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 25.

Follow the COPS Office Curriculum Standards, Review and Approval Guide and COPS Office Instructor\nQuality Assurance Guide, if developing training curriculum or delivering training under this cooperative\nagreement. A copy of these guides will be supplied to you by your COPS Office Program Manager. The purpose of the COPS Office Curriculum Standards, Review, and Approval Guide is to support the\ndevelopment, review, and approval of COPS Office-funded courses by supplying training providers with\nrecommended instructional guidelines and educating awardees on the process by which curriculum\nwill be reviewed and approved by the COPS Office. The COPS Office will utilize the ADDIE model as a\nprocess to standardize the development, delivery, and evaluation of training developed by the COPS\nOffice training providers. This process will provide the COPS Office with a more effective and efficient\nverification and validation methodology, ensuring the awardees\u2019 capability to develop and deliver\ntraining that advances and promotes the practice of community policing. The ADDIE model is an industry standard for curriculum development. This instructional design process\nwill be used as the foundation for developing curriculum for the COPS Office training. The design\nprocess includes the following:\n1. Analysis \u2013 This is the first stage of the ADDIE and focuses on gathering information on the what,\nwhere, why, for whom, and by whom in preparation for creating curriculum that fills the learning\nneeds of students. 2. Design \u2013 This stage of the ADDIE focuses on creating the blueprint for the instructional experience,\nsuch as the structure of the content and learning materials, etc. 3. Development \u2013 This stage of the ADDIE focuses on production\u2014where the plans that are created\nduring the design phase become a reality. This phase addresses how the instructional materials will\nbe used to support learning and engage students in innovative and productive ways. 34 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual 4. Implementation \u2013 This stage of the ADDIE tests and deploys the course to determine whether the\ncomponents function as designed within the identified environment (online, classroom, etc.). 5. Evaluation \u2013 This stage of the ADDIE ensures that the course functions as designed with actual end-users. It is the goal of the COPS Office to maintain the COPS Office training products and services, keeping them\ncurrent, relevant, and applicable through comprehensive updates on community policing methodology,\ntools, and techniques.

If you are a new awardee to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated Clearing\nHouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on the\nCOPS Office website at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=100. Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nWashington, DC 20531 43 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual Your agency must complete the \u201cPayee/Company Information\u201d section following the directions on the back\nof the form and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial\ninstitution must complete the \u201cFinancial Institution Information\u201d section and have the appropriate financial\nofficial sign the form. If you are already a COPS Office awardee, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the newly awarded\naward as long as your OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your\nACH enrollment form information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you are\nrequired to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFRs) using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able\nto make drawdowns from your award account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on\nfile with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Awardees are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via\nthe Internet at www.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see section VII of this\naward owner\u2019s manual, titled \u201cReports,\u201d on page 49. Filing the FFR (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar quarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance.",

Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment\nto ensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as\nnoted above. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if\nthe awardee \u2022 is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\n\u2022 maintains excess cash on hand;\n\u2022 does not adhere to the terms and conditions of the award;\n\u2022 fails to submit reliable or timely reports. How often do we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements. However, reimbursement\nis only for costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. As a general guideline, most\nagencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly basis. Also, please note that a date range for a\nreimbursement request can only be used once. 44 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual Can we earn interest on our award funds? Your agency should minimize the time between your draw down of award funds and your payment of\naward costs to avoid earning excess interest on your award funds. You must account for interest earned on\nadvances of federal funds as follows:\nLocal units of government may keep interest earned on all advances of federal funds up to $100 per federal\nfiscal year in the aggregate. Interest earned in excess of $100 must be remitted promptly, but at least\nquarterly, to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management Systems, P.O. Box\n6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Except as provided in 28 C.F.R. Part 70.22(l), nonprofit organizations may keep interest earned on all advances\nof federal funds up to $250 per federal fiscal year in the aggregate. Interest earned in excess of $250 must be\nremitted annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management Systems,\nP.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Please notify the COPS Office Finance Division when any interest that is earned is remitted to Department of\nHealth and Human Services (HHS), Payment Management Systems, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. After\na check for the interest is remitted to HHS, please send a copy to the COPS Office Finance Division. State governments, including any agency or instrumentality of a state, should follow the provisions of the\nIntergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6501 et. seq.) pertaining to the disposition of interest earned\non federal funds. Matching funds Under the COPS Office Community Policing Development Program, no local match is required. The\nCOPS Office is funding 100 percent of the allowable items approved in your FCM.",

Any agency desiring to\ncontribute additional funds to this project is encouraged to do so and report these funds on SF-425 as a\nrecipient share of expenditures. 45 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual V. FINANCIAL RECORD MAINTENANCE Under the COPS Office CPD Program, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems\nand financial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include\nboth federal funds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately\naccount for the funds awarded. Your accounting system should \u2022 present and itemize actual expenditures of funded items;\n\u2022 demonstrate that funds are spent in compliance with your award conditions;\n\u2022 be able to provide the necessary information for periodic financial review and audit. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and\ncomplete disclosure of the financial activity under your CPD award. Your accounting records should contain\ninformation showing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll\nrecords, time and attendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized\npurposes only. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must documents be kept? All financial records, including payroll, time and attendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, and\nsimilar documents associated with your CPD award should be kept for at least three years from the date the\nCOPS Office officially closes the award. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving\nthese records has been started before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until\ncompletion of the action. These records should be easily located and should be properly protected against\nfire or other damage. Failure to maintain adequate records to document award expenditures may result in a\nrequirement to repay all federal funds that cannot be supported with appropriate records. What if we have more than one award? If your agency has more than one COPS Office award or an award from another federal agency, funds\nreceived under one project may not be used to support another project without specific written\nauthorization from the COPS Office, or in the case of an award from another agency, from both awarding\nagencies. Your accounting systems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project\nseparately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the DOJ, the Comptroller General of the\nUnited States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may access these records for\nthe purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 46 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual VI.

      "content": "46 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual VI. FEDERAL AUDIT REQUIREMENTS In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent\nexaminers. The two primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice\n(DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audits. Requirements and audits What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving\nfederal financial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised June 27, 2003 and again\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The Office of Management and Budget Circular A-1 33 (OMB A-1 33), Audits of\nStates, Local Governments and Non-Profit Organizations, provides additional guidelines regarding the\nimplementation of SAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? Each non-federal entity that expends a total amount of federal awards equal to or in excess of $500,000 in\na fiscal year is required to have a Single Audit conducted, except when it elects to have a program-specific\naudit conducted. An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or a vendor. Specifically, \u201cFederal awards\nexpended as a recipient or a subrecipient would be subject to an audit under A-133, Subpart B, Section 210.\u201d\nSAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute,\nin effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA\naudit is to express opinions on the awardee\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major\naward programs, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address\nspecific compliance issues with respect to the COPS Office award requirements. Failure to have an audit performed may result in sanctions imposed by federal agencies for noncompliance\nwith Circular A-133. These sanctions could include withholding part of your federal award until a required\naudit is completed satisfactorily, withholding or disallowing overhead costs, suspending your award until the\naudit is performed, or terminating your award. Your Single Audit Act reports should not be sent to the COPS Office. If the U.S. Department of Justice is your\ncognizant federal agency (see the Glossary of Terms on page 90 of this manual), they should be sent to the\nFederal Audit Clearinghouse at:\nFederal Audit Clearinghouse\nBureau of Census\n1201 East 10th Street\nJeffersonville, IN 47132\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) serves as the liaison between awardees and\nauditors in the conduct of SAA audits. Questions and comments regarding SAA audits may be directed to\nthe COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. What is the role of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG)? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The primary objective of OIG audits is to assess compliance with award conditions.",

The OIG may conduct a COPS Office award audit in response to a referral that the OIG believes warrants\nfurther evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ agencies on an annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit\nareas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the OIG selects awards based on a number of\nfactors, including the geographical distribution of awards awarded, award amount, population served, and\ntype of award (both active and expired). As such, the fact that your award has been selected for an OIG audit\nis not necessarily indicative of a suspected concern or problem area. The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division serves as the liaison between awardees and the OIG\u2019s Audit\nDivision, which conducts the audit. After the OIG notifies the COPS Office of upcoming audits to be\nconducted, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division will send out a notification letter to the awardee\noutlining the scope of each audit and the anticipated audit timeframe. This notification letter also advises\nawardees of the supporting documentation required and information necessary for the OIG during their\nscheduled field work, and provides a COPS Office point of contact to address questions and concerns. If you\nhave any questions regarding an OIG audit, please contact the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division at\n800-421-6770. Questions and comments regarding the administration of your COPS Office CPD award, not\nspecifically related to an audit, should be referred to your COPS Office Program Manager. Typical audit findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to awards as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems:\nunallowable costs. Awardee incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget, were in excess of\nthe approved budget, or were charged to the award after the expiration date and an award extension was\nnot obtained. unsupported costs. Specific award expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported, or award\nexpenditures were in excess of actual award costs. lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Awardee failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner or had inadequate record keeping systems. supplanting. Awardee could not document efforts to backfill vacant positions or awardee could not explain\nreductions in local law enforcement budget during the award period. funds to better use.

REPORTS As part of the CPD program, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as\nwell as program progress reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CPD program\naward funding separately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal grants and\nawards) to ensure accurate financial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should\nensure that you have financial internal controls in place to monitor the use of CPD program funding\nand ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms and conditions. Good practices in this area\nwould include written accounting practices, an accounting system that tracks all drawdowns and award\nexpenditures, and the ability to track when award-funded positions are filled or approved purchases are\nmade. Failure to submit complete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result in the suspension\nand possible termination of your agency\u2019s COPS Office award funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end\nof the award period.

WHEN THE AWARD PERIOD HAS ENDED At the end of your agency\u2019s Community Policing Development award period, the COPS Office is\nresponsible for the closeout of your award. As part of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation\ndemonstrating that your agency has met all of the programmatic and financial requirements of the award. After the end of the award period, your agency will be asked to submit a final Federal Financial Report and\nany applicable final program reports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final FFR (SF-425) for your award is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after the end of the award\nperiod. The final report should reflect the total amount of federal expenditures and the amount of unobligated\nfunds, if any. Additionally, it should reconcile with the amount of funds drawn down by your agency. When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated funds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency\nhas incurred but not yet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the award period to request\nreimbursement for funds obligated. Please be advised that 28 C.F.R. Part 66.50(c) requires awardees to submit final Federal Financial Reports\n(SF-425) and to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of\nthe award. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess award funds remaining in your account following the award\nperiod due to an overestimate of item costs during the award period.",

Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1. Community partnerships\n2. Organizational transformation\n3. Problem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the\nindividuals and organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages\ninteractive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems\nthrough collaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in\nprioritizing and addressing public safety problems. Other government agencies\nLaw enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement,\nand schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal\nand informal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource\nfor identifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific\ngoals at town hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the\ncommunity, and team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners.",

Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncommon interests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue\ngroups, advocacy groups, community development corporations, and the faith community. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners\nbecause they often bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own\nsecurity technology and community outreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can\nalso assist in disseminating information about police and business partnerships and initiatives, and crime\nprevention practices. 63 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can\nassist with publicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government\nor community agencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a\nsignificant impact on public perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed\nand how the infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages the application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing emphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and\ninfuse it throughout the entire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel,\nand its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout\nthe agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor\nrelations, decentralized decision making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures,\norganizational evaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem\nsolving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and\ncommunication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement\ncommunity policing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore,\nmust constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within their\norganization and support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way\nof doing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must\nbe a part of the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy.",

Including labor groups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to\ncommunity policing implementation. Decision making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision making. Decentralized decision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community\npolicing. When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels\naccountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision making involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk\ntaking in problem-solving efforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing\nsufficient authority to coordinate various resources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy\nto establish relationships with the community will help define problems and develop possible solutions. 64 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan\nis to have value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples\nof their efforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and values statement\nshould be simple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure\nthat community policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving\nand partnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of\nprocedures, where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime\nrates) community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include such things as\ngreater community satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality\nof life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks at how\nfeedback information is used, not only how outcomes are measured. Transparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the community is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant\ninformation on crime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. Organizational Structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local patrol officers have\ndecision-making authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term\nassignments, the development of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods\nor areas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance customer service and facilitate more contact\nbetween police and citizens, thus establishing a strong relationship and mutual accountability.",

Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers have to be able to handle multiple responsibilities and take a\nteam approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the community. Community policing\nencourages its adoption agency-wide, not just by special units, although there may be a need for some\nspecialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly complex problems or managing\ncomplex partnerships. Resources and finances\nAgencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources to support community policing to\nensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained and effective. 65 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an\nagency including recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from\nsworn officers to civilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be\naligned with the agencies\u2019 community policing values. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment,\nselection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving\nresponsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service, instead of only a spirit\nof adventure. A community policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it is seeking recruits,\nwhom it is recruiting and hiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community\ninvolvement in this process through the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations\nSupervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are\nincorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional procedures should support\nsound problem-solving activities, proactive policing, community collaboration, and citizen satisfaction with\npolice services. Training\nTraining at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles and tactics. It also needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to identify\nand correct conditions that could lead to crime, raise public awareness, and engage the community in finding\nsolutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving\nand help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized in\nthe organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information systems (technology) Community policing is information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in helping to provide ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their beat.

In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with improving two-way communication with citizens and in\ndeveloping agency accountability systems and performance outcome measures. Communication/access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the\npublic and internally with their own staff. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages\nagencies to develop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports,\nreverse 911 and e-mail alerts, discussion forums, and feedback on interactive applications (surveys, maps),\nthereby creating on-going dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters,\ne-mail and enhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with\nother entities for more efficient operations. Community policing also encourages the use of technology to\ndevelop accountability and performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics\nand a broad array of measures and information. 66 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely\ninformation on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers\nin their patrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem\nanalysis functions by enabling agencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime\nlocations, and quality-of-life concerns, and to further enhance analysis. SAFECOM guidance\nThe Department of Homeland Security Office of Emergency Communications, in coordination with various\nstakeholder groups, develops the annual SAFECOM Guidance on Emergency Communications Grants. The guidance provides recommendations to grantees seeking funding for interoperable emergency\ncommunications projects, including allowable costs, items to consider when funding emergency\ncommunications projects, grants management best practices for emergency communications grants, and\ninformation on standards that ensure greater interoperability. The guidance is intended to ensure that\nfederally-funded investments are compatible and support national goals and objectives for improving\ninteroperability nationwide. Grantees (including sub-grantees) that are using TRGP funds to support\nemergency communications activities should comply with the latest version of SAFECOM Guidance,\nincluding provisions on technical standards that ensure and enhance interoperable communications. The\nmost recent version of SAFECOM guidance is available at www.safecomprogram.gov/grant/Default.aspx. Quality and accuracy of data Information is only as good as its source, and therefore it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and\naccuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information\nfrom various sources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked\nto one another and checked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem\nsolving, and performance measurement. Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses.

Problem solving\nmust be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to\nthink innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential\nresponses. A major conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured\nand disciplined way is the SARA (scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine\nthe scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more\nincidents similar in one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can\nbe a type of behavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. 67 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses,\nestablish correlation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is\nimportant to find out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?,\nwhen?, where?, how?, why?, and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem. The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem or reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the\nproblem declined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the\ncurrent effort but also gathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be\nassessed for process, outcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information\ngathered during analysis should be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new\nsolutions can be developed and tested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear,\nmeaning that additional scanning, analysis, or responses may be required.",

Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for\nexample, capable guardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders\n(e.g., parents, friends, and probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees,\nand motel clerks). Rather than focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the police\nfocus on the factors that are within their reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to victims,\nincreasing guardianship, and associating risk with unwanted behavior. 68 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual Appendix D \u2013 Sole source justification facts What is \u201csole source\u201d procurement?

Guidance for requesting a consultant rate based on employment\nConsultants associated with educational institutions (including state-run educational institutions). If\nrepresenting the academic institution, the maximum rate of compensation that will be allowed is the\nconsultant\u2019s academic salary projected for 12 months, divided by 260. These individuals normally receive\nfringe benefits that include sick leave for a full 12-month period, even though they may only work 9 months\nper year in their academic positions. This does not apply to individuals providing consultant work outside\nof their academic commitments. In such cases, the rate of compensation will be based on reasonable cost\nprinciples and requires documentation supporting the requested rate. Consultants employed by state and local government. Compensation for these consultants will be allowed\nonly when the unit of government will not provide these services without cost. If a state or local government\nemployee is providing services under a federal grant and is representing his or her agency without pay from\nits respective unit of government, the rate of compensation is not to exceed the daily salary rate for the\nemployee paid by the unit of government. If the state or local government employee is providing services\nunder a federal grant and is not representing his or her agency, the rate of compensation is based on the\nnecessary and reasonable cost principles. Please note that under the nonsupplanting requirement of the\nCOPS Office statute, COPS Office award funds may not be used to supplant (replace) local funding which\notherwise would have been spent on consultants employed by state or local government. The statute bars\nfederal funding of existing consultants and also of newly hired consultants that a community is committed\nto fund in the absence of a COPS Office award. Consultants employed by commercial and not-for-profit organizations. These organizations are normally\nsubject to competitive bidding procedures. Thus, if they have been selected through competitive bidding,\nthey are not subject to the $550 per day maximum compensation threshold. In those cases where an\nindividual has authority to consult without employer involvement, the rate of compensation should not\nexceed the individual\u2019s daily salary rate paid by his or her employer, subject to the $550 limitation. 84 COPS Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Owner's Manual To request approval of a consultant rate in excess of $550 per day, please submit the signed request on\nawardee department letterhead and include the agency ORI and the award number for which the approval\nis being sought.
