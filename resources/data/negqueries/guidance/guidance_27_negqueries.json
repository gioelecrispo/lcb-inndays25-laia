Hurwitz\nActing Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons\n1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n\u00a7571.60 Purpose and scope. Under 18 U.S.C. 4205(g), a sentencing court, on motion of the Bureau of\nPrisons, may make an inmate with a minimum term sentence immediately\neligible for parole by reducing the minimum term of the sentence to time served. Under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A), a sentencing court, on motion of the Director of\nthe Bureau of Prisons, may reduce the term of imprisonment of an inmate\nsentenced under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. The Bureau uses 18 U.S.C. 4205(g) and 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A) in particularly\nextraordinary or compelling circumstances which could not reasonably have\nbeen foreseen by the court at the time of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. 3582 was amended by the First Step Act of 2018, revisions noted below in Summary\nof Changes. For the purposes of this Program Statement, the terms \u201ccompassionate release\u201d and \u201creduction\nin sentence\u201d are used interchangeably. Federal Regulations from 28 CFR are in this type. Implementing information is in this type. In deciding whether to file a motion under either 18 U.S.C. 4205(g) or 18 U.S.C. 3582, the\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) should consider whether the inmate\u2019s release would pose a danger to\nthe safety of any other person or the community. Under 18 USC 3582 (d)(2)(3), the Bureau ensures that all facilities regularly and visibly post,\nincluding in prisoner handbooks, staff training materials, and facility law libraries and medical\nand hospice facilities, and make available to prisoners upon demand, notice of\u2014\n(i) a defendant\u2019s ability to request a sentence reduction pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A);\n(ii) the procedures and timelines for initiating and resolving requests described in clause (i); and\n(iii) the right to appeal a denial of a request described in clause (i) after all administrative rights\nto appeal within the Bureau of Prisons have been exhausted. \u00a7572.40 Compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. 4205(g).\n18 U.S.C. 4205(g) was repealed effective November 1, 1987, but remains the\ncontrolling law for inmates whose offenses occurred prior to that date. For\ninmates whose offenses occurred on or after November 1, 1987, the applicable\nstatute is 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(1)(A). Procedures for compassionate release of an\ninmate under either provision are contained in 28 CFR part 571, subpart G.\na. Program Objectives. The expected results of this program are:\n\u25a0 A motion for a modification of a sentence will be made to the sentencing court only in\nparticularly extraordinary or compelling circumstances that could not reasonably have been\nforeseen by the court at the time of sentencing. \u25a0 The public will be protected from undue risk by careful review of each compassionate release\nrequest. \u25a0 Compassionate release motions will be filed with the sentencing judge in accordance with the\nstatutory requirements of 18 U.S.C. 3582 or 4205(g). b.

Implementing information: this type. 2 The following have been added to this version of the Program Statement:\n\u25a0 Requirements of section 603(b) of the First Step Act, codified at 18 USC \u00a7 3582:\n\uf0d8 Requiring inmates be informed of reduction in sentence availability and process;\n\uf0d8 Modifying definition of \u201cterminally ill;\u201d\n\uf0d8 Requiring notice and assistance for terminally ill offenders;\n\uf0d8 Requiring requests from terminally ill offenders to be processed within 14 days;\n\uf0d8 Requiring notice and assistance for debilitated offenders; and\n\uf0d8 Specifying inmates may file directly to court after exhaustion of administrative\nremedies, or 30 days from receipt of a request by the Warden\u2019s Office. 2. INITIATION OF REQUEST \u2013 EXTRAORDINARY OR COMPELLING\nCIRCUMSTANCES\n\u00a7 571.61 Initiation of request \u2013 extraordinary or compelling circumstances. a. A request for a motion under 18 U.S.C. 4205(g) or 3582(c)(1)(A) shall be\nsubmitted to the Warden. Ordinarily, the request shall be in writing, and\nsubmitted by the inmate. An inmate may initiate a request for consideration\nunder 18 U.S.C. 4205(g) or 3582(c)(1)(A) only when there are particularly\nextraordinary or compelling circumstances which could not reasonably have\nbeen foreseen by the court at the time of sentencing. The inmate\u2019s request shall\nat a minimum contain the following information:\n(1) The extraordinary or compelling circumstances that the inmate believes\nwarrant consideration. (2) Proposed release plans, including where the inmate will reside, how the\ninmate will support himself/herself, and, if the basis for the request involves the\ninmate\u2019s health, information on where the inmate will receive medical treatment,\nand how the inmate will pay for such treatment. b. The Bureau of Prisons processes a request made by another person on behalf\nof an inmate in the same manner as an inmate\u2019s request. Staff shall refer a\nrequest received at the Central Office to the Warden of the institution where the\ninmate is confined. A request for a RIS is considered \u201csubmitted\u201d for the purposes of 18 USC \u00a73582 (c)(1), when\nreceived by the Warden in accordance with this section.

REQUESTS BASED ON MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES The criteria for a reduction in sentence (RIS) request may include the following:\na. Terminal Medical Condition. RIS consideration may be given to inmates who have been\ndiagnosed with a terminal, incurable disease and whose life expectancy is eighteen (18) months\nor less, and/or has a disease or condition with an end-of-life trajectory under 18 USC \u00a7\n3582(d)(1). The BOP\u2019s consideration should include assessment of the primary (terminal)\ndisease, prognosis, impact of other serious medical conditions of the inmate, and degree of\nfunctional impairment (if any). Functional impairment (e.g., limitations on activities of daily\nliving such as feeding and dressing oneself) is not required for inmates diagnosed with terminal\nmedical conditions; however, functional impairment may be a factor when considering the\ninmate\u2019s ability or inability to reoffend.",

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(d)(2)(A), in the case of a diagnosis of a terminal illness, the Bureau\nof Prisons shall, subject to confidentiality requirements:\n(i) not later than 72 hours after the diagnosis notify the defendant\u2019s attorney, partner,\nand family members of the defendant\u2019s condition and inform the defendant\u2019s attorney,\npartner, and family members that they may prepare and submit on the defendant\u2019s\nbehalf a request for a sentence reduction pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A);\n(ii) not later than 7 days after the date of the diagnosis, provide the defendant\u2019s partner\nand family members (including extended family) with an opportunity to visit the\ndefendant in person;\n(iii) upon request from the defendant or his attorney, partner, or a family member,\nensure that Bureau of Prisons employees assist the defendant in the preparation,\ndrafting, and submission of a request for a sentence reduction pursuant to subsection\n(c)(1)(A); and\n(iv) not later than 14 days of receipt of a request for a sentence reduction submitted on\nthe defendant\u2019s behalf by the defendant or the defendant\u2019s attorney, partner, or family\nmember, process the request. The statutory time frames of section 3582(d)(2)(A), begin once the Clinical Director of an\ninstitution makes a terminal diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is made, the Clinical Director will\ninform the Warden and the appropriate Unit Manager as soon as possible so as to ensure\nrequirements are met. P5050.50 1/17/2019 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing information: this type. 4 If the inmate is physically/psychologically able, the inmate should consent to notifications\nabove using Form BP-A0192, Release of Information Consent, or equivalent written\nauthorization. If a visit is denied for security concerns, as reflected in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(d)(3)(J), the reasons\nshould be documented. The Warden will forward the information indicated in Section 8 of this policy, below, to\nCentral Office within 14 days. b. Debilitated Medical Condition. RIS consideration may also be given to inmates who have\nan incurable, progressive illness or who have suffered a debilitating injury from which they will\nnot recover. The BOP should consider a RIS if the inmate is:\n\u25a0 Completely disabled, meaning the inmate cannot carry on any self-care and is totally\nconfined to a bed or chair; or\n\u25a0 Capable of only limited self-care and is confined to a bed or chair more than 50% of waking\nhours. The BOP\u2019s review should also include any cognitive deficits of the inmate (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease or traumatic brain injury that has affected the inmate\u2019s mental capacity or function). A\ncognitive deficit is not required in cases of severe physical impairment, but may be a factor when\nconsidering the inmate\u2019s ability or inability to reoffend.",

REQUESTS BASED ON NON-MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES \u2013 ELDERLY\nINMATES The criteria for a RIS request may include the following:\na. \u201cNew Law\u201d Elderly Inmates. Inmates sentenced for an offense that occurred on or after\nNovember 1, 1987 (e.g., \u201cnew law\u201d), who are age 70 years or older and have served 30 years or\nmore of their term of imprisonment. 1\nb. Elderly Inmates with Medical Conditions. Inmates who fit the following criteria:\n\u25a0 Age 65 and older. \u25a0 Suffer from chronic or serious medical conditions related to the aging process. \u25a0 Experiencing deteriorating mental or physical health that substantially diminishes their\nability to function in a correctional facility. \u25a0 Conventional treatment promises no substantial improvement to their mental or physical\ncondition. \u25a0 Have served at least 50% of their sentence. Additionally, for inmates in this category, the BOP should consider the following factors when\nevaluating the risk that an elderly inmate may reoffend:\n\u25a0 The age at which the inmate committed the current offense. \u25a0 Whether the inmate suffered from these medical conditions at the time the inmate committed\nthe offense. \u25a0 Whether the inmate suffered from these medical conditions at the time of sentencing and\nwhether the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) mentions these conditions. The BOP Medical Director will develop and issue medical criteria to help evaluate the inmate\u2019s\nsuitability for consideration under this RIS category. c. Other Elderly Inmates. Inmates age 65 or older who have served the greater of 10 years or\n75% of the term of imprisonment to which the inmate was sentenced. 1",

All RIS requests should be assessed using the factors outlined in Section 7. 5. REQUESTS BASED ON NON-MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES \u2013 DEATH OR\nINCAPACITATION OF THE FAMILY MEMBER CAREGIVER. The criteria for a RIS request may include the death or incapacitation of the family member\ncaregiver of an inmate\u2019s child, e.g., RIS requests from inmates whose biological or legally\nadopted child or children (\u201cchild\u201d) are suddenly without a family member caregiver due to that\ncaregiver\u2019s death or incapacitation. For these requests, \u201cchild\u201d means a person under the age of 18 and \u201cincapacitation\u201d means the\nfamily member caregiver suffered a severe injury (e.g., auto accident) or suffers from a severe\nillness (e.g., cancer) that renders the caregiver incapable of caring for the child. In reviewing these requests, BOP should assess, based on the information provided, whether\nrelease of the inmate to care for the inmate\u2019s child is in the best interest of the child. a. First Stage of the Warden\u2019s Review. The following information should be provided by the\ninmate to the Warden in writing for RIS requests based on the death or incapacitation of the\nfamily member caregiver:\n\u25a0 A statement that explains that the inmate\u2019s family member caregiver has died or become\nincapacitated and that person was the caregiver for the inmate\u2019s biological or legally adopted\nchild. \u25a0 A statement that this person was the only family member capable of caring for the inmate\u2019s\nchild.\n\u25a0 The name of the deceased or incapacitated family member caregiver and the relationship of\nthat person to the inmate (e.g., spouse, common-law spouse, mother, sister) and statement\nthat the caregiver is a family member of the child. \u25a0 For requests based on a deceased family member caregiver, an official copy of the family\nmember caregiver\u2019s death certificate. \u25a0 For requests based on an incapacitated family member caregiver, verifiable medical\ndocumentation of the incapacitation. \u25a0 Verifiable documentation that the inmate is the parent of the child. Acceptable\ndocumentation includes birth certificates, adoption papers, or verification of the inmate\u2019s\npaternity. P5050.50 1/17/2019 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type.",

The Warden may deny the inmate\u2019s request at the institution level of review if the Warden finds\nthat the inmate has not provided adequate information and documentation as set forth above. b. Second Stage of the Warden\u2019s Review. Even if the inmate provides adequate and sufficient\ninformation and documentation set forth above regarding the RIS request, further investigation is\nappropriate. At this stage, the Warden should convene a committee consisting of the inmate\u2019s\nunit manager, correctional counselor, and any other relevant staff (social worker, physician,\npsychologist, etc.) to investigate the facts and circumstances provided by the inmate and to\nreview supporting letters and documents before the Warden makes a recommendation to approve\nor deny the RIS request.

Wardens should also consider any additional reliable documentation (e.g., letters of support from\nfamily members, neighbors, doctors, hospitals, and state or local agencies). Documentation may\nbe obtained with the assistance of the Office of Probation and Pretrial Services. Wardens should\nalso consider whether the inmate participated in the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program\nand any information relating to the inmate\u2019s substance abuse treatment, physical/mental/\nemotional health, and work evaluations during incarceration.

REQUESTS BASED ON NON-MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES \u2013 INCAPACITATION\nOF A SPOUSE OR REGISTERED PARTNER The criteria for a RIS request may include the incapacitation of an inmate\u2019s spouse or registered\npartner when the inmate would be the only available caregiver for the spouse or registered\npartner. For these requests, \u201cspouse\u201d means an individual in a relationship with the inmate, where that\nrelationship has been legally recognized as a marriage, including a legally-recognized commonlaw marriage. \u201cRegistered partner\u201d means an individual in a relationship with the inmate, where\nthat relationship has been legally recognized as a civil union or registered domestic partnership.

The following information should be provided by the\ninmate to the Warden in writing for RIS requests based on the incapacitation of the spouse or\nregistered partner:\n\u25a0 Statement that explains that the inmate\u2019s spouse or registered partner has become\nincapacitated. \u25a0 Statement that the inmate is the only family member capable of caring for the spouse or\nregistered partner. \u25a0 Verifiable medical documentation of the incapacitation of the spouse or registered partner.\n\u25a0 A clear statement and documentation of the inmate\u2019s release plan, including housing, and the\nfinancial means to care for the spouse or registered partner immediately upon release. \u25a0 Written authorization from the inmate and others (as needed) for the BOP to obtain any\ninformation or documents from any individual, medical entity or doctor, or any government\nagency about the inmate, the spouse or registered partner, or other family members. The Warden may deny the inmate\u2019s request at the institution level of review if the Warden finds\nthat the inmate has not provided adequate information and documentation as set forth above. b. Second Stage of the Warden\u2019s Review. Even if the inmate provides adequate and sufficient\ninformation and documentation set forth above regarding the RIS request, further investigation is\nappropriate. At this stage, the Warden should convene a committee consisting of the inmate\u2019s\nunit manager, correctional counselor and any other relevant staff (social worker, physician,\npsychologist, etc.) to investigate the facts and circumstances provided by the inmate and to\nP5050.50 1/17/2019 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing information: this type. 10 review supporting letters and documents before the Warden makes a recommendation to approve\nor deny the RIS request.

Inmate\u2019s current age. Inmate\u2019s age at the time of offense and sentencing. Inmate\u2019s release plans (employment, medical, financial). Whether release would minimize the severity of the offense. When reviewing RIS requests, these factors are neither exclusive nor weighted. These factors\nshould be considered to assess whether the RIS request presents particularly extraordinary and\ncompelling circumstances. Overall, for each RIS request, the BOP should consider whether the inmate\u2019s release would pose\na danger to the safety of any other person or the community. 8. APPROVAL OF REQUEST\n\u00a7571.62 Approval of request. P5050.50 1/17/2019 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing information: this type. 12 a.
