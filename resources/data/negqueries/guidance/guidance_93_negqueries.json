      "content": "COPS Hiring Program (CHP) grants provide funding directly to law\nenforcement agencies to hire or rehire career law enforcement officers for the advancement of public safety\nthrough an increase in their community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. 2014 CHP grants will cover up to 75 percent of the approved entry-level salary and fringe benefits of each\nnewly hired or rehired full-time sworn career law enforcement officer over the three-year (36-month) grant\nperiod with a minimum 25 percent local cash match requirement and a maximum federal share of $125,000\nper officer position. CHP grant funding is based on your agency\u2019s entry-level salary and fringe benefits for\nfull-time officers at the time of the grant application. Any additional costs above the approved entry-level\nsalaries and fringe benefits are the responsibility of the grantee agency. Furthermore, all grant recipients\nmust retain any CHP-funded officer positions awarded for at least 12 months after the 36 months of\nfederal funding has ended for each position. Funding under this program may be used to do the following: \u2022 Hire new officers, which includes filling existing officer vacancies that are no longer funded in your agency\u2019s budget. These positions must be in addition to your current budgeted (funded) level of\nsworn officer positions, and the officers must be hired on or after the official grant award start date as it\nappears on your agency\u2019s award document. \u2022 Rehire officers laid off by any jurisdiction as a result of state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) budget cuts. The rehired officers must be rehired on or after the official grant award start date as it\nappears on your agency\u2019s award document. Documentation must be maintained showing the date(s)\nthat the positions were laid off and rehired. \u2022 Rehire officers who were, at the time of grant application, scheduled to be laid off (by your jurisdiction) on a specific future date as a result of state, local, or BIA budget cuts. Grantees will be required to\ncontinue funding the positions with local funding until the date(s) of the scheduled layoffs. The dates\nof the scheduled layoffs and the number of positions affected must have been identified in the 2014\nCHP application. In addition, documentation must be maintained detailing the dates and reason(s)\nfor the layoffs. Furthermore, agencies are required to maintain documentation demonstrating that the\nscheduled layoffs are occurring for local economic reasons unrelated to the availability of CHP grant\nfunds. Such documentation may include local council meeting minutes, memoranda, notices, or orders\ndiscussing the layoffs, budget documents ordering jurisdiction-wide budget cuts, or notices provided\nto the individual officers regarding the layoffs. The allowable uses of your agency\u2019s CHP grant are specified on the CHP Financial Clearance Memorandum\n(FCM). If your agency\u2019s local fiscal conditions have changed since submitting the 2014 CHP application and\nyour agency wishes to modify its CHP grant to reprogram awarded funding into a different hiring funding\ncategory, please refer to page 9 of this manual for detailed information on requesting a post-award grant\nmodification. This CHP Grant Owner\u2019s Manual will assist your agency with the administrative and financial matters\nassociated with your grant.",

More\ndetailed guidance regarding any particular grant requirement or your agency\u2019s specific circumstances can\nbe requested through your COPS Grant Program Specialist. 3 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual What you should do:\nPlease read the entire CHP Grant Owner\u2019s Manual carefully prior to signing the grant award document. If\nyou have any questions, please contact your COPS Grant Program Specialist. When accepting your grant\naward, you should ensure that the proper reporting and financial systems are in place to satisfy the grant\nrequirements. 2. Assurances and Certifications The grantee acknowledges its agreement to comply with the Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed\nas part of its CHP application. Why this condition:\nAlthough the COPS Office has made every effort to simplify the process of applying for and receiving grants,\nseveral provisions of federal law require us to seek your Assurances and Certifications regarding certain\nmatters. Most of the Assurances and Certifications apply to all federal grant programs. What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS grant programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at the time\nof application and application update. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have read,\nunderstood, and accepted the grant terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications. Please read these documents carefully, because signatures on these documents are treated as a material\nrepresentation of fact upon which reliance was placed when the U.S. Department of Justice determined\nwhether to award the covered grant. Additional copies of the Assurances and Certifications forms are\ncontained in appendix B on page 39 of this manual. If you have any questions about them, please contact\nyour COPS Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. 3. Allowable costs The funding under this project is for the payment of approved full-time entry-level salaries and fringe benefits over\nthree years (for a total of 36 months of funding), up to a maximum federal share of $125,000 per office position for\ncareer law enforcement officer positions hired and/or rehired on or after the official grant award start date.",

Your agency is required to use CHP grant funds for the specific hiring categories awarded. Funding under this\nprogram may be used for the following categories: \u2022 Hiring new officers, which includes filling existing officer vacancies that are no longer funded in your agency\u2019s\nbudget; \u2022 Rehiring officers laid off by any jurisdiction as a result of state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) budget\ncuts; and/or \u2022 Rehiring officers who were, at the time of grant application, scheduled to be laid off (by your jurisdiction) on a\nspecific future date as a result of state, local, or BIA budget cuts. If your agency\u2019s local fiscal conditions have changed and your agency needs to change one or more of the funded\nhiring categories, your agency should request a post-award grant modification and receive prior approval before\nspending CHP funding under the new category. The Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), included in your award package, specifies the amount of CHP\nfunds awarded to your agency. You should carefully review your FCM, which contains the final officer salary and\nfringe benefit categories and amounts for which your agency was approved. Please note that the salary and fringe\nbenefit costs requested in your CHP application may have been adjusted or removed. Your agency may only be 4 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual reimbursed for the approved cost categories that are documented within the FCM, up to the amounts specified\nin the FCM. Your agency may not use CHP funds for any costs that are not identified as allowable in the\nFinancial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual allowable costs incurred during the grant award period will be eligible for reimbursement and\ndrawdown. If your agency experiences any cost savings over the course of the grant (for example, your grant\napplication overestimated the total entry-level officer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use\nthat excess funding to extend the length of the grant beyond 36 months. Any funds remaining after your agency has\ndrawn down for the costs of approved salaries and fringe benefits incurred for each awarded position during the\n36-month funding period will be deobligated during the closeout process, and should not be spent by your agency. Why this condition:\nCHP funds may only be used to pay for entry-level salaries and fringe benefits for 36 months for full-time\ncareer law enforcement officers hired or rehired on or after the award start date. You may use the CHP grant\nto hire or rehire experienced officers, but grant funding must be limited to paying your agency\u2019s entry-level\nsalary and fringe benefits; any costs higher than entry level must be paid by your agency with local funds.

Refer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable costs. Salaries covered by CHP must be based on\nyour agency\u2019s standard entry-level salary and fringe benefits package under the laws or rules that govern\nhiring by your agency. Salary and fringe benefit payments must be based on payroll records supported by\ntime and attendance records or their equivalent. Examples of the types of records your agency must keep\nto document allowable costs are described in section III of this manual on page 27. Any additional costs\nabove the approved entry-level salaries and fringe benefits are the responsibility of the grantee agency. Civilian positions, salaries and fringe benefits of part-time officer positions, overtime, training, weapons,\ncommunication equipment, and vehicles cannot be funded with your CHP grant. CHP grant funding may be used to pay the approved entry-level salaries and fringe benefits of newly hired\nofficer recruits while they are in basic academy training prior to swearing them in if it is your agency\u2019s\nstandard practice to pay recruits while in training. Please be advised that grantees may not use COPS funding for the same item or service also funded by\nanother U.S. Department of Justice award. 4. Local match\nGrantees are required to contribute a local match of at least 25 percent toward the total cost of the approved\ngrant project, unless waived in writing by the COPS Office. The local match must be a cash match from funds not\npreviously budgeted for law enforcement purposes and must be paid during the grant award period. The local\nmatch contribution must be made on an increasing basis during each year of the three-year grant period, with the\nfederal share decreasing accordingly. Why this condition: The 2014 CHP provides up to 75 percent of the allowable costs of this grant project (up to a maximum\nfederal share of $125,000 per officer position), and grantees are therefore responsible for at least 25 percent\nof the total project costs. The local match must be a cash match made from local, state, or other non-COPS 5 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual Office funds. Federal funds (other than COPS Office funds) may be used to meet your local match only if the\nfederal funds are authorized by statute for that purpose and approved by both the federal agency providing\nthose funds and the COPS Office. What you should do:\nMatching contributions must be made on an increasing basis during each year of the three-year program\nwith the federal share decreasing accordingly. The local match must be paid in full during the active grant\nperiod; payments made prior to the CHP award start date or after the grant end date do not qualify as a local\nmatch.",

If your agency must withdraw from the grant period prior to the end of grant funding, your agency\nis responsible for ensuring that the federal share of funds expended is limited to a maximum of 75 percent\nof the total program costs expended. If you have questions about the timing of your local match payments,\nplease contact your COPS Staff Accountant at 800-421-6770. Your agency must maintain records that clearly demonstrate the source of the local match, the amount of\nthe local match, and when the local match was contributed. The local match must be in addition to funds\npreviously budgeted for specific law enforcement purposes. You do not need to provide these supporting\ndocuments to the COPS Office, but such records must be produced in the event of an audit or site visit. In\naddition, grantees are required to report the amount of local match contributed on the quarterly Federal\nFinancial Report (SF-425), line j. Sources for local match requirements may include: \u2022 Program income funds from asset forfeitures\n\u2022 Funds from state or local governments that are committed to matching funds for your program\n\u2022 Funds from federal programs whose statutes specifically authorize their use as matching funds\n\u2022 Funds contributed by private sources To maximize the number of communities that would be able to take advantage of CHP grant funding, only\na limited number of local match waiver requests were granted to applicants who were able to demonstrate\nsevere fiscal distress. The COPS Office relied on the fiscal health data provided in section 7 of the CHP\napplication and a comparison of the applicant\u2019s fiscal health data with that of the overall 2014 CHP applicant\npool to make waiver decisions. 5. Supplementing, not supplanting\nState, local, or BIA funds budgeted to pay for sworn officer positions irrespective of the receipt of CHP grant funds\nmay not be reallocated to other purposes or refunded as a result of a CHP grant being awarded. Non-federal funds\nmust remain available for and devoted to that purpose, with CHP funds supplementing those non-federal funds. Funding awarded cannot be obligated until after the grant award start date. This means that CHP funds cannot be\napplied to any agency cost or obligation incurred prior to the award start date. In addition, your agency must take\nactive and timely steps pursuant to its standard procedures to fully fund law enforcement costs already budgeted\nas well as fill all locally-funded vacancies resulting from attrition during the life of the grant. Why this condition: The COPS statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that grant funds not be used to replace state or\nlocal funds (or, for tribal grantees, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made available for\nthe grant purposes. Instead, CHP grant funds must be used to increase the total amount of funds that would\notherwise be made available for hiring or rehiring law enforcement officers. What you should do:",

Any budget cuts must be for fiscal or other reasons unrelated to the receipt of CHP grant funds\nto avoid a violation of the nonsupplanting requirement. 6 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual \u2022 Grant recipients may not reduce their locally-funded number of sworn officer positions during the three-year CHP grant period as a direct result of receiving the CHP funding. Reductions in locallyfunded sworn officer positions that occur for reasons unrelated to the CHP funding\u2014such as citywide budget cuts\u2014do not violate the nonsupplanting requirement, but recipients must maintain\ndocumentation demonstrating the date(s) and reason(s) for the budget cuts to prove that they were\nunrelated to the receipt of CHP grant funding in the event of an audit, monitoring site visit, or other\nform of grant compliance review. \u2022 Under CHP, the nonsupplanting requirement means that a grant recipient receiving CHP grant funds to\nhire a new officer position, including filling an existing officer vacancy that is no longer funded in the\nrecipient\u2019s local budget, must hire the additional position on or after the official grant award start date,\nabove its current budgeted (funded) level of sworn officer positions. \u2022 The nonsupplanting requirement also means that a grant recipient receiving CHP funds to rehire an officer laid off as a result of state, local, or BIA budget cuts must rehire the officer on or after the official\ngrant award start date. The grant recipient must maintain documentation in its CHP grant file showing\nthe dates that the officer was laid off and rehired. \u2022 In addition, the nonsupplanting requirement means that a grant recipient that receives CHP grant funds to rehire an officer who was, at the time of grant application, scheduled to be laid off on a\nspecific future date as a result of state, local, or BIA budget cuts, must continue to fund the officer with\nits own funds through the grant award start date until the date of the scheduled layoff. [For example,\nif the award start date is July 1 and the layoff is scheduled for November 1, then the COPS funds may\nnot be used to fund the officer until November 1, the date of the scheduled layoff.] Your agency must\nhave identified the date(s) of the scheduled layoffs and the number of officers to be laid off in its\napplication. Grant recipients must maintain documentation showing the date(s) and reason(s) for the\nlayoffs, the number of officers laid off, the number of officers rehired, and the dates the officers were\nrehired.

Retention At the time of grant application, your agency committed to retaining all sworn officer positions awarded under the\nCHP grant with state and/or local funds for a minimum of 12 months following the conclusion of 36 months of\nfederal funding for each position, over and above the number of locally-funded sworn officer positions that would\nhave existed in the absence of the grant. Your agency cannot satisfy the retention requirement by using CHPfunded positions to fill locally-funded vacancies resulting from attrition. Why this condition: The retention requirement ensures that the increased officer staffing level under the CHP grant continues\nwith state or local funds for a minimum of 12 months after federal funding ends. 7 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual What you should do: At the time of grant application, your agency was required to affirm that it plans to retain all sworn officer\npositions awarded under the CHP grant and identify the planned source(s) of retention funding. Your\nagency committed to retaining each awarded position for at least 12 months following the conclusion of 36\nmonths of federal funding for that position. The retention period begins for an awarded officer position once\nthat position has completed the 36-month implementation period. If an agency is awarded several officer\npositions, the retention period for each individual officer position begins upon completion of 36 months of\nfunding for that position (not based on the cumulative grant award end date). The retained CHP-funded position(s) must be added to your agency\u2019s law enforcement budget with state or\nlocal funds at the conclusion of grant funding, over and above the number of locally-funded sworn officer\npositions that would have existed in the absence of the grant. Absorbing CHP-funded positions through\nattrition (rather than adding the extra positions to your budget with additional funding) does not meet the\nretention requirement. In addition, COPS grant funding may not be used to retain positions awarded under a\nprevious COPS hiring award.",

Your agency should maintain documentation demonstrating when the 36-month grant funding period\nexpired for each awarded position and that each retained position was above and beyond the number of\nofficer positions that your agency would have otherwise funded with state or local funds. We understand\nthat your agency\u2019s identified source(s) of retention funding may change during the life of the grant, so\nyour agency should maintain documentation of any changes in the event of an audit, monitoring, or other\nevaluation of your grant compliance. Please note that your agency is required to retain the officer position(s) awarded under the CHP grant and\nnot the specific officer(s) hired to fill the grant position(s).

If\nyour agency is unable to retain any of the awarded officer positions, you should contact your COPS Grant\nProgram Specialist for further review. 7. Extensions\nYour agency may request an extension of the grant award period to receive additional time to implement your\ngrant program. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Grants may be extended a maximum of 36\nmonths beyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated\non a case-by-case basis. Only those grantees that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted\nno-cost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include difficulties in filling COPS-funded positions, officer\nturnover, or other circumstances that interrupt the 36-month grant funding period. An extension allows your\nagency to compensate for such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding for\neach position awarded. Extension requests must be received prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the grant award period require prior written approval from the\nCOPS Office. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding\nfor costs incurred beyond the official grant award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to\naccommodate reasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS grant. 8 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual What you should do:",

Individual or cumulative requests\ngreater than one-half of the grant\u2019s original term (i.e., 18 months) will require additional justification and\nmust include a detailed timeline. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the grant due to salary and fringe benefits costs that\nwere lower than anticipated, your agency may not extend the 36-month funding period for the purpose of\nexpending those excess funds. Grantees are entitled to a maximum of 36 months of federal funding based\non the approved salary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining\ngrant funds during the closeout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time\nextension, please contact your COPS Grant Program Specialist. 8. Modifications\nDuring the CHP grant award period, it may become necessary for an agency to modify its CHP grant award due to\nchanges in an agency\u2019s fiscal or law enforcement situation. Modification requests should be submitted to the COPS\nOffice when an agency determines that it will need to shift officer positions awarded in one hiring category into a\ndifferent hiring category, reduce the total number of positions awarded, shift funds among benefit categories, and/\nor reduce the entry-level salary and fringe benefit amounts. For example, an agency may have been awarded CHP\ngrant funding for 10 new, additional full-time sworn officer positions, but due to severe fiscal distress/constraints,\nthe agency determines it is unable to sustain all 10 positions and must reduce its request to five full-time positions;\nor an agency may have been awarded CHP grant funding for two new, additional sworn officer positions, but\ndue to fiscal distress/constraints the agency needs to change the hiring category from the new hire category to\nthe rehire category for officers laid off or scheduled for layoff on a specific future date post-application. Grant\nmodifications under CHP are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The COPS Office will only consider a modification\nrequest after an agency makes final, approved budget and/or personnel decisions.",

The COPS Office will only consider a modification\nrequest after an agency makes final, approved budget and/or personnel decisions. An agency may implement the\nmodified grant award following written approval from the COPS Office. Please be aware that the COPS Office will\nnot approve any modification request that results in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, you are required to expend federal funds only as approved in the FCM. In addition,\nunder CHP you are expected to expend funding only for the specific hiring categories awarded, as indicated\non your Award Document. Any requests to change or alter a grant award should be submitted to the COPS\nOffice for prior approval. Following written approval from the COPS Office, implementation of the modified\naward may begin. What you should do: You should notify the COPS Office if you determine that your agency will need to change hiring categories,\nreduce the total number of positions awarded, or make other changes to the entry-level salary and benefit\namounts or categories. To modify your award from the new hire category to the rehire category, your agency 9 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual must submit a COPS Hiring Award modification request form and the required supporting documentation\nto the COPS Office. A copy of this form is available on the COPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ COPS_Hiring_Modification_Form.pdf. For all other modifications, your agency must access www.cops. usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link in the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to\nthe COPS Office, providing the proposed changes, details of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific grant modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified grant award\nmay begin following written approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for\nactive grants will often be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes. If applicable, your agency is required to sign and submit the modified award document via the \u201cAccount\nAccess\u201d link to officially accept the grant modification. 9. Evaluations\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS Hiring Program. The\ngrantee agrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nact. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office\nmay assess the way in which your agency implements its CHP grant. In some jurisdictions, COPS staff or\nevaluators may study the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect\ninformation about the programs\u2019 effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities.",

Evaluators may collect\ninformation about the programs\u2019 effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In\naddition, they may ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how\nresidents feel about community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be\nuseful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and\ninformation-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information\nabout your grant activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 10. Reports To assist the COPS Office in the monitoring of your award, your agency will be responsible for submitting quarterly\nprogrammatic progress reports and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure\nthe proper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the\nprogress of our programs and grantees. What you should do: This grant condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with CHP\ngrants. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report will be required\nto be submitted directly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link of the COPS Office website 10 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using\nStandard Form 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due\nwithin 90 days after the end of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal monies\nspent, unliquidated obligations incurred, and the unobligated balance of federal funds. Agencies with more\nthan one delinquent programmatic or financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays\nin receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to\nimprove compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in section V (\u201cReports\u201d) on\npage 31 of this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid suspension or\npossible termination of grant funds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required reports may also\nimpact future funding opportunities. 11.

Federal civil rights laws As a condition of receipt of federal financial assistance, you acknowledge and agree that you will not (and will require\nany subgrantees, contractors, successors, transferees, and assignees not to), on the ground of race, color, religion,\nnational origin (which includes providing limited-English proficient persons meaningful access to your programs), sex,\ndisability, or age, unlawfully exclude any person from participation in, deny the benefits of, or employment to any person,\nor subject any person to discrimination in connection with any programs or activities funded in whole or in part with\nfederal funds. These civil rights requirements are found in the non-discrimination provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d); the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended (42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3789d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794); the Age Discrimination Act\nof 1975 (42 U.S.C. \u00a76101, et seq.); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.);\nand the corresponding DOJ regulations implementing those statutes at 28 C.F.R.

Part 38, which requires equal treatment of religious organizations in the funding process and\nnon-discrimination of beneficiaries by Faith-Based Organizations on the basis of belief or non-belief. Why this condition: In establishing financial assistance programs, Congress linked the receipt of federal funding to compliance\nwith federal civil rights laws. As a result, grantees are required to comply with the civil rights requirements\nfound in the non-discrimination provisions referenced above. A hold may be placed on your award if it is\ndeemed that your agency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an\nongoing federal civil rights investigation. If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate\nor draw down federal funds under your agency\u2019s COPS grant award until you comply with federal civil rights\nlaws or cooperate with any ongoing federal civil rights investigation. What you should do: As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the\napplicable federal civil rights laws and to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective\nenforcement of such laws and to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes\nproviding access to records, accounts, documents, information, facilities, and staff. 12. Equal employment opportunity plan (EEOP) All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R.

What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status,\nthe number of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization has fewer than 50 employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the EEOP\nrequirement. To claim the exemption, your organization must complete and submit section A of the Certification\nForm to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, 810 7th Street NW,\nWashington, DC 20531. The Certification Form can be found at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/pdfs/cert.pdf. If your organization is a governmental agency or private business and has received an award between\n$25,000 and $500,000 and has 50 or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but\nexcluding political appointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report (formerly called an EEOP Short\nForm), but it does not need to submit it to the OCR for review. Instead, your organization must maintain\nthe Utilization Report on file and make it available to the OCR for review on request. In addition, your\norganization must complete and submit section B of the Certification Form to the Office for Civil Rights\n(OCR), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, 810 7th Street NW, Washington, DC 20531.

Grant monitoring activities\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their grant conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both\naspects of grant implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process\ncoordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Grant monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include\nsite visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting,\nand audit resolution. As a CHP grantee, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests for information\npertaining to your grant. 12 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each grant program must\ncontain a monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how grantees are adhering to COPS\ngrant requirements and develops the best technical assistance based on this feedback. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an\nentity designated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds both programmatically\nand financially. The most common ways are as follows: \u2022 site visits. The COPS Office conducts grantee site visits to ensure compliance with grant terms and conditions. These visits also provide firsthand observation of the grantee\u2019s community policing\nstrategies. Promising practices identified during site visits are documented and may be shared with\nthe law enforcement community. Technical assistance and follow-up are conducted to address\npotential and actual vulnerabilities. The purpose of site visits is therefore threefold: review community\npolicing activities, ensure grantee compliance, and provide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will be notified in writing in advance of any on-site review of your COPS grants. This\nreview is generally performed over a period of one or more days and also provides an opportunity for\nagency representatives to seek assistance on any grant implementation issues. Your agency will be\nnotified in writing of the results and any action required to remedy identified grant violations. \u2022 office-based grant reviews (OBGR). In lieu of a site visit, certain grants are selected for a review conducted at the COPS Office. If selected, your agency will be contacted at the start of this review and\nour staff will work with your agency to correct any grant problems or deficiencies through telephone,\ne-mail, fax, or written correspondence with your agency. \u2022 complaints.

Grantees are responsible for remedying any grant noncompliance that is identified through these or\nother monitoring or auditing activities. Remedies for noncompliance may include, but are not limited\nto: suspending grant funding, repaying misused grant funds, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary\ntermination of remaining grant funds, and restrictions from receiving future COPS grants. To avoid findings of\nnoncompliance, grantees are strongly encouraged to contact the COPS Office at any time during the life of a\nCOPS grant with questions concerning grant requirements and also to maintain all relevant documentation\nthat may demonstrate grant compliance.

Employment eligibility The grantee agrees to complete and keep on file, as appropriate, a Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services\nEmployment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). This form is to be used by recipients of federal funds to verify that\npersons are eligible to work in the United States. Why this condition:\nUnder federal immigration law, all employers are required to take certain steps to ensure that persons that\nare hired are legally permitted to work in the United States. The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration\nServices Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9) outlines the types of documents that an employer\nshould review to confirm that a new hire is eligible for employment. 13 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual What you should do: You do not need to submit any documentation to the COPS Office to satisfy this condition. Rather, you\nshould complete and maintain the I-9 forms for all new employees under the guidelines set forth by the\nBureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. For further information about this requirement, you may\ncontact the Bureau\u2019s Office of Business Liaison at 800-357-2099 or the National Customer Service Center at\n800-375-5283. 15. Community policing\nCommunity policing activities to be initiated or enhanced by your agency were identified and described in your\nCHP grant application. Your agency developed a community policing strategy for the CHP grant with specific\nreference to a crime or disorder problem and the following elements of community policing: a) problem solving\u2014\nyour agency\u2019s plan to assess and respond to the problem identified; b) community partnerships and support,\nincluding related governmental and community initiatives that complement your agency\u2019s proposed use of CHP\nfunding; and c) organizational transformation\u2014how your agency will use these funds to reorient its mission to\ncommunity policing or enhance its involvement in and commitment to community policing. The COPS Office defines community policing as a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies, which\nsupport the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate\nconditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. CHP grants must be\nused to initiate or enhance community policing activities.",

Why this condition: The CHP program is designed to assist agencies advance public safety through the hiring and rehiring of\nsworn officer positions to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This is\nachieved through problem solving, community policing partnerships, and organizational transformation. It enhances police professionalism by providing officers with the skills and motivation to act in innovative\nways to solve community crime-related problems. Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure\nthat it is initiating or enhancing community policing in accordance with your proposed plan as outlined\nin section VI (B) of your CHP application and that the officers hired (or an equal number of redeployed\nveteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance your agency\u2019s community policing activities\nover the life of the grant. The COPS Office may also use this information to understand the needs of the\nfield and potentially provide for training, technical assistance, problem solving, and community policing\nimplementation tools.

Community Policing Self-Assessment Tool (CP-SAT) The COPS Office will require your agency to complete the Community Policing Self-Assessment Tool (CP-SAT) twice\nwithin the grant period, once at the beginning and again toward the end of your grant period. Why this condition:\nThe Community Policing Self Assessment Tool (CP-SAT) is intended to create an objective measure of your\ncurrent community policing practices. You will receive a report summarizing your agency\u2019s community\npolicing activities, which will help you to design your strategic plan, training, and performance reporting\ninitiatives based on your agency\u2019s community policing strengths and areas in need of additional attention. The CP-SAT is provided free of charge as a resource to manage your policing goals; it measures community\npolicing activities and successes, but it does not capture outcome or impact indicators. Administering\nthe CP-SAT twice during your grant period will allow your agency to compare the progress of your\ncommunity policing practices and provide a tool for your administration to reflect back on your agency\u2019s\naccomplishments. The CP-SAT resource can be used as a long-term tool for your agency\u2019s planning and\ntraining, even after your grant period expires. What you should do: This grant condition is to make your agency aware of the CP-SAT administration requirement associated with\nCHP grants. The CP-SAT essentially consists of a short community policing survey which will be administered\nto your agency staff. The COPS Office, through a third-party provider, will conduct this survey and support\nthe entire process, minimizing any burden on your agency personnel. Within four months after you\nsubmit your signed grant award document, you will be contacted to begin the CP-SAT process. For more\ninformation on the CP-SAT, see www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=2686.\n17. Contracts with other jurisdictions\nGrantees that provide law enforcement services to another jurisdiction through a contract must ensure that officers\nfunded under this grant do not service the other jurisdiction, but will only be involved in activities or perform\nservices that exclusively benefit the grantee\u2019s own jurisdiction. 15 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual Why this condition: The CHP grant is intended to benefit the communities within the grantee\u2019s primary law enforcement\njurisdiction. Therefore, the grantee must use the CHP grant funding to benefit its own population exclusively,\nrather than contracting out the COPS-funded officer(s) to other jurisdictions. What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the CHP grant may not provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies\nunless they will directly benefit the grantee\u2019s jurisdiction.",

What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the CHP grant may not provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies\nunless they will directly benefit the grantee\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, a sheriff\u2019s department cannot use a\nCHP-funded officer to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county but can use the\nCHP-funded officer to provide direct law enforcement services to towns within its own county. 18. False statements False statements or claims made in connection with COPS grants may result in fines, imprisonment, or debarment\nfrom participating in federal grants or contracts, and/or any other remedy available by law.

Part 66.12, and for Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit\nOrganizations, 28 C.F.R. Part 70.14, provide that a grantee or applicant may be considered high risk if the\nU.S. Department of Justice determines that there is unsatisfactory performance, financial or administrative\ninstability, nonconformity with award terms and conditions, or other lack of responsibility. In such cases,\nthe U.S. Department of Justice may impose special conditions or restrictions that may include requiring the\nproduction of documentation, financial grant administration training, on-site monitoring, prior approval for\nexpenditure of funds, quarterly progress reports, separate bank accounts, or other requirements. What you should do: In order to obtain a COPS grant, recipients must agree to comply with any additional requirements that may\nbe imposed during the grant performance period if the awarding agency determines that the recipient is a\nhigh-risk grantee. 20.

Who should sign the award document for our agency? The authorized officials are the law enforcement and government executives who have ultimate and final\nresponsibility for all programmatic and financial decisions regarding this grant as representatives of the legal\ngrantee. COPS grants require that both the top law enforcement executive (e.g., chief of police, sheriff, or\nequivalent) and the top government executive (e.g., mayor, board chairman, or equivalent) sign the award\ndocument. For non-law enforcement agencies (universities, etc.), the authorized officials are the programmatic\nand financial officials who have the ultimate signatory authority to sign contracts on behalf of your\norganization.

For assistance with financial management and grant administration, please contact the\nCOPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one method of payment available for accessing federal grant funds\u2014the Grant Payment\nRequest System (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables grantees to use a secure Internet\nconnection to request funds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury. A grantee will be able to review previous requests made since 2007. For\nmore information on the GPRS please go to www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view the\nuser guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a GPRS account? If you are a new grantee to the COPS Office, your law enforcement executive or government executive\nshould receive notification about GPRS shortly after the COPS Office receives your signed award document. This notification will contain all of the information that your agency needs to set up the GPRS payment\nmethod. If your law enforcement executive or government executive do not perform drawdown requests for\nyour agency, your grant administrator will need to go online to https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome\nto log in and register to become a drawdown specialist. You will receive, via e-mail, a temporary password\nand information on how to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach\nto your law enforcement executive or government executive or other financial points of contact to validate\ninformation provided by the drawdown specialist.",

This form can be found on\nthe COPS Office website at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=100. Prior to accessing your grant funds, your agency must mail the original form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 24 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual Your agency must complete the \u201cPayee/Company Information\u201d section following the directions on the\nback of the form and also provide the grant number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial\ninstitution must complete the \u201cFinancial Institution Information\u201d section and have the appropriate financial\nofficial sign the form. If you are already a COPS grantee, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your\nagency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the newly awarded grant as long as\nyour OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment\nform information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you\nare required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able\nto make drawdowns from your grant account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on\nfile with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Grantees are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via\nthe Internet at www.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see section V of this\nGrant Owner\u2019s Manual, titled \u201cReports,\u201d on page 31. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that\ncalendar quarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance.

You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal grant funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as\nnoted above. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the grantee \u2022 is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\n\u2022 maintains excess cash on hand;\n\u2022 does not adhere to the terms and conditions of the grant;\n\u2022 fails to submit reliable or timely reports. How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements. However, reimbursement\nis only for costs that were approved in the FCM. As a general guideline, most agencies request\nreimbursement on a monthly or quarterly basis. Also, please note that a date range can only be used once. 25 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual Can we earn interest on our grant funds? Your agency should minimize the time between your drawdown of grant funds and your payment of grant\ncosts to avoid earning excess interest on your grant funds. You must account for interest earned on advances\nof federal funds as follows: \u2022 Local units of government may keep interest earned on all advances of federal funds up to $100 per federal fiscal year in the aggregate. Interest earned in excess of $100 must be remitted promptly, but at\nleast quarterly, to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management Systems,\nP.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. \u2022 Except as provided in 28 C.F.R. Part 70.22(l), nonprofit organizations may keep interest earned on all advances of federal funds up to $250 per federal fiscal year in the aggregate. Interest earned in excess\nof $250 must be remitted annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Payment\nManagement Systems, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. \u2022 Please notify the COPS Financial Division when any interest that is earned is remitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management Systems, P.O.

What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and\ncomplete disclosure of the financial activity under your CHP grant. Your accounting records should contain\ninformation showing expenditures under the grant and must be supported by items such as payroll records,\ntime and attendance records, cancelled checks, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard grant funds and make sure that they are used for authorized\npurposes only. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must documents be kept? All financial records, including payroll, time and attendance records, cancelled checks, and similar\ndocuments associated with your CHP grant should be kept for at least three years from the date the\nCOPS Office officially closes the grant. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving\nthese records has been started before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until\ncompletion of the action. These records should be easily located and should be properly protected against\nfire or other damage. Failure to maintain adequate records to document grant expenditures may result in a\nrequirement to repay all federal funds that cannot be supported with appropriate records. Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by grant year or by fiscal year, whichever\nyou find more convenient. What if we have more than one grant? If your agency has more than one COPS Office grant or a grant from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization\nfrom the COPS Office, or in the case of a grant from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your\naccounting systems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the\nComptroller General of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office\nmay access these records for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 27 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual IV.

The Single Audit Act of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving\nfederal financial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised June 27, 2003 and again\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003 to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 (OMB A-133), Audits of\nStates, Local Governments and Non-Profit Organizations, provides additional guidelines regarding the\nimplementation of SAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? Each non-federal entity that expends a total amount of federal awards equal to or in excess of $500,000 in\na fiscal year is required to have a single audit conducted except when it elects to have a program-specific\naudit conducted. An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, and/or a vendor. Specifically, \u201cFederal awards\nexpended as a recipient or a subrecipient would be subject to an audit under A-133, Subpart B, Section 210.\u201d\nSAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute,\nin effect on January 1, 1987 to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA\naudit is to express opinions on the grantee\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major\ngrant programs, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address\nspecific compliance issues with respect to COPS grant requirements. Failure to have an audit performed may result in sanctions imposed by federal agencies for\nnoncompliance with OMB Circular A-133. These sanctions under A-133, Section 225 could include \u2022 withholding a percentage of federal awards until a required audit is completed satisfactorily;\n\u2022 withholding or disallowing overhead costs;\n\u2022 suspending your award until the audit is performed;\n\u2022 terminating your award.

The OIG also surveys Department of Justice agencies on an annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit\nareas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the OIG selects grants based on a number of\nfactors, including the geographical distribution of grants awarded, award amount, population served, and\ntype of grant (both active and expired). As such, the fact that your grant has been selected for an OIG audit is\nnot necessarily indicative of a suspected concern or problem area. The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division serves as the liaison between grantees and the OIG\u2019s Audit\nDivision, which conducts the audit. After the OIG notifies the COPS Office of upcoming audits to be\nconducted, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division will send out a notification letter to grantees\noutlining the scope of each audit and the anticipated audit timeframe. This notification letter also advises\ngrantees of the supporting documentation required and information necessary for the OIG during their\nscheduled field work, and provides a COPS Office point of contact to address questions and concerns.

Grantee incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget, were in\nexcess of the approved budget, or were charged to the grant after the expiration date and a grant\nextension was not obtained. \u2022 unsupported costs.

Grantee failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. \u2022 failure to retain. Grantee lacked documentation to support retention planning efforts during the grant period and/or failed to demonstrate an increase in the baseline of locally-funded sworn officer\npositions at the conclusion of the 36 months of federal funding, over and above what the grantee\nwould have funded in absence of the grant. \u2022 supplanting. Grantee could not document efforts to backfill vacant local sworn officer positions, or\ngrantee could not explain reductions in local law enforcement budget or in sworn officer positions\nduring the grant award period. \u2022 lack of adequate community policing.

REPORTS As part of the CHP, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CHP funding\nseparately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal grants) to ensure accurate\nfinancial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial\ninternal controls in place to monitor the use of CHP funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the\ngrant terms and conditions. Good practices in this area include written accounting practices, an accounting\nsystem that tracks all drawdowns and grant expenditures, and the ability to track when each CHP position\nis filled or vacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit complete reports,\nor submit them in a timely manner, may result in the suspension and possible termination of your agency\u2019s\nCOPS grant funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end\nof the grant period.

The online SF-425 requires the same reporting information as the paper\nversion. The use of this online application enables authorized users to view past SF-425s, and allows them to\nfile or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports due? SF-425s for COPS grants must be submitted every quarter and no later than 30 days after the last day of each\nreporting quarter, as detailed in Table 1. Table 1. Due dates of SF-425 by quarter\nReporting Quarters SF-425 Due Date January 1 \u2013 March 31 April 30 April 1 \u2013 June 30 July 30 July 1 \u2013 September 30 October 30 October 1 \u2013 December 31 January 30 For your first SF-425 submission, determine when the most recent SF-425 reporting quarter ended and\ncomplete an SF-425 to cover the period from the award start date of your grant to that particular end date. You are required to submit an SF-425 even if you have not spent any money or incurred any costs\nduring a reporting period. The due dates for online filing of SF-425s are the same as for the submission\nof paper copies. 31 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual Example: If your award start date is 02-01-13 and the current date is 04-15-13, then your first SF-425 would be due no\nlater than 04-30-13 and would cover the period 02-01-13 (award start date) through 03-31-13 (end of the\nmost recent reporting quarter). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office so that you can successfully\ncomplete a drawdown of funds through GPRS. Grantees who do not submit SF-425s by the due date will be unable to draw down funds. The payment\nsystem contains a function which checks for SF-425 delinquency and will reject a drawdown attempt if the\nSF-425 is not up to date. Subsequent e-mail, fax, or hard copy reminders may be sent to the grantee if the\nSF-425 is delinquent.

COMMUNITY POLICING ACTIVITIES The COPS Office defines community policing as a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that\nsupport the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the\nimmediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. CHP grants must be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities. All newly hired, additional,\nor rehired officers funded under CHP (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) must implement\nyour agency\u2019s approved community policing strategy, which you described in your grant application, and\nadvance your agency\u2019s community policing activities over the life of the grant. In your application, you specified a community policing implementation strategy for the CHP grant with\nspecific reference to a specific crime or disorder problem and the following elements of community policing: \u2022 problem solving\u2014your agency\u2019s strategy to assess and respond to the problem identified\n\u2022 community partnerships and support, including related governmental and community initiatives\nthat complement your agency\u2019s proposed use of CHP funding \u2022 organizational transformation\u2014how your agency will use these funds to reorient its mission to\ncommunity policing or enhance its involvement in and commitment to community policing Your organization may be audited or monitored to ensure that it is initiating or enhancing community\npolicing in accordance with the community policing strategy or strategies you indicated in your application\nand that the officers hired (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) are used to implement this\nstrategy. We understand that your community policing needs may change during the life of your grant.",

We\nalso recognize that this strategy may incorporate a broad range of possible community policing strategies\nand activities and that your agency may implement particular community policing strategies from the plan\non an as-needed basis throughout the life of the grant. Minor changes to this plan may be made without\nprior approval of the COPS Office; however, grantees will be required to report on progress or changes\nto the community policing strategy (if any) through required quarterly progress reports. Any changes\nto the community policing scope or strategies originally identified in your CHP application should be\ndocumented within your quarterly progress report. If your agency\u2019s community policing strategy changes\nsignificantly, you must submit those changes to the COPS Office for approval through the quarterly\nprogress report. Changes are significant if they deviate from the specific crime problem(s) originally\nidentified and approved in the community policing strategy submitted with the application. Additional\ninformation about community policing may be found in appendix C, \u201cCommunity Policing Defined,\u201d on\npage 45 of this manual. 34 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual VII. WHEN THE GRANT PERIOD HAS ENDED At the end of your agency\u2019s grant period, the COPS Office is responsible for the closeout of your grant. As\npart of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation demonstrating that your agency has met all of\nthe financial and programmatic requirements of the grant. After the end of the grant period, your agency will be asked to submit a final Federal Financial Report (SF425) and any applicable final program reports. Final Federal Financial Report\nThe final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) for your grant is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days\nafter the end of the grant period. The final report should reflect the total amount of federal expenditures\nand the amount of unobligated funds, if any. The federal funds expended should reflect only the actual\nallowable incurred salary and fringe benefit costs for the 36-month grant period that each grant position\nwas occupied. Additionally, it should reconcile with the amount of federal funds drawn down by your\nagency. The final SF-425 should also report the total amount of the local cash match contributed over the\n36-month grant period, which should be at least 25 percent of the total grant project, unless waived by the\nCOPS Office in writing. When should all of the grant monies be spent? Grant funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the grant period. Obligated funds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency\nhas incurred but not yet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the grant period to request\nreimbursement for funds obligated. Please be advised that 28 C.F.R. Part 66.50(c) requires grantees to submit a Final Federal Financial Report\n(SF-425) and to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration\nof the grant.",

Part 66.50(c) requires grantees to submit a Final Federal Financial Report\n(SF-425) and to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration\nof the grant. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess grant funds remaining in your account following the grant\nperiod due to an overestimate of item costs during the grant period. Your agency should review its records\ncarefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred\nduring the grant period. Any excess unobligated or unspent funds should remain in your account, and will\nbe deobligated during the closeout process. Final Program Progress (Closeout) Report After your grant period has ended, your agency may be sent a final progress or closeout report from the\nCOPS Office and asked to complete it. This report will serve as your agency\u2019s final programmatic report on\nthe grant, and the information your agency provides in this report will be used to make a final assessment of\nyour grant progress. Retention At the conclusion of 36 months of federal funding for each awarded officer position, your agency must\nimplement its plan, submitted at the time of grant application, to retain the additional COPS-funded officer\nposition(s) with state or local funds for a minimum of 12 months as required by grant condition #6 in this\nmanual. If an agency is awarded several officer positions, the retention period for each individual officer\nposition begins upon completion of 36 months of federal funding for each position (not based on the\ncumulative grant award end date). The additional officer positions should be added to your agency\u2019s law\nenforcement budget with state or local funds for at least 12 months over and above the number of locally- 35 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual funded officer positions that would have existed in the absence of the grant. If a position becomes vacant\nduring the retention period, your agency must take active and timely steps consistent with its hiring policies\nand procedures to fill the position with a new, additional officer to complete the remainder of the 12-month\nretention period. Absorbing CHP-funded officers through attrition (rather than adding the extra positions to your budget with\nadditional funding) does not meet the retention requirement. In addition, your agency may not use federal\nfunding from other COPS Office grants to retain positions awarded under a previous COPS Office hiring grant. If you have any questions regarding the retention requirement, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program\nSpecialist at 800-421-6770 or via e-mail at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov. 36 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual VIII.

Problem solving\nProblem solving is the process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified\nproblems to develop effective responses that are evaluated rigorously. \u2022 Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems\n\u2022 Analysis: Analyzing problems\n\u2022 Response: Responding to problems\n\u2022 Assessment: Assessing problem-solving initiatives\n\u2022 Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location)\nCommunity policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving\nmust be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to\nthink innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential\nresponses. A major conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured\nand disciplined way is the SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment) problem-solving model. 45 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine\nthe scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more\nincidents similar in one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community.",

      "content": "An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more\nincidents similar in one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can\nbe a type of behavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Analyzing the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses,\nestablish correlation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is\nimportant to find out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who? what? when? where? how? why? and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Responding to problems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem. The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem to reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem or improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Assessing problem-solving initiatives\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by determining if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort\nbut also gathers data that builds knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for\nprocess, outcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered\nduring analysis should be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be\ndeveloped and tested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those aspects that could have an impact on them\u2014for\nexample, capable guardians for victims, handlers for offenders, and managers for locations. Rather than\naddressing root causes of a problem, the police focus on the factors that are within their reach, such as\nlimiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating risk with\nunwanted behavior.

The range of potential partners is large, and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems\nthrough collaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in\nprioritizing public safety problems. Other government agencies\nLaw enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members and groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal\nand informal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource\nfor identifying community concerns. Partnerships with these factions of the community can engage\nthe community in achieving specific goals at town hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings,\ndecentralized offices/storefronts in the community, and team beat assignments. Nonprofits and service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncertain interests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups,\nadvocacy groups, and the faith community. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners\nbecause they often bring considerable resources to bear on problems of mutual concern. Businesses can\nhelp identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security apparatus\nand community outreach. The local chamber of commerce can also assist in disseminating information\nabout police and business partnerships and initiatives. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. It can\nassist with publicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government\nor community agencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a\nsignificant impact on public perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime.

      "content": "The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed\nand how the infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages the application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing emphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and\ninfuse it throughout the entire department, including the way the department is managed and organized,\nits personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management needs to infuse community policing ideals\nthroughout the agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal\nlabor relations, decentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and\nprocedures, organizational evaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem\nsolving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and\ncommunication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement\ncommunity policing, and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore,\nmust constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within their\norganization and support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the dominant way of\ndoing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor need to\nbe a part of the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor groups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to\ncommunity policing implementation. 48 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual Decision making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and in decision making. Decentralized decision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community\npolicing. When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels\naccountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision making involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk\ntaking in problem-solving efforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing\nsufficient authority to coordinate various resources to attack a problem and allowing the officers the\nautonomy to establish relationships with the community will help define problems and develop possible\nsolutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan\nis to have value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples\nof their efforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and value statement\nshould be simple and communicated widely. Everything should connect back to this plan. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure\nthat community policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street.",

Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure\nthat community policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving\nand partnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of\nprocedures where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime\nrates), community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include such things as\nincreased community satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality\nof life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks at how\nfeedback information is used, not only how it measures outcomes. Transparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the community is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant\ninformation on crime and social disorder problems as well as police operations with the community. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local patrol officers have\ndecision-making authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term\nassignments, the development of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods\nor areas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance customer service and facilitate more contact\nbetween police and citizens, thus establishing a strong relationship and mutual accountability. Beat\nboundaries should correspond to neighborhood boundaries and other government services should\nrecognize these boundaries when coordinating government public-service activities. 49 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers must be able to handle multiple responsibilities and take a\nteam approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the community. Community policing\nencourages its adoption agency-wide, not just in special units, although there may be a need for some\nspecialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly complex problems or managing\ncomplex partnerships. Resources and finances\nAgencies must devote the necessary human and financial resources to support community policing to\nensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustainable and effective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an\nagency, including recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, including\nsworn officers, nonsworn officers, civilians, and volunteers, as well as personnel evaluations, supervision,\nand training. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment,\nselection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving\nresponsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service, instead of only a spirit\nof adventure. A community policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it is looking for recruits,\nwhom it is recruiting and hiring, and what is being tested.",

A community policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it is looking for recruits,\nwhom it is recruiting and hiring, and what is being tested. Some community policing agencies also look for\ninvolvement of the community in this process through the identification of competencies and participation\nin review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations Tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are incorporated into\njob descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional structures should support sound problem-solving\nactivities, proactive policing and community collaboration, and citizen satisfaction with police services. Training\nTraining at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles and\ntactics. It also needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical\nskills, and techniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained\nto identify and correct conditions that could lead to crime, to raise public awareness, and to engage the\ncommunity in finding solutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to\nencourage problem solving and help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community\npolicing is institutionalized in the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take\nplace regularly. Information systems (technology) Community policing is information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in helping to provide ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with improving two-way communication with citizens and in\ndeveloping agency accountability systems and performance outcome measures. 50 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Grant Owner's Manual Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with the ability to communicate externally with the public and internally\nwith their own staff. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages agencies to develop\ntwo-way communication systems through the Internet to provide online reports, reverse 911 and e-mail\nalerts, discussion forums, and feedback on interactive applications (surveys, maps), thereby creating ongoing\ndialogs and increasing transparency. Technology also encourages effective internal communication through memos, reports, newsletters, e-mail\nand enhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other\nentities for more efficient operations. Community policing advocates the use of technology to develop\naccountability and performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a\nbroad array of measures and information. Community policing also promotes the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely\ninformation on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers\nin their patrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem\nanalysis functions by enabling agencies to gather information on greater aspects of events including more\ndetailed information on offenders, victims, crime locations, and quality-of-life concerns, and to further\nenhance analysis. Quality and accuracy of data Information is only as good as its source, and therefore it is not useful if it is not of high quality and accurate.",
