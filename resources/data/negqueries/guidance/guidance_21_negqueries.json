Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national\norigin by recipients of Federal financial assistance. The Guidance presented and\nanalyzed, under Titles IV and VI, a number of factual scenarios involving the\napplication of school discipline, and indicated what conclusions the Departments\nmight reach in each scenario. On March 12, 2018, President Trump announced the formation of a Federal\nCommission on School Safety. President Trump directed the Commission to study\nand make recommendations regarding several issues, including whether the\nGuidance and associated documents should be rescinded. On December 18, 2018,\nthe Commission recommended that the Departments rescind the Guidance and\nassociated documents. States and local school districts play the primary role in establishing educational\npolicy, including how to handle specific instances of student misconduct and\ndiscipline, and in ensuring that classroom teachers have the support they need to\nimplement appropriate discipline policies. States and local school districts must\nalso comply with the antidiscrimination protections contained in federal law,\nincluding Title VI. The Departments have concluded that the Guidance and\nassociated documents advance policy preferences and positions not required or\ncontemplated by Title IV or Title VI. Accordingly, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice have\ndecided to withdraw and rescind the Guidance and associated documents.",
