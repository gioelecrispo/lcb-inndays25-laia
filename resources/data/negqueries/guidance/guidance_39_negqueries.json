The duration of your CPD award is listed on your award document. Your award number is in the following format: 2017-XXXX-XXXX for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 awards. The COPS Office\ntracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency\u2019s award number\n(or your agency\u2019s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI, the COPS Office assigns a 2 nonofficial ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two characters will be \u201cZZ\u201d). If you have\nany questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your agency\u2019s ORI number when you\ncontact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency\u2019s nine- or thirteendigit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP vendor\nnumber differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for administrative\npurposes in connection with this program, and should not be used for IRS purposes. Award terms and conditions The award terms and conditions are listed on your agency\u2019s award document. By accepting this award, you are\nobtaining federal funds from the COPS Office. As part of that agreement, your agency acknowledges that it will\ncomply with these terms and conditions (and, if applicable, any additional special or high risk conditions specific to\nyour agency). The section that follows describes, in detail, all of the award conditions, their rationales, and their\nimplications. It also addresses many frequently asked questions. If you have additional questions concerning any of\nthese award conditions, please contact your COPS Office Program Manager or call the COPS Office Response\nCenter at 800-421-6770. In limited circumstances, your award may be subject to special conditions that prevent your agency from drawing\ndown or accessing award funds until the special conditions are satisfied as determined by the COPS Office. Any\nspecial or high risk conditions will be included in the award document supplement. However, if you have questions\nabout the special or high risk conditions, please contact your assigned COPS Office Program Manager. Reasons for award terms and conditions The requirements of your CPD award are established within\n\u2022 the Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994, which established the COPS Office;\n\u2022 the applicable rules, regulations and policies issued by the US Department of Justice, Office of Management\nand Budget (OMB), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and the United States Treasury;\n\u2022 the specific CPD programmatic requirements established by the COPS Office.",

Indirect costs\nIndirect (facilities and administrative, or F&A) costs are costs incurred for a common or joint purpose that are not\nreadily assignable to a particular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance of\nthe project. Indirect costs are allowable for this program, but must adhere to the standards set forth in the\napplicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance as stated in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 (Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards) as adopted by the US\nDepartment of Justice in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 2800.101. Examples of indirect costs include those incurred for facility\noperation and maintenance, depreciation, and administrative salaries. Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency carefully track and\nupdate its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office award period. 7 The recipient understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of application, it\nwill be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a current indirect cost rate\nagreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the award prohibiting the obligation,\nexpenditure, or drawdown of funds for reimbursement for indirect costs until a current indirect cost rate has been\napproved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS Office. If your agency\u2019s approved indirect cost rate expires during the award period, a current approved rate must be\nsubmitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down award funding for indirect costs. Your expired\nrate must be renegotiated or extended by your cognizant federal agency. An approved indirect cost rate may be\nextended one time for up to four years, and once the cognizant federal agency has approved your extension, you\nmust abide by that rate for the agreed-upon time period. At the end of the extension period, you must renegotiate\na new indirect cost rate. Your agency must advise the COPS Office in writing of any changes to your approved\nindirect cost rate during the award period and must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect\nany rate change. If your agency has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, then you may request a de minimis indirect cost\nrate of 10 percent of modified total direct costs (MTDC).

In addition, if a provisional indirect cost rate is in effect at award closeout, your agency shall proceed with\ncloseout, but you will need to complete an expenditure analysis upon receipt of the approved final indirect cost\nrate to determine if an adjustment is necessary.

If your agency incurred additional indirect costs, then your agency may request a budget\nmodification if the award is still open and award funds are available. If your agency returns or draws down COPS\nOffice funding, then your agency will need to submit a revised final Federal Financial Report (SF-425). See the COPS Office website for a fact sheet on indirect costs:\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2017AwardDocs/cpd/Indirect_Cost_Rate_Fact_Sheet.pdf. Please be advised that recipients may not use COPS Office funding for the same item or service also funded by\nanother US Department of Justice award. See also award condition on \u201cDuplicative Funding.\u201d 4. Supplementing, Not Supplanting\nCondition:\nState, local, and tribal government recipients must use award funds to supplement, and not supplant, state, local,\nor Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds that are already committed or otherwise would have been committed for\naward purposes (hiring, training, purchases, and/or activities) during the award period. In other words, state, local,\nand tribal government recipients may not use COPS Office funds to supplant (replace) state, local, or BIA funds that\nwould have been dedicated to the COPS Office-funded item(s) in the absence of the COPS Office award (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n3796dd-3(a)). 8 Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds not be used to replace state or\nlocal funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made available for the\naward purposes. What you should do: For state, local, and tribal recipients, CPD funds may not be used to pay for any item or cost funded under the\naward (equipment, personnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA\nfunds. In addition, recipients may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within the recipient\u2019s\noperating budget to another as a result of receiving CPD award funds. If you have questions concerning this award\nterm and how it pertains to your project budget, please contact your COPS Office Program Manager. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable\njustification for delays will be granted no-cost extensions. Extension requests must be received prior to the end date\nof the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. When justified, the COPS Office will seek to accommodate reasonable\nrequests for no-cost time extensions to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed.",

Requests to extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before\nthe official award end date. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension before the award end date\nmay result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. Please note that the project period of\nperformance will be extended, if necessary, until the deliverable is considered final. If the award is set to expire,\nprior to the final approval of the deliverable, a no-cost extension will be executed for a reasonable amount of time\nfor the recipient to complete the final deliverable. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nAward modifications under the CPD program are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\n200.308. For federal awards in excess of $150,000, any modification request involving the reallocation of funding\nbetween budget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of the total approved budget 9 requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award amount or budget modification\npercentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In addition, any budget\nmodification that changes the scope of the project requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you are required to expend federal\nfunds only as approved in the FCM. Requests to change or alter an award that meet certain threshold\nrequirements must be submitted to the COPS Office for written approval, prior to their purchase or\nimplementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it was originally\noutlined and accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within the\noriginal scope of the award. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved. Your agency may reprogram its budget up to an aggregate (over the course of your project) of 10 percent of the\ntotal project cost without prior written approval from the COPS Office. However, you should notify your COPS\nOffice Program Manager of any reprogramming that falls below the 10 percent threshold as well. For awards in\nexcess of $150,000, any reprogramming of funds that totals an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the approved\nbudget requires prior written approval from the COPS Office. What you should do: You are required to notify your COPS Office Program Manager if you determine that your agency will need to\nreprogram award funds. If your modification exceeds an aggregated (over the course of your project) 10 percent of\nyour overall award, your agency must access https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov.",

The COPS Office will then evaluate your request and notify your agency of our\ndecision in writing. Implementation of the modified award budget may begin following written approval from the\nCOPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for active awards will be accompanied by a modified FCM\nreflecting the approved changes. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of its award programs. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may be\ncarried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may be improved, and why\ncertain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which your\nagency implements its CPD award. COPS Office staff or evaluators may study the effectiveness of funded\nprograms, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the programs\u2019 effect on crime, victims 10 of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask questions about the challenges\nencountered during project implementation, how residents feel about community policing, and how police feel\nabout their work. This information will be useful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and\ninformation-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information about\nyour award activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is\nused to track your agency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to\ngauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government must be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress of\nour programs and recipients.",

      "content": "In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress of\nour programs and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with CPD\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d tab on the COPS Office website at\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard\nForm 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days\nafter the end of the award period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during\nthe funding period, and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date;\nhowever, you will have a 90-day grace period after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for\neligible expenditures incurred before the award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic\nor financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable\nexpenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports\nare discussed in greater detail in the section titled \u201cReports\u201d in this manual. All reports should be submitted within\nthe deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions; failure\nto submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities. 11 9. Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that recipients receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be monitored to ensure\ncompliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS Office is also\ninterested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of\naward implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process coordinated\nby the US Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include site visits,\noffice-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and audit\nresolution. As a COPS Office award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests for\ninformation pertaining to your award. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain a\nmonitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are complying with COPS Office award\nrequirements. In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance to help\nensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and nonroutine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients\u2019 compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site visits.",

The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to\nconduct site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is\nthreefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award ii. To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies iii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare for\nthe review of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period of one or more days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while on-site or, if\nnecessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer\nservice and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an\nEOBGR conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an\nalternative for conducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall award\nmonitoring strategy. The purpose of the EOBGR is threefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award ii. To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies iii. To provide customer service and technical assistance 12 If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve\nany identified noncompliance issues, if necessary, following the EOBGR interview. In addition, award\nrecipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many\nsources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office\nFinance Division, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a\nnoncompliance issue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous\ncomplainants, media, citizens, law enforcement agencies, other Federal agencies, or other outside\nsources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of\naction to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter\ncontact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the OIG. Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or\nnonviolation based upon the preponderance of the supporting documentation or other facts to determine\nif the award recipient is in compliance or noncompliance.

In the event\nyour agency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with your\nagency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may include\nrepayment of award funds, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance, or providing\nproof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the causes for the\nnoncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award funds,\nor a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time. Under certain conditions, additional\nactions may include referral and placement on the US Department of Justice\u2019s High Risk List, which will include\nmandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training and being subject to\nincreased monitoring of current and future awards while on the list. In the event of criminal misuse of award\nfunds, recipients may also be subject to fines and imprisonment. To avoid findings of noncompliance, recipients\nare strongly encouraged to become familiar with the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Grant Monitoring\nStandards and Guidelines and Award Owner\u2019s Manual for the year in which the award was made. Recipients\nshould also contact their COPS Office Program Manager at any time during the life of a COPS Office award with\nquestions concerning award conditions, terms, or requirements to seek guidance to avoid noncompliance. It is\nnecessary for recipients to maintain all relevant documentation (administrative, financial, and programmatic) used\nto develop the application and implement the award that may be necessary or required to demonstrate award\ncompliance.

What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private\nbusiness and has received a single award for $25,000 or more and has fifty or more employees (counting both fulland part-time employees but excluding political appointees), then it has to prepare a Utilization Report and submit\nit to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within 120 days from the date of the award. Although the OCR has discretion\nto review all submitted Utilization Reports, it will review the Utilization Reports from recipients that receive an\naward of $500,000 or more. To begin developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nhttps://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click EEOP Reporting Tool Login. Additional assistance can\nbe found online at the bottom of the same webpage by clicking the EEO Reporting Tool Job Aid and Frequently\nAsked Questions. If your organization has less than fifty employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the EEOP\nrequirement. To claim the exemption, however, your organization must certify that it is exempt by logging into the\nEEO Reporting Tool on the OCR website at https://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm, providing the\ncontact and organizational profile information, and then submitting a Certificate of Exemption. If you have further questions regarding the EEOP requirements, you may contact an EEOP specialist at the OCR by\ntelephone at 202-307-0690, by TTY at 202-0307-2027, or by e-mail at EEOPforms@usdoj.gov. 12. False Statements\nCondition:\nFalse statements or claims made in connection with COPS Office awards may result in fines, imprisonment,\ndebarment from participating in federal awards or contracts, and/or any other remedy available by law. Why this condition: This condition advises recipients of the consequences of submitting false claims or statements on applications,\nfinancial and programmatic reports, or other award documents. What you should do:\nEnsure that all documentation related to your agency\u2019s receipt and use of award funding (award applications,\nprogress reports, Federal Financial Reports, etc.) is true and accurate. 15 13. Duplicative Funding\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees to notify the COPS Office if it receives, from any other source, funding for the\nsame item or service also funded under this award. Why this condition: This award was made to your agency for approved project costs that are not funded with other funds, including\nfederal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds. Consequently, your agency may not use this funding for items or services\nthat you already have funding for from other sources.

Other compensation, if the aggregate value of all such other compensation (e.g. severance,\ntermination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or\nproperty) for the executive exceeds $10,000. Why this condition: To further federal spending transparency, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006\n(FFATA) requires, among other things, that information on federal awards (federal financial assistance and\nexpenditures) be made available to the public via a single, searchable website, which is www.USASpending.gov. Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and subaward information, and\nthe award term provides guidance to report the related information as required by FFATA. 20 What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and systems\nin place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements should it\nreceive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required to report award information\non any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to report information on the names and\ntotal compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the website at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool\nthat your agency will use to capture and report subaward information and any executive compensation data\nrequired by FFATA. The subaward information entered in FSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov\nassociated with your agency\u2019s award, furthering federal spending transparency. For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting requirements, please\nsee Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register,\nwww.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-09-14/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 17. Debarment and Suspension\nCondition: The recipient agrees not to award federal funds under this program to any party which is debarred or suspended\nfrom participation in Federal assistance programs. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, recipients are required to ensure that federal funds are not given to parties that are\ndebarred or suspended from participation in federal assistance programs. This is to protect the public interest and\nto ensure proper management and integrity in federal activities by conducting business only with responsible\nparties. For details regarding the debarment and suspension requirements, please see 2 C.F.R. Part 180\n(Government-wide Debarment and Suspension), and 2 C.F.R. Part 2867 (DOJ-specific requirements.) What you should do: If under a COPS Office award you enter into a contract for goods or services for $25,000 or more or any subaward,\nyou must verify that the vendor or subrecipient and their respective principals (e.g., owners, top managers) with\nwhom you intend to do business are not excluded or disqualified from participation in federal assistance programs. In addition, you must include a term or condition in the contract or subaward requiring the vendor or subrecipient\nto comply with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 C.F.R. Part 180 (Government-wide Debarment and Suspension)\nand subpart C of 2 C.F.R. Part 2867 (DOJ-specific requirements).",

It does not include audits, site visits, corrective\nplans, or inspection of deliverables. Conviction, for purposes of this award term and condition, means a judgment or conviction of a\ncriminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or a plea, and\nincludes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere.

Why this condition: In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in some\ninstances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: If you have received an award for an item (or group of items) or service in excess of $150,000 and have already\ndetermined that the award of a contract through a competitive process is infeasible, you must provide a written\njustification that explains why it is necessary to contract noncompetitively. The initial determination that competition is not feasible can be made if one of the following circumstances exists:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. The COPS Office authorizes noncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the recipient. The item/service is available only from one source. The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive\nsolicitation. The COPS Office will review your request and the supporting information that you provide and will make a\ndetermination as to whether or not an exception can be made to the general rule regarding competition.

Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using award funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with the\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. By signing the Certification of Review and Representation of Compliance\nwith Requirements in the application, the recipient assured the COPS Office that it will comply with the\nrequirements of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found in 28 C.F.R. Part 23. An\n\u201cinterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system\u201d is generally defined as a system that receives, stores, analyzes,\nexchanges, or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal information systems that protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. 31 If your agency will use award funds to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms of technology)\nand will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not apply to your\naward. What you should do:\nRecipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence Systems/28 C.F.R. Part 23\nas part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to use their award funds to\noperate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use award funds to operate an\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should have indicated this in your application and certified your\nagency\u2019s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Your agency now must\ncomply with 28 C.F.R. Part 23 in operating the interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system funded through your\nCPD award. 30. State Information Technology Point of Contact\nCondition: The recipient agrees to ensure that the appropriate State Information Technology Point of Contact receives written\nnotification regarding any technology or information-sharing project funded by this award during the obligation\nand expenditure period.

As a Federal Government agency whose activities include producing and disseminating law enforcement materials\nto advance public safety through community policing across the nation, the COPS Office has an interest in making\nyour deliverables and products widely available and accessible to the public. The COPS Office may make any work\nthat was developed or purchased under this award publically available by any means without restriction, including\na US Department of Justice website, social media account, a hard copy, or in electronic form. The COPS Office also\nreserves the right, at its discretion, to not publish deliverables and other materials (e.g., reports, publications,\nmanuals, and training curricula) developed under this award as a US Department of Justice resource.

The recipient should pay particular attention to the two areas listed below to ensure that their\napplication of indirect cost rate is in compliance with the existing requirements of the\ngovernment-wide award rules set out by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB):\na. $25,000 Subcontract/Subaward Limitation: Indirect cost rates negotiated on the basis of\nmodified total direct costs may only be applied against the first $25,000 of any subcontract\nor subaward under the agreement. This limitation must be applied to all conference related\nsubcontracts and subawards, including those with hotels and travel agents. See 2 C.F.R. Part\n200, Appendix III.C.2. (Indirect costs\u2014Institutions of Higher Education); 2 C.F.R. Part 200,\nAppendix IV.B.2.c. (Indirect costs\u2014Nonprofit Organizations); or 2 C.F.R. Part 200, Appendix\nVII.C.2.c. (Indirect costs\u2014States, Local Governments, and Indian Tribes). b. Participant Support Costs: Participant support costs are generally excluded from the\ndistribution base. Therefore, indirect costs may not be applied against participant support\ncosts. Participant support costs are direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence\nallowances, travel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or\ntrainees (but not employees) in connection with meetings, conferences, symposia, or\ntraining projects. See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.75. This exclusion applies to the entirety of any\nsubcontracts for the lodging and travel of conference participants or trainees (but not\nemployees). Costs related to contractors of the recipient who are acting in the capacity of a\n\u201cConference Trainer/Instructor/ Presenter/Facilitator\u201d are considered participant support\ncosts. For more information on allowable costs for conferences and training, please see the current\nversion of the DOJ Grants Financial Guide in effect at the time of the award available at\nhttps://ojp.gov/financialguide/DOJ/index.htm. Indirect costs were removed from the budget if\nthe recipient did not provide, at the time of application, either a current approved federal\nindirect cost rate or documentation showing a pending request for approval by the cognizant\nfederal agency. If the recipient has never received a federally approved indirect cost rate, it may\nelect to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) in lieu of\nnegotiating a rate with the cognizant federal agency. See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.414(f).\n30.

Procurement Process In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition when feasible. For\nthe purchase of equipment, technology, or services under a COPS Office award, recipients must follow their own\npolicies and procedures on procurement as long as those requirements conform to the federal procurement\nrequirements set forth in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.317 \u2013 200.326. As described in the award condition titled \u201cSole Source Justification\u201d, recipients are required to submit a sole\nsource justification (SSJ) request to the COPS Office for noncompetitive procurements in excess of $150,000 prior\nto purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract; or entering into a contract\nwith award funds. If submitting a sole source justification request to the COPS Office, please use the format\ndescribed in the \u201cSole Source Justification fact sheet\u201d in the appendices of this manual. If you have any questions regarding the federal requirements that guide procurement procedures, please contact\nyour COPS Office Program Manager. For more information about COPS Office programs and resources, please call the COPS Office Response Center at\n800-421-6770 or visit the COPS Office online at www.cops.usdoj.gov. 51 IV. Accessing Award Funds This section provides answers to payment-related questions, including all the information needed to set up your\npayments. For assistance with financial management and award administration, please contact the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one payment system available for accessing federal award funds\u2014the Grant Payment Request\nSystem (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables recipients to use a secure Internet connection to request\nfunds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States Department\nof the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the primary system\nthat agencies use for EFT. An award recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made since July\n2009.",

For more information regarding GPRS, please visit the following website to view the GPRS User Guide:\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm. Setting up your account How do we set up a new GPRS account? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s) will be\nresponsible for requesting federal funds for your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The individual(s)\nselected must click on the following link and register with the GPRS system to become a drawdown specialist for\nyour agency: https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome. Once you have been approved, you will receive an e-mail containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement\nexecutive and/or government executive or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process. All individuals that need access to GPRS must register separately and\ncreate their own unique GPRS username account, as these accounts are not meant to be shared. How do we add an award to an existing GPRS account? If you are currently registered for an active COPS Office award username in GPRS and would like to add a recently\nfunded COPS Office award number to your existing COPS Office award username, contact the COPS Office GPRS\nregistration team via e-mail at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 User name (for COPS Office awards) First/last name\nVendor number (as listed on your award document)\nAward number(s) to be added 52 How do we fill out the payment enrollment forms? If you are a new award recipient to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment enrollment form (SF-3881). This form can be found on the\nCOPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf. Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 Your agency must complete the \u201cPayee/Company Information\u201d section following the directions on the back of the\nform and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial institution must\ncomplete the \u201cFinancial Institution Information\u201d section and have the appropriate financial official sign the form. If you are already a COPS Office award recipient, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long as\nyour OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment form\ninformation, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Financial Analyst.

When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? Current regulations state that once you return a signed award document, your agency is required to submit a\nFederal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) at the end of every calendar quarter regardless of\naward activity. This report should reflect actual expenditures and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency\non a cumulative basis. You will not be able to make drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 report for\nthe most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Recipients are\nencouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see the section in this\nmanual titled \u201cReports.\u201d Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. 53 There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the recipient\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4. is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\nmaintains excess cash on hand;\ndoes not adhere to the terms and conditions of the award;\nfails to submit reliable or timely reports. How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements; however, your reimbursement\nrequests should cover a specific time frame and include only costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM). As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once. Can we earn interest on our award funds? For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified at 31\nC.F.R. Part 205 \u2018\u2018Rules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers\u2019\u2019 and TFM 4A\u20132000 Overall\nDisbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies. For nonfederal entities other than states, payment methods must minimize the time between your drawdown of\nfederal funds and your payment of award costs to avoid earning excess interest on your award funds.",

These records must include both federal\nfunds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for\nthe funds awarded. As required by 2.C.F.R. \u00a7 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your\naccounting system should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the\nfollowing objectives for federal awards:\n\u2022 Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. \u2022 Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. \u2022 Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your CPD award.",

Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your CPD award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your CPD award (including payroll, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, and purchase orders) must be retained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 C.F.R \u00a7C.F.R. \u00a7 200.333 (Retention requirements\nfor records). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever you\nfind more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving these records has been\nstarted before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These\nrecords should be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to\nmaintain adequate records to document award expenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds\nthat cannot be supported with appropriate records. 55 What if we have more than one award? If your agency has more than one COPS Office award or an award from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization from the\nCOPS Office, or in the case of an award from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your accounting\nsystems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the US Department of Justice, the Comptroller\nGeneral of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may access these\nrecords for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 56 VI. Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The\ntwo primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and US Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving federal\nfinancial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on June 26,\n2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and reporting\nrequirements.",

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 C.F.R. Part 200\u2014Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) on\nDecember 26, 2013. This guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments awarded on or after\nDecember 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of SAA requirements. 2\nC.F.R. Part 200, Subpart F \u2013 Audit Requirements, available at www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text- idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl, establishes the requirements for organizational audits\nthat apply to COPS Office award recipients. Recipients must arrange for the required organization-wide (not\naward-by-award) audit in accordance with the requirements of Subpart F. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.514 (Scope of audit) except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit is\nto express opinions on the recipient\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and nonmajor award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address specific\ncompliance issues with respect to COPS Office award requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, federal\nagencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in \u00a7200.338 Remedies for\nnoncompliance. See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.505. These sanctions under 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.338 could include the following:\n\u2022 Temporarily withholding cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or\nmore severe enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. \u2022 Disallowing (that is, denying both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of\nthe activity or action not in compliance. \u2022 Wholly or partly suspending or terminating the federal award. 57 \u2022 Initiating suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 C.F.R. part 180 and federal awarding\nagency regulations (or in the case of a pass-through entity, recommending such a proceeding be initiated by a\nfederal awarding agency). \u2022 Withholding further federal awards for the project or program. \u2022 Taking other remedies that may be legally available.

Questions and comments regarding SAA audits may be\ndirected to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the OIG for award audits? The OIG is a separate component of the US Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits are\ndesigned to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on an\nannual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the\nOIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the geographical distribution of\nawards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and expired), and type of award (hiring\nand nonhiring). As such, the fact that a recipient has been selected for an OIG audit is not necessarily indicative of\na suspected concern or problem area. 58 What are the steps in an OIG audit? The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Audit Liaison Section serves as the liaison between recipients and the\nOIG\u2019s Audit Division, which conducts the audit.

Questions and comments regarding the\nadministration of your COPS Office CPD award, not specifically related to an audit, should be referred to your COPS\nOffice Program Manager. Typical audit findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to awards as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems:\n\u2022 Unallowable costs. Recipient incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget or a budget\nmodification, were in excess of the approved budget, or were charged to the award after the expiration date\nand an award extension was not obtained. \u2022 Unsupported costs. Specific award expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by adequate\ndocumentation (including but not limited to receipts or purchase orders), that may have been allowable\nunder the program, but for which no prior written approval was obtained from the COPS Office , or award\nexpenditures were in excess of actual approved award costs. \u2022 Lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Recipient failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. \u2022 Funds to better use. Funds could be used more efficiently based on management actions such as reductions\nin outlays; deobligation of funds; withdrawal; costs not incurred by implementing recommended\nimprovements; and other identified savings. 59 \u2022 Questioned costs. Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted from a\nviolation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, award terms and conditions, or other\ndocument governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable and do not\nreflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because costs at the time\nof the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. \u2022 Policy and procedure. Weaknesses are identified in a recipient\u2019s accounting practices, fiscal stewardship,\naccuracy of data used in the development of the award applications, and/or inventory controls that led to the\nrecommendation cited in the audit. The recipient is required to develop or revise policies and/or procedures\nconsistent with their existing practices and submit to the COPS Office to forward to the OIG to close the\nrecommendation. After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Audit Liaison Section\nwill continue working as the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings.",

      "content": "After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Audit Liaison Section\nwill continue working as the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The\nCOPS Office will issue a closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must keep\nall documentation related to the audit for a period of three years following the audit\u2019s closure. 60 VII. Reports Requirement As a CPD award recipient, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Programmatic Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CPD award\nfunding separately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal awards) to ensure accurate\nfinancial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial internal\ncontrols in place to monitor the use of CPD funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms and\nconditions. Good stewardship in this area includes written accounting practices, and use of an accounting system\nthat tracks all award drawdowns and expenditures, and the ability to track when CPD award-funded positions are\nfilled or approved purchases are made. Failure to submit complete reports or submit them in a timely manner may\nresult in the suspension and possible termination of your agency\u2019s COPS Office award funding or other remedial\nactions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit a quarterly Federal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the\naward period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period\nand the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to\ndraw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however, you will have a 90-day\ngrace period after the award end date during which you can draw down funds for eligible expenditures incurred\nbefore the award end date. How do we file Federal Financial Reports? All COPS Office award recipients are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Recipients are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office Agency Portal\nwebsite at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov to log in; once you are logged in, select \u201cApplications\u201d from the agency\nportal menu, click on the \u201cSF-425\u201d icon, and follow the instructions to complete and submit your reports. The\nonline SF-425 requires the same reporting information as the paper version. The use of this online application\nenables authorized users to view past reports and allows them to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports due? SF-425s for COPS Office awards must be submitted every quarter and no later than 30 days after the last day of\neach reporting quarter, as detailed in table 1:\nTable 1. Due dates of SF-425 by quarter\nSF-425 due date\nApril 30\nJuly 30\nOctober 30\nJanuary 30 Reporting quarter\nJanuary 1\u2013March 31\nApril 1\u2013June 30\nJuly 1\u2013September 30\nOctober 1\u2013December 31",

You are required\nto submit an SF-425 even if you have not spent any money or incurred any costs during a reporting period. The\ndue dates for online filing of SF-425s are the same as for the submission of paper copies. Example: If your award start date is 02-01-17 and the current date is 04-15-17, then your first SF-425 will be due no later\nthan 04-30-17 and will cover the period 02-01-17 (award start date) through 03-31-17 (end of the most recent\nreporting quarter). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office so that you can successfully complete a\ndrawdown of funds through GPRS. Award recipients who do not submit an SF-425 report by the due date each quarter will be unable to draw down\nfunds. The payment system contains a function which checks for SF-425 delinquency and will reject a drawdown\nattempt if the SF-425 is not current.

When the Award Period Has Ended At the end of your agency\u2019s CPD award period, the COPS Office is responsible for the closeout of your award. As\npart of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation demonstrating that your agency has met all of the\nprogrammatic and financial requirements of the award. After the end of the award period, your agency will be asked to submit a Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425)\nand any applicable final programmatic progress reports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) for your award is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after the\nend date of the award period. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal expenditures\nthat were incurred during the life of the award, as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. The\nfederal funds expended should reflect only the actual allowable costs incurred relative to the specific program\nrequirements for that award. In addition, once you have completed your final drawdown, this report should\nreconcile with the total amount of federal funds drawn down by your agency. The final SF-425 should also include\nthe required minimum total amount of local (recipient) cash match contributed, if applicable. When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency has incurred but not\nyet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the award period to request reimbursement for eligible\nfunds obligated. Please be advised that 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.343(a) requires recipients to submit final SF-425s and 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.343(b)\nrequires recipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of\nthe award. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have unobligated and unspent award funds remaining in your account following\nthe award period due to an overestimate of item costs during the application period.",

Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages interactive\npartnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these partnerships can be\nused to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through collaborative problem\nsolving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and addressing public safety\nproblems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify community\nconcerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies, prosecutors, probation\nand parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies, health and human\nservices departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific goals at\ntown hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the community,\nand team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its behalf\ncan be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share common\ninterests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups, advocacy\ngroups, community development corporations, and the faith community. 76 Institutions of Higher Education\nInstitutions of higher education create communities of students, professors, and personnel that are important\nstakeholders. The institutions can also provide resources to law enforcement agencies by assisting with\ncommunication strategies, facilitation of community meetings, data analysis, and research. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because they\noften bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify\nproblems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and community\noutreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating information about\npolice and business partnerships and initiatives, and crime prevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community agencies\nor new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on public\nperceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how the\ninfrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages the\napplication of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness.",

      "content": "The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how the\ninfrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages the\napplication of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the entire\ndepartment, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem solving\nand partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and communication that\ntake place within agencies to support this orientation. 77 Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing, and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of doing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part of\nthe process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor groups\nin agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing implementation. Decision making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision making. Decentralized\ndecision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision making\ninvolves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving efforts, and\nallowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various\nresources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community\nwill help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan is to\nhave value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their\nefforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and values statement should be\nsimple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures,\nwhere appropriate. Organizational evaluations",

      "content": "Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures,\nwhere appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime rates)\ncommunity policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include such things as greater\ncommunity satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks at not only how\noutcomes are measured, but also at how feedback information is used. 78 Transparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the\ncommunity is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant information on\ncrime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local patrol officers have decisionmaking authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term assignments, the\ndevelopment of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or\nareas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance customer service and facilitate more contact between\npolice and the community, thus establishing a strong relationships and mutual accountability. Patrol beat\nboundaries should be aligned to neighborhood boundaries to enhance officers\u2019 understanding of communities\nwithin their patrol areas and to build trust within the community. Other community policing partners should\nbecome familiar with both the patrol officers and community policing officers assigned within each patrol beat to\ncoordinate government and nongovernment community policing activities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers have to be able to handle multiple responsibilities and take a team\napproach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the community. Community policing encourages its\nadoption agency-wide, not just by special units, although there may be a need for specialist units that are tasked\nwith identifying and solving particularly complex problems or managing complex partnerships. Resources (time, finances, and people) Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources and the investment of time to support\ncommunity policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained and\neffective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency\nincluding recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from sworn officers to\ncivilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be aligned with the agencies\u2019\ncommunity policing views. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment, selection,\nand hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving responsibilities\nand encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service instead of only a spirit of adventure.

Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving responsibilities\nand encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service instead of only a spirit of adventure. A 79 community policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it looks for recruits, whom it is recruiting and\nhiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community involvement in this process\nthrough the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations\nSupervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are incorporated\ninto job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional procedures should support sound problem-solving\nactivities, proactive policing, community collaboration, and community satisfaction with police services. Training\nTraining at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles and tactics. It\nalso needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to identify and\ncorrect conditions that could lead to crime, raise public awareness, and engage the community in finding solutions\nto problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving and help\nofficers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized within the\norganization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information technology systems\nCommunity policing is highly information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in providing ready access to\nquality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective and ensures\nthat officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their patrol beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with accessing information to provide vital resources, improving\ntwo-way communication with community members, and developing agency accountability systems and\nperformance outcome measures. Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the public and\ninternally within their organization. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages agencies to\ndevelop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports; reverse 911; e-mail\nalerts; Internet social media discussion forums; and feedback on interactive applications (such as surveys and\ngeographical information), thereby creating open, ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters, e-mail and\nenhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other entities for more\nefficient operations. Community policing also encourages the use of technology to develop accountability and\nperformance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a broad array of measures\nand information. Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely information\non crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers in their patrol cars or\nthrough personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem analysis functions by enabling\nagencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime locations, and quality-of-life\nconcerns, and to further enhance analysis. 80 Quality and accuracy of data",

Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information from various\nsources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked to one another and\nchecked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance\nmeasurement. Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions\nto the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused\ninto all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about\ntheir responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A major conceptual\nvehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way is the SARA\n(scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the\nscope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the\nselected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents similar\nin one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a\nplace, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from\nthe community, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding of\nthe dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish correlation,\nand develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to find out as much\nas possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?, when?, where?, how?, why?, and why\nnot? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an identified\nproblem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response should follow\nlogically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific problem.",

The response should follow\nlogically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific problem. The goals\nof the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially reducing the problem or\nreducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of community cohesion. 81 Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but also\ngathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process, outcomes,\nor both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis should be\nreviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and tested. The\nentire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear, meaning that additional scanning, analysis, or\nresponses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim, offender,\nand location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for example, capable\nguardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders (e.g., parents, friends,\nand probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees, and motel clerks). Rather\nthan focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the police focus on the factors that are within\ntheir reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating\nrisk with unwanted behavior.

Conference and Event Guidance\nConference and Event Approval, Planning, and Reporting FAQ\nPrior Approval\n1. Approximately how long should it take to adequately complete the Conference & Events Submission form? The amount of time required to adequately complete the Conference & Events Submission Form will vary\ndepending on the complexity of the proposed event. A small event (in terms of number of attendees, total\ncost, etc.) may require only an hour or two to complete the form because the event is basic/routine and data\nare not required in all of the available categories. On the other hand, a large event (in terms of number of\nattendees, multiple sessions occurring at the same time, etc.) may require several hours or days depending on\nthe amount of required data (categories) and level of justi\ufb01cation needed to support the event. Regardless of\nthe size of any event, the supporting justi\ufb01cation should be su\ufb03cient to support the agency\u2019s mission for\nconducting the event. 2. Which types of events do not require prior approval? Currently there are six types of events that do not require prior approval:\ni.\nii.\niii. iv. v.\nvi. 3. Conferences held by grant recipients. (Note: Conferences held by cooperative agreement recipients do\nrequire prior approval.) Law enforcement operational activities, including staging, surveillance, investigation, intelligence, and\nundercover activities. Routine operational meetings (e.g., sta\ufb00 meetings or all-hands meetings) if held in a federal facility, if held\nby cooperative agreement recipients in a non-federal facility that does not charge for its use, and if there\nare neither costs to the DOJ for logistical conference planning nor government-provided food or\nbeverages. In all three of these instances, the answer to all the questions on the Prior Approval Not\nRequired Checklist must be \u201cNo.\u201d Site visits are considered routine operational meetings regardless of\nlocation so long as there are no costs to the DOJ for meeting rooms, logistical conference planning, or\nfood and beverages. Testing activities where the primary purpose of the event is to evaluate an applicant\u2019s quali\ufb01cations to\nperform certain duties necessary to his or her job. This includes \ufb01rearms and weaponry pro\ufb01ciency testing\nand certi\ufb01cations. A majority of the event must be devoted to administering and taking the test. Testing\nactivities that are incidental to a training course or conference or are given upon its completion do require\nprior approval. Video conferences and webinars where there are neither costs to the DOJ for logistical conference\nplanning nor government-provided food or beverages. Technical assistance visits where travel was made by an individual or a small group of project sta\ufb00\nmembers to provide training or technical assistance to a particular entity; in this instance, the answer to\nall the questions on the Prior Approval Not Required Checklist must be \u201cNo.\u201d Where should time staff spent working on the conference that is not related to planning be captured?",

      "content": "Where should time staff spent working on the conference that is not related to planning be captured? Time spent working on a conference by sta\ufb00 or contractors can be classi\ufb01ed as either logistical planning time\nor programmatic planning time. Programmatic planning includes time spent on activities such as developing\nthe conference content and agenda, identifying and recruiting subject matter experts, and preparing written 84 materials. Logistical planning includes time spent on tasks such as selecting a venue, ordering and setting up\naudio-video equipment, securing hotel rooms, processing registrations, providing onsite support during the\nevent, and undertaking other non-programmatic functions. 4. If a cooperative agreement recipient or contractor is able to obtain a no-cost site for the event, are we still\nrequired to look into other facilities and provide justi\ufb01cation for not selecting the other facilities? Yes. Cooperative agreement recipients and contractors should compare three or more facilities in a location. Facilities being compared should have provided a cost estimate and be able to accommodate the event as\ndetailed in the requirements. A desired hotel may o\ufb00er an incentive of no overall facility cost (e.g., for meeting\nrooms or audio-visual equipment) but may not be economical in other cost comparison items such as the\navailability of lodging at per diem rates, travel distance for attendees, etc. Also, recipients and contractors\nshould maintain written documentation justifying their decision to select the chosen location in the event of a\nfuture audit. 5. Is there a timeframe after the COPS O\ufb03ce accepts a conference request that a cooperative agreement\nrecipient or contractor can expect noti\ufb01cation of approval? Each event request (meeting, conference, webinar, etc.) is unique in reference to how it will accomplish the\nCOPS O\ufb03ce\u2019s mission. The key to any conference request moving through the review process depends on\nwhether the package is complete. A complete package contains a detailed cost analysis and su\ufb03cient\njusti\ufb01cation to support all categories within the package. Example: An event is submitted for approval and consists of the following categories: printing and distribution,\nmeals and incidental expenses (M&IE), lodging, transportation, and trainer or facilitator costs. The package\ncontains a detailed cost analysis of each cost category (e.g., one trainer at $450 per day x 2 days = $900) and\nadequate justi\ufb01cation explaining the purpose of the event and the role of the trainer. This package can move\nthrough the review process in a few days and allow ample time for travelers to make reservations, if the\npackage was submitted within the required timeframe. However, if the trainer or facilitator\u2019s costs in the\nsubmitted package exceed the COPS O\ufb03ce\u2019s threshold and if supporting justi\ufb01cation was not included, a delay\nmay occur while this justi\ufb01cation is being retrieved. To avoid delays in the approval process, all recipients and contractors should adhere to the timeframe\nrequirements for the dollar amount of their proposed event. 6. Once an event is approved, how do we handle any increases or decreases in the amount of attendees\noriginally proposed on the cost analysis spreadsheet submitted to the DOJ for approval?",

Once an event is approved, how do we handle any increases or decreases in the amount of attendees\noriginally proposed on the cost analysis spreadsheet submitted to the DOJ for approval? After receiving noti\ufb01cation of approval from the COPS Office, all subsequent changes prior to the start day of\nthe event should be sent to the COPS O\ufb03ce Conference Costs email address, as appropriate. Example: If the\nCOPS Office approved on 9/1/2017 an event scheduled for 12/15/2017, the cooperative agreement recipient\nor contractor should notify the COPS Office of any changes in attendees as soon as possible (preferably 30\ndays or more in advance). This scenario holds true for changes to the start and end date, location, and any\nother cost-related category. 7. Does the $25 per person per day limit for meeting rooms and audio-visual costs also include service fees and\ntaxes? Yes. The cost allowed for conference space and audio-visual equipment and services (fees and taxes) is limited\nto $25 per day per attendee and is not to exceed a cumulative total cost of $20,000. Total costs are de\ufb01ned as\ndirect and indirect costs. 85 8. What if there are multiple meetings occurring within the larger event o\ufb00ered to all the attendees? Is the\n$25 per day per attendee limit applicable to each meeting? Example: A general session meeting contains all\nattendees and later breakout sessions are o\ufb00ered to the groups. Can each breakout session have its own\n$25 per person per day limit? No. Despite the multiple meetings o\ufb00ered within the larger event, the COPS Office considers and approves\nthis type of situation to be a single event. 9. Can we accept complimentary food and beverage? Yes. Complimentary food and beverages may be accepted if o\ufb00ered to everyone. Example: Hotel W o\ufb00ers a\ncomplimentary continental breakfast to all its overnight customers regardless of any status they may have\nwith the hotel chain. This type of complimentary o\ufb00er is considered a business strategy of the hotel to\npromote an increase in overnight stays. You are not required to reduce your M&IE by the value of the food\nand beverage it o\ufb00ered to all customers as noted in this example. 10. Are the thresholds ($8,750 for logistical planner, $35,000 for programmatic planner, and $20,000 for\nconference space and audio-visual equipment and services) a cumulative cost for the entire event or a per\nday cost? The cost allowed for conference space and audio-visual equipment and services (fees and taxes) is limited to\n$25 per day per attendee and is not to exceed a cumulative total cost of $20,000. The cost allowed for a\nlogistical planner is the lesser of $50 per attendee or $8,750 per event. The cost allowed for a programmatic\nplanner is the lesser of $200 per attendee or $35,000 per event. 11. To whom should I submit event requests? For all COPS O\ufb03ce events, the form should be sent to the COPS Office Conference Costs email address. Please\ndo not send questions or other correspondence to this email address.

How far in advance do I have to submit an event for review and approval? Requests for conferences costing $100,000 or less, and not exceeding any cost thresholds (conference space\nand audio-visual equipment and services, logistical conference planner, and programmatic conference\nplanner), must be submitted to the COPS Office 90 calendar days in advance of the earliest of the following:\n\u2022 Start date of the conference;\n\u2022 Deadline for signing conference-related contracts; or\n\u2022 Obligation of funds for conference costs (except for minimal costs required to assemble and submit the\napproval request). Requests for conferences costing more than $100,000, or exceeding any one cost threshold (conference space\nand audio-visual equipment and services, logistical conference planner, or programmatic conference planner),\nmust be submitted to the COPS Office 120 calendar days in advance of the earliest of the following:\n\u2022 Start date of the conference;\n\u2022 Deadline for signing conference-related contracts; or\n\u2022 Obligation of funds for conference costs (except for minimal costs required to assemble and submit the\napproval request). If approval requests are submitted less than the required number of days in advance (as noted above), the\nCOPS O\ufb03ce, in its sole discretion, may consider the late requests but cannot ensure the requests will receive a\ndecision in time to avoid having to cancel the conference (particularly if any issues arise with speci\ufb01c items of\ncost in the request). Cancellation costs associated with conference requests that are submitted for late prior\napproval may be determined to be unallowable costs by the COPS Office. 86 13. What are the most common mistakes made on the forms so that I can avoid them in the future and increase\nthe likelihood of a quick review and approval decision for my event? Below are the most common mistakes found:\n\u2022 Inaccurate calculation of daily per diem. Daily per diem rates for locations across the nation can be found on\nthe GSA website. Ensure the daily rate used in the calculations corresponds to the speci\ufb01c location and dates\nof the meeting. In addition, remember that travel days are reimbursed at a slightly lower rate than meeting\ndays. The lower rates must be used for days of travel both before and after the event. The following chart\nincludes these lower rates: Full per diem rate Corresponding travel day rate (75%) $46.00 $34.50 $51.00 $38.25 $56.00 $42.00 $61.00 $45.75 $66.00 $49.50 $71.00 $53.25 EXCEPTION: If your organization has its own formal, written travel policy, your event submissions can\nre\ufb02ect that policy instead of the rates in the chart above. In these instances, state that you have a formal,\nwritten travel policy, and clearly explain the rates in the policy and how the corresponding numbers in\nyour submission were derived. \u2022 Insu\ufb03cient explanation and justi\ufb01cation of transportation costs.

Remember to break out and brie\ufb02y describe\nand justify the transportation costs that are included. Example: If participants are \ufb02ying to your event and the\ntickets are being paid for with DOJ funding, you should include the anticipated number of people \ufb02ying\nmultiplied by the estimated cost per ticket. If cars will be rented, you should include a brief justi\ufb01cation for\nwhy rental cars are being used instead of another form of ground transportation, such as taxis or shuttles. \u2022 Insu\ufb03cient explanation and justi\ufb01cation of audio-visual costs. All audio-visual costs should be broken out and\nbrie\ufb02y described. The quantity of equipment to be rented (number of microphones, projectors, etc.) should\nbe included, along with relevant costs and a brief justi\ufb01cation for why the proposed equipment is required to\nconduct a successful meeting. A discussion of how the audio-visual services provider was selected should be\nincluded (for example, did you obtain three quotes?). \u2022 Insu\ufb03cient explanation and justi\ufb01cation of printing costs. Proposed printing costs for participant materials\nshould also be itemized and brie\ufb02y described. Speci\ufb01cally, it is important to articulate why printed materials\nare needed instead of making materials available electronically (at low or no cost) to attendees before or\nafter the event. \u2022 Insu\ufb03cient explanation and justi\ufb01cation of shipping costs. Provide an itemization of these costs, along with a\nbrief description of why the equipment and other materials being shipped are essential to hosting a\nsuccessful conference. \u2022 Insu\ufb03cient explanation and justi\ufb01cation of consultant costs. The maximum daily rate for subject matter\nexperts who are being reimbursed for their time is noted here. Describe all consultant costs in detail, and\ninclude a brief yet compelling justi\ufb01cation for the proposed costs. Daily rates for subject matter experts 87 above the maximum daily rate require prior approval by the COPS O\ufb03ce and DOJ. In cases where higher rates\nare included in the event submission, written documentation of prior approval is required and should be\nattached. 14. Should I continue to exclude all food and beverage costs in my event submissions? Yes. The inclusion of food and beverage costs will delay the review process, and these costs are not likely to be\napproved. The only exception is when the location of the conference does not allow attendees to obtain food\nor beverages on their own or when this restriction would greatly disrupt the conference schedule. If you\nbelieve your event quali\ufb01es for such a rare exception, contact your Program Manager to discuss it before\ncompleting and submitting your form. If meals are included in your event submission, remember that\nattendees must subtract the meal costs from the M&IE reimbursement for the days on which the meals will\noccur. 15. Can you summarize what I can do to prevent follow-up questions about my submitted events that delay the\nreview and approval process? As a general rule, explain how you derived every cost that you include in the conference submission form.",

As a general rule, explain how you derived every cost that you include in the conference submission form. For\nlines that do not provide space for you to add descriptive narrative, include your explanations and speci\ufb01c cost\nbreakdowns in a separate tab or in a separate document that is submitted with the form. In addition, include\nthe cooperative agreement or contract number on the form. 16. What events qualify for the expedited review process? There is no expedited review process. Every e\ufb00ort is made to review all events as quickly as possible. Most delays result from a need for additional information. Event requests are prioritized for review by\nbalancing the following three criteria:\n\u2022 The start date of the event;\n\u2022 The date the event submission was received by COPS O\ufb03ce; and\n\u2022 The overall cost and complexity of the event. For example, conferences requiring approval by the assistant\nattorney general\u2019s administration and the deputy attorney general (over $100,000\u2013$250,000) typically take\nlonger to process, as they must go through COPS O\ufb03ce and DOJ reviews, result in more questions, and are\nmore likely to have issues related to cost thresholds. Reporting\n17. Where can I \ufb01nd the most updated version of the conference reporting form to use for my submissions? The most updated version of the conference reporting form can be found under the Training Resources for\naward recipients section on the COPS Office Training page at https://cops.usdoj.gov/training. 18. If I have a question about conference reporting, to whom should I send it? Send your questions to your designated Program Manager. They are great resources and will be happy to\nassist you. 19. Are we expected to have our sta\ufb00 track their time hour for hour for time spent on the event for planning,\netc., or are reasonable estimates adequate for cost reporting purposes? Post-event reports must contain actual costs, not estimates. These costs should include logistical and\nprogrammatic planner sta\ufb00 time spent on these activities and any contracted planner costs. 88 With conference cost reports now being due 30 days after the event, how should we handle costs for\ninvoices that have not been received yet? Many invoices (such as for hotels) are not received within 30 days\nafter the event. Should estimates be included on the cost report? All conference costs for events held by cooperative agreement recipients or contractors costing more than\n$20,000, or where more than 50% of attendees are DOJ employees, must be reported within 45 calendar days\nafter the last day of the event. 20. On the DOJ Conference & Events Submission Form under \u201cA. General Conference Information,\u201d is item 19,\n\u201cReporting Period,\u201d the period in which the actual cost of the event is being reported, or should this be\nbased on the end date of the event?

An indirect cost rate proposal as defined in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.57\nis the documentation prepared by a nonfederal entity to\nsupport its request for the establishment of an indirect cost\nrate, as described in Appendix III to 2 C.F.R. Part 200,\nIndirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate\nDetermination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs)\nthrough Appendix VII to 2 C.F.R. Part 200, States and Local\nGovernment and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals. What are indirect costs? Indirect Facilities & Administrative (F&A) costs are costs\nincurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more\nthan one cost objective. They are not readily attributable\nto the cost objectives that are being benefited. To facilitate\nequitable distribution of indirect expenses to the specific\ncost objectives, it may be necessary to establish a number\nof pools of indirect (F&A) costs. Indirect (F&A) cost pools\nmust be distributed to benefited cost objectives on bases\nthat will produce equitable results in consideration of relative\nbenefits derived. 1 1 See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.56 in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit\nRequirements for Federal Awards, as adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 2800.101. Indirect (facilities & administrative (F&A)) costs\nare costs incurred for a common or joint purpose\nbenefiting more than one cost objective. They are\nnot readily attributable to the cost objectives that are\nbeing benefited. There are several types of indirect cost rates:\n\u0084 Final rate is applicable to a specified past period that is\nbased on the actual costs of the period. A final audited\nrate is not subject to adjustment. \u0084 Fixed rate has the same characteristics as a predetermined\nrate except that the difference between estimated costs\nand actual allowable costs of the covered period is carried\nforward as an adjustment for a future period. \u0084 One-time extension allows your agency to apply for a\none-time extension of a negotiated indirect (F&A) cost\nrate. The negotiated cost rate may be extended for up\nto four years. Once your cognizant federal agency has\napproved an extension for indirect costs, you must abide\nby the rate for the agreed-upon time period. No further\nnegotiations regarding indirect cost rates may occur until\nthe extension has expired. At the end of the extension\nperiod, you must negotiate a new indirect cost rate. Indirect Cost Rate \u0084 Predetermined rate is applicable to a specified current\nor future period and is not subject to adjustment. A\npredetermined rate may be used where there is reasonable\nassurance that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based\non the agency\u2019s actual costs. Predetermined rates may not\nbe used by governmental units that have not submitted\nand negotiated the rate with the cognizant federal agency. \u0084 Provisional rate is a temporary rate applicable to a\nspecified time period that is used for funding, interim\nreimbursement, and reporting of indirect costs pending\nestablishment of a final rate for that period. \u0084",

MTDC\ncan include all direct salaries and wages, applicable\nfringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel,\nand up to the first $25,000 of each subaward (regardless\nof the period of performance of the subawards under\nthe award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital\nexpenditures, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships\nand fellowships, participant support costs, and the\nportion of each subaward in excess of $25,000. Other\nitems may only be excluded when necessary to avoid a\nserious inequity in the distribution of indirect costs and\nwith the approval of the cognizant federal agency for\nindirect costs. How does an agency establish an indirect\ncost rate? If your agency does not have a previously established indirect\ncost rate, your agency can obtain a rate by contacting\nyour agency\u2019s cognizant federal agency, which will review\nall documentation and approve a rate for the covered\ntime period. For more information on the requirements\nfor development and submission of indirect (F&A) cost\nrate proposals, please refer to 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.414 (e) and\nAppendices III \u2013 VII to 2 C.F.R. Part 200. 2 What is a cognizant federal agency? Cognizant federal agency for indirect costs as defined in\n2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.19 is the Federal agency responsible for\nreviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation\nplans or indirect cost proposals on behalf of all Federal\nagencies. The cognizant federal agency for indirect cost is\nnot necessarily the same as the cognizant federal agency for\naudit. The COPS Office is not a cognizant federal agency. For nonprofit, state, local, and tribal governments your\ncognizant federal agency is generally the federal agency that\nprovides your organization with the most federal financial\nassistance. For assignments of cognizant federal agencies, see\nthe following:\n(a) For institutions of higher education: Appendix III to\nPart 200\u2014Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and\nAssignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions\nof Higher Education (IHEs), paragraph C.11. (b) For nonprofit organizations: Appendix IV to Part\n200\u2014Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and\nAssignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit\nOrganizations, paragraph C.2.a.\n(c) For state and local governments: Appendix V to\nPart 200\u2014State/Local Government and Indian\nTribe-Wide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans,\nparagraph F.1.\n(d) For Indian tribes: Appendix VII to Part 200\u2014States\nand Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect\nCost Proposal, paragraph D.1. What should an agency do if its indirect cost rate\nexpires or changes during the award period? If your agency\u2019s approved indirect cost rate agreement expires\nduring the award period, a current approved rate agreement\nmust be obtained from the cognizant federal agency and\nsubmitted to the COPS Office. The agency must advise the\nCOPS Office of any changes to its approved indirect cost rate\nduring the award period and, if necessary, request a budget\nmodification that reflects the rate change. Please contact your\nCOPS Office Grant Program Specialist or Program Manager\nto determine when a budget modification is necessary. Indirect\nIndirect Cost Rat\nRate\ne",

Can an agency reprogram indirect costs to\ndirect costs? Reprogramming requests of indirect costs to direct costs are\nadministered through the budget modification process for\nthe specific COPS Office award that your agency received. Please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist\nor Program Manager to obtain guidance on any additional\nrequirements that may apply to your modification request. The COPS Office will then evaluate your request and notify\nyou, in writing, of our decision. Please be advised that if your agency\u2019s revised indirect cost\nrate is lower than the rate approved at the time of award\nand a formal budget modification was not approved, excess\nindirect cost rate funds should not be drawn down and will\nbe deobligated at closeout. What should an agency expect at the end of the\naward period regarding its indirect costs rate? If a provisional indirect cost rate is in effect at award\ncloseout, the recipient shall proceed with closeout but\nwill complete an expenditure analysis upon receipt of\nthe approved final indirect cost rate to determine if an\nadjustment is necessary. If the recipient drew down excess\nCOPS Office funding for indirect costs, the recipient must\nreturn the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a\nrevised Federal Financial Report (SF-425). If the recipient\nincurred additional indirect costs, the recipient may request\na budget modification if the award is still open and award\nfunds are available. If the recipient returns or draws down\nCOPS Office funding, the recipient will need to submit a\nrevised final Federal Financial Report (SF-425). 3 Other important factors To support the indirect cost rate agreement, recipients are\nresponsible for ensuring independent audits are conducted\nin accordance with existing federal auditing and reporting\nstandards set forth in 2 C.F.R. Part 200, Subpart F - Audit\nRequirements. A copy of the audit report must be submitted\nto the cognizant federal agency to support the indirect cost\nrate agreement. In accordance with ensuring proper award management and\nuse of funding awarded through the COPS Office, recipients\nmay be selected for a site visit or an enhanced office-based\ngrant review (EOBGR) or may need to address an alleged\nnoncompliance complaint during a compliance review by the\nCOPS Office Grant Monitoring Division. Therefore, recipients must adhere to proper accounting\npractices and recordkeeping to ensure all necessary\ndocumentation is available for review if requested by the\nCOPS Office. Noncompliance may result in the repayment\nof misused funds, suspension of funds, or other remedial\nactions available by law until the noncompliance is resolved. Contact the COPS Office If you have any questions regarding the federal requirements\nthat guide indirect cost rates, please refer to the applicable COPS\nOffice Award Owner\u2019s Manual or contact your COPS Office Grant\nProgram Specialist or Program Manager.",

May 2017 U.S. Department of Justice\nOffice of Community Oriented Policing Services Fact Sheet www.cops.usdoj.gov Budget Modifications for CPD Awardees Under federal regulations, you are required to expend federal\nfunds only as approved in your federal clearance memo\n(FCM). The COPS Office realizes that agencies may need\nto reprogram award funds and has provided this fact sheet\nfor CPD awardees to assist with the process. Awardees may\nreprogram up to a total of 10 percent of their entire budget\n(over the course of the award) without submitting a formal\nbudget modification. However, awardees should notify their\nCOPS Office program manager (PM) prior to any repro\u00ad\ngramming of funds regardless of whether a formal budget\nmodification is needed. Once the reprogramming of funds\nreaches 10 percent of the award, your agency must submit\na formal budget modification requesting approval from\nthe COPS Office for any additional budget modification\nrequests. Starting with 2016 funding, any awards under\n$150,000 do not require formal budget modifications;\nhowever, the awardee should communicate reprogramming\nas needed with the COPS Office PM. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered\nwithin the scope of the original award. Any funds that are\nbeing requested to account for a change in scope from the\noriginal funded project must first receive approval from the\nCOPS Office to expand or change the scope. Be advised that\nreprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved. The COPS Office will not approve any modifica\u00ad\ntion request that results in an increase of federal funds. Starting with 2017 funding, if a budget modification\ninvolves making a new subaward to a State or local govern\u00ad\nment entity, the awardee and its intended subrecepient are\nrequired to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373 regard\u00ad\ning prohibitions or restrictions on sending to, requesting or\nreceiving from, maintaining, or exchanging information on\ncitizenship or immigration status, including any prohibi\u00ad\ntions or restrictions imposed or established by a State or\nlocal government entity or official. For information about\nthe applicable form and how to certify, please contact your\nCOPS Office PM. What to do if you need\na budget modification If your budget requires a modification, please follow\nthese steps:\n1. Contact your PM and discuss the modification and reasoning for the change in budget. This process\nmay require back and forth discussion and further\ndocumentation. 2.

The awardee\nwill have to reenter the system, make the budget adjust\u00ad\nments where necessary, and resubmit the saved changes. 2\nOnce the budget modification has been programmatically\napproved, a BA is assigned. The BA will review the modifi\u00ad\ncation to ensure the budget is allowable and meets all\nregulations and policies. The BA will work with the PM\nfor any points of clarification, changes, or justification.

The guidance provides recommendations to recipients seeking funding for interoperable\nemergency communications projects, including allowable costs, items to consider when funding emergency\ncommunications projects, awards management best practices for emergency communications awards, and\ninformation on standards that ensure greater interoperability. The guidance is intended to ensure that federally\nfunded investments are compatible and support national goals and objectives for improving interoperability\nnationwide. Recipients (including sub-recipients) that are using CPD funds to support emergency communications\nactivities should comply with the latest version of SAFECOM Guidance, including provisions on technical standards\nthat ensure and enhance interoperable communications. The most recent version of SAFECOM guidance is\navailable at www.safecomprogram.gov/grant/Default.aspx. System for Award Management (SAM). The SAM database is the repository for standard information about\nfederal financial assistance applicants, recipients, and sub-recipients. Organizations that have previously submitted\napplications via Grants.gov are already registered with SAM, as it is a requirement for Grants.gov registration.

For the purposes of your COPS Office CPD award, supplanting means replacing state, local, or Bureau\nof Indian Affairs (BIA) funds that otherwise would have been spent on award purposes with federal COPS Office\nfunds. State, local, and tribal governments are prohibited from supplanting throughout the award period. This\nmeans that your agency may not use COPS Office funds to pay for any equipment/technology, services, personnel,\nor other items which, in the absence of the COPS Office program, would otherwise have been funded with state or\nlocal funds or with funds supplied by the BIA. The COPS Office funds must instead be used to supplement, or\nincrease, your budget on award purposes.
