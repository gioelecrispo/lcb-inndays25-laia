The 2015 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) is\ndesigned to advance public safety by providing funding directly to state law enforcement agencies in\nstates with high seizures of precursor chemicals, finished methamphetamine, laboratories, and laboratory\ndump seizures for the purpose of locating and investigating illicit activities, including precursor diversion,\nlaboratories, or methamphetamine traffickers. CAMP funding may be used to locate or investigate illicit activities, including precursor diversion,\nlaboratories, or methamphetamine traffickers. Funding under this program is not available for\nmethamphetamine laboratory cleanup, treatment programs, or prosecution of methamphetaminerelated activities. The allowable uses of your agency\u2019s CAMP grant are specified on the CAMP Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM). If your agency\u2019s local fiscal conditions have changed since submitting the FY 2015\nCAMP application and your agency wishes to modify its CAMP grant to reprogram awarded funding into a\ndifferent hiring funding category, please refer to grant condition #6 on page 10 of this manual for detailed\ninformation on requesting a post-award grant modification. This CAMP Grant Owner\u2019s Manual will assist your agency with the administrative and financial matters\nassociated with your grant. It was developed by the COPS Office to ensure that all CAMP grantees clearly\nunderstand and meet the requirements of their grant.

Please do not hesitate to call the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 if you need assistance with the implementation of your grant.

If this information is incorrect or has changed, please update your agency contacts online at\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link.

The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed\nfor any allowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your CAMP grant award is two years\n(24 months). Your grant number is in the following format: 2015-AMWX-0000 for grants awarded in Fiscal Year (FY)\n2015. The COPS Office tracks grant information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have\nyour agency\u2019s grant number (or your agency\u2019s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the\nCOPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five\nnumbers or letters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for\nuse in tracking information for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic grant\ninformation based upon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI,\nthe COPS Office assigns a non-official ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two\ncharacters will be \u201cZZ\u201d). If you have any questions regarding your grant, please refer to your grant number or\nyour agency\u2019s ORI number when you contact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency\u2019s nine- or\nthirteen-digit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).",

Allowable costs\nCondition: The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs for activities related to the establishment\nand enhancement of a variety of problem-solving strategies to investigate methamphetamine problems in your\njurisdiction. The allowable costs for which your agency\u2019s grant has been approved are limited to those listed on\nthe Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which is included in your agency\u2019s award package. The Financial\nClearance Memorandum FCM specifies the costs that your agency is allowed to fund with your CAMP grant award,\nand specifies the overall amount approved for each budget request category. Your agency may not use CAMP\naward funds for any costs that are not identified as allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual allowable costs incurred during the grant award period will be eligible for reimbursement and\ndrawdown. If your agency experiences any cost savings over the course of the grant (for example, your grant\napplication overestimated the total entry-level officer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use\nthat excess funding to extend the length of the grant beyond 24 months.",

You may not cancel or postpone spending\nmoney in your budget that is committed to hiring other new officers or civilians. \u2022 You must take expeditious and timely steps to fill any vacancies that were created on or after the date\nof your grant application by retirement, resignation, or other reasons with new officers or civilians other\nthan your COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program positions. Example: If you are redeploying a current employee who would otherwise be paid $75,000 in salary and\nbenefits during the life of the grant project, your agency must continue to pay this employee with local\nfunds. The COPS Office grant funds may be used to backfill the resulting vacancy with a new hire, even\nthough the COPS Office-funded position will not be working directly on the COPS Anti-Methamphetamine\nProgram. Equipment and technology To meet this grant condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Equipment and technology must be purchased on or after the award start date (unless an exception\nis authorized in writing by the COPS Office) and must be in addition to purchases that the grantee is\nobligated or funded to make in the current budget.

Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any state or locally funded partnership\nagencies use COPS Office funds only to supplement, not supplant, their state or local funding as described\nin this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the grant award period to receive additional time to implement your\ngrant program. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Grants may be extended a maximum of 24\nmonths beyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 24 months will be evaluated\non a case-by-case basis. Only those grantees that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted\nno-cost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays,\nor other circumstances that interrupt the 24-month grant funding period. An extension allows your agency to\ncompensate for such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 24 months of funding. Extension\nrequests must be received prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the grant award period require prior written approval from the\nCOPS Office. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding\nfor costs incurred beyond the official grant award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks\nto accommodate reasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the\nCOPS Office grant. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the grant award period to determine\nwhether a no-cost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the grant\nend date. Requests to extend the grant award period must be submitted online and received by the COPS\nOffice before the official grant award end date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will\nonly be considered when the grantee provides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example\nof this would be an instance where an unforeseen natural disaster prevented a grantee from requesting\nan extension. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension by the end date may result in the\nimmediate deobligation of any remaining grant funds. 9 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual Automatic extensions will be granted for grantee requests of six months or less. All extension requests\nbeyond six months will require review and approval by the COPS Office.

The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining\ngrant funds during the closeout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time\nextension, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency\u2019s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS AntiMethamphetamine Program award. Grant modifications under CAMP are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All\nmodification requests involving the purchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office\nprior to their implementation. In addition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification\nrequest that results in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram grant funds. Acceptable examples of such\naward modifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items,\nor purchasing a different type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may\nexpend grant funds only as approved in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Any requests to change or\nalter grant awards require written approval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Without\nprior written approval, you must continue to implement your grant as it was originally awarded and\naccepted by your agency. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved (construction, indirect costs, etc.). What you should do: For all other modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d\nlink in the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office through the Grants\nManagement Portal, providing the proposed changes, details of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific grant modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified grant award\nmay begin following written approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for\nactive grants will often be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes. If applicable, your agency is required to sign and submit the modified award document via the \u201cAccount\nAccess\u201d link to officially accept the grant modification. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS Anti-Methamphetamine\nProgram.

The grantee agrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. 10 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the Attorney General for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nAct. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine what programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may\nassess the way in which your agency implements its CAMP grant. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or\nevaluators may study the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect\ninformation about the programs\u2019 effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In\naddition, they may ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how\nresidents feel about community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be\nuseful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and\ninformation-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information\nabout your grant activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is\nused to track your agency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to\ngauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure\nthe proper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the\nprogress of our programs and grantees. What you should do: This grant condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with\nCAMP grants. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report will be\nrequired to be submitted directly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link of the COPS Office\nwebsite at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports\nusing Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter.",

A final SF-425 will\nbe due within 90 days after the end of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal\nmonies spent, unliquidated obligations incurred, and the unobligated balance of federal funds. Under\nfederal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the\nofficial grant end date; however, you will have a 90-day grace period after the grant award end date during\nwhich you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before the grant end date. Agencies with\nmore than one delinquent programmatic and/or financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject\nto delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to receive technical\nassistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in section VI 11 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual (\u201cReports\u201d) on page 37 of this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid\nsuspension or possible termination of grant funds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required\nreports may also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Grant monitoring activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their grant conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of grant implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring\nprocess coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Grant monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office\ninclude site visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic\nreporting, and audit resolution. As a COPS Office CAMP grantee, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any\nrequests for information pertaining to your grant. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each grant program must\ncontain a monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how grantees are adhering to COPS\nOffice grant requirements and develops the best technical assistance based on this feedback. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an\nentity designated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds, both programmatically\nand financially. The most common ways are as follows:\n\u2022 site visits. The COPS Office conducts grantee site visits to ensure compliance with grant terms\nand conditions. These visits also provide firsthand observation of the grantee\u2019s community policing\nstrategies. The purpose of site visits is three-fold: to review community policing activities, to ensure\ngrantee compliance, and to provide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will\nbe notified in writing in advance of any on-site review of your COPS Office grants. This review is\ngenerally performed over a period of one or more days and also provides an opportunity for agency\nrepresentatives to seek assistance on any grant implementation issues.",

In the event your agency has any audit recommendations (findings)\nresulting from noncompliance and/or poor accounting practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison\nSection will work with your agency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close\nrecommendations may include repayment of grant funds and/or the submission of documentation. Grantees are responsible for remedying any grant noncompliance that is identified during site visits,\noffice-based grant review, and/or alleged noncompliance reviews. In addition, grantees are responsible\nfor remedying noncompliance stemming from audit recommendations identified in audits of COPS Office\ngrants conducted by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer\n(OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include, but are not limited to: suspending active grant funding,\nrepayment of unallowable or unsupported costs, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination\nof remaining grant funds, or restriction from receiving future grants for a period of time.",

A hold may be placed on your award if it is\ndeemed that your agency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an\nongoing federal civil rights investigation. If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate\nor draw down federal funds under your agency\u2019s COPS Office grant award until you comply with federal civil\nrights laws or cooperate with any ongoing federal civil rights investigation. What you should do: As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the\napplicable federal civil rights laws and to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective\nenforcement of such laws and to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes\nproviding access to records, accounts, documents, information, facilities, and staff. 11. Equal Employment Opportunity Plan\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that funds the COPS Office, that \u201cthe\nfull and equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal\njustice system is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act\u2019s program to reduce crime and delinquency\nin the United States\u201d (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.301). EEOPs do not impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status,\nthe number of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization has fewer than 50 employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the\nEEOP requirement. To claim the exemption, your organization must complete and submit Section A of the\nCertification Form, which is available online at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/pdfs/cert.pdf. If your organization is a government agency or private business and receives an award of $25,000 or more,\nbut less than $500,000, and has 50 or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees\nbut excluding political appointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report (formerly called an EEOP\nShort Form), but it does not need to submit the report to the OCR for review. Instead, your organization\nmust maintain the Utilization Report on file and make it available for review on request. In addition, your\norganization must complete Section B of the Certification Form and return it to the OCR.

Contracts and/or MOUs with other jurisdictions\nCondition:\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, sworn law enforcement officer positions and civilian positions, awarded\nmay only be used for law enforcement activities or services that exclusively benefit your agency/task force and the\npopulation that it serves. The items funded under the CAMP grant cannot be utilized by other agencies/task forces\nunless the items would exclusively benefit the population that your agency/task force serves. Why this condition: The CAMP grant is intended to benefit the communities within the grantee\u2019s primary law enforcement\njurisdiction. Therefore, the grantee must use the CAMP grant funding to benefit its own population\nexclusively, rather than contracting out the COPS Office-funded officer(s) to other jurisdictions. What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the CAMP grant cannot provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies\nunless they will directly benefit the grantee\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, a sheriff\u2019s department cannot use a\nCAMP-funded officer to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but can use\nthe CAMP-funded officer to provide direct law enforcement services to towns within its own county. 13. False statements\nCondition:\nFalse statements or claims made in connection with COPS Office grants may result in fines, imprisonment, or\ndebarment from participating in federal grants or contracts, and/or any other remedy available by law. Why this condition: This condition advises recipients of the consequences of submitting false claims or statements on\napplications, financial and programmatic reports, or other grant documents. What you should do:\nEnsure that all documentation related to your agency\u2019s receipt and use of grant funding (grant applications,\nprogress reports, Federal Financial Reports, etc.) is true and accurate. 14. Duplicative funding\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees to notify the COPS Office if it receives, from any other source, funding for the\nsame item or service also funded under this award. Why this condition: This grant was awarded to your agency to address its law enforcement needs that are not funded with other\nfunds, including federal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds.",

If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required\nto report award information on any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to\nreport information on the names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives\nof the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the\nInternet at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward\ninformation and any executive compensation data required by FFATA.

Criminal intelligence systems\nCondition:\nGrantees using CAMP funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. The grantee acknowledges that it has completed, signed, and submitted\nwith its grant award the relevant Special Condition certifying its compliance with 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R.\nPart 23. An inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system that receives,\nstores, analyzes, and exchanges or disseminates data regarding on-going pre-arrest criminal activities\n(examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking,\ngambling, extortion, smuggling, bribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law\nenforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23 contains operating principles for these inter-jurisdictional criminal\nintelligence systems which protect individual privacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use COPS Anti Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) grant funds simply to operate a single\nagency database (or other unrelated forms of technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with\nother jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not apply to this grant. What you should do:\nAll COPS Office grant recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence\nSystems/28 C.F.R. Part 23 as part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies\nintend to use their award funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency\nintends to use grant funds to operate an inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should indicate\nthis on the Criminal Intelligence Systems 28 C.F.R. Part 23 Compliance form that was included with your\ngrant award package, and certify and submit this form along with your signed grant award document as\nyour agency\u2019s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R.

Why this condition:\nSection 534 of Division B, Title V, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.\nL. 113-235) prohibits the use of federal funds to maintain or establish a computer network that does not\nblock the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. This provision protects the public interest\nin the proper management and use of federal funds. What you should do: The recipient must not use award funds to maintain or establish a computer network unless the network\nblocks pornography. This does not limit the use of funds for criminal investigations, prosecution or\nadjudication activities. What are the specific rules regarding termination of grant funding? The COPS Office has the right to sanction or terminate your agency\u2019s project when there is reason to believe\nthat your agency is\n\u2022 not substantially complying with the grant requirements or other applicable provisions of federal law;\n\u2022 failing to make satisfactory progress toward the goals or strategies outlined in its application;\n\u2022 not adhering to grant requirements or conditions;\n\u2022 proposing substantial plan changes to the extent that, if originally submitted, would have resulted in\nthe application being denied funding;\n\u2022 not submitting financial or programmatic reports in a timely manner;\n\u2022 filing false statements or certifications in connection with an application, periodic report, or other\ngrant-related documents;\n\u2022 providing other good cause for sanctions or termination as determined by the COPS Office. In these instances, the COPS Office may\n\u2022 temporarily withhold payments pending correction of the situation by your agency;\n\u2022 disallow all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance;\n\u2022 wholly or partly suspend or terminate your grant;\n\u2022 require that some or all of the grant funds be remitted to the U.S. Department of Justice;\n\u2022 condition a future grant or elect not to provide future grant funds to your agency until appropriate\nactions are taken to ensure compliance;\n\u2022 withhold or restrict your agency from obtaining future awards;\n\u2022 recommend civil or criminal enforcement by other agencies; 27 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual \u2022 take other remedies that may be legally available.

For assistance with financial management and grant administration, please contact the\nCOPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one method of payment available for accessing federal grant funds\u2014the Grant Payment\nRequest System (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables grantees to use a secure Internet\nconnection to request funds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury. A grantee will be able to review previous requests made since July 2009. For more information on the GPRS, please go to www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view the\nuser guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a GPRS account? If you are a new grantee to the COPS Office, your law enforcement executive or government executive\nshould receive notification about GPRS shortly after the COPS Office receives your original signed award\ndocument. This notification will contain all of the information that your agency needs to set up the GPRS\npayment method. If your law enforcement executive or government executive does not perform drawdown\nrequests for your agency, your grant administrator will need to go online to https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/ gprs/welcome to log in and register to become a Drawdown Specialist. Once you are approved, you will\nreceive an e-mail containing a temporary password and information on how to use GPRS. Please note that\npart of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement executive or government\nexecutive or other financial points of contact to validate information provided by the Drawdown Specialist. If you are already registered for a COPS Office grant username in GPRS and would like to add a newly\nawarded COPS Office grant to the existing COPS Office grant username, contact the COPS Office GPRS\nregistration team via e-mail at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information:\n\u2022 User name (for COPS Office grants)\n\u2022 First/last name\n\u2022 Vendor number\n\u2022 Grant number(s) to be added How do we fill out the payment enrollment forms? If you are a new grantee to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on\nthe COPS Office website at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=100.

If you have any questions, or wish to verify your\nACH enrollment form information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you\nare required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able\nto make drawdowns from your grant account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on\nfile with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Grantees are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via\nthe Internet at www.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see section VI of this\nGrant Owner\u2019s Manual, titled \u201cReports,\u201d on page 37. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that\ncalendar quarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office grants. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment\nto ensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal grant funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the grantee\n\u2022 is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\n\u2022 maintains excess cash on hand;\n\u2022 does not adhere to the terms and conditions of the grant;\n\u2022 fails to submit reliable and/or timely reports. How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements. However, reimbursement\nis only for costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM). As a general guideline,\nmost agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly basis. Also, please note that a date range\ncan only be used once. 32 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual Can we earn interest on our grant funds?

Your agency must adequately safeguard grant funds and make sure that they are used for authorized\npurposes only. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must documents be kept? All financial records, including payroll, time and attendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, and\nsimilar documents associated with your CPD award should be kept for at least three years from the date\nthe COPS Office officially closes the award. Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify\nthem by grant year or by fiscal year, whichever you find more convenient.

The new Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 2 C.F.R. Part 200 \u2014 Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform\nGuidance) was effective on December 26, 2013, was implemented by federal agencies on the required\neffective date of December 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of\nSAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? A nonfederal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the nonfederal entity\u2019s fiscal year in federal\nawards must have a single audit conducted in accordance with \u00a7200.514 \u201cScope of audit,\u201d except when\nit elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. An\nauditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or a vendor. Specifically, \u201cFederal awards expended as a recipient\nor a subrecipient are subject to audit under \u00a7200.501, Subpart F.\u201d\nSAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute,\nin effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA\naudit is to express opinions on the grantee\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major\ngrant programs, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address\nspecific compliance issues with respect to COPS Office grant requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part,\nfederal agencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in \u00a7200.338 \u201cRemedies\nfor noncompliance.\u201d These sanctions under \u00a7200.338 \u201cRemedies for noncompliance\u201d could include the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or\nmore severe enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. \u2022 Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost\nof the activity or action not in compliance. \u2022 Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the federal award. \u2022 Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 CFR part 180 and federal\nawarding agency regulations (or, in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding\nbe initiated by a federal awarding agency). \u2022 Withhold further federal awards for the project or program.\n\u2022 Take other remedies that may be legally available. Your SAA reports should not be sent to the COPS Office. If the U.S. Department of Justice is your cognizant\nfederal agency (see the Glossary of Terms on page 64), they should be sent to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse\nat: 35 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual Federal Audit Clearinghouse\nBureau of Census\n1201 East 10th Street\nJeffersonville, IN 47132\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) serves as the liaison between grantees and\nauditors in the conduct of resolving and closing SAA audits.

      "content": "Questions and comments regarding SAA audits\nmay be directed to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. What is the role of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG)? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The primary objective of OIG audits is to assess compliance with grant conditions. OIG audits are designed to\npromote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of grants by evaluating compliance with\nlaws, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the operations encompassed in the scope of the audit. How are COPS Office grants selected for an OIG audit? The OIG may conduct an audit in response to a referral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The\nOIG also surveys U.S. Department of Justice agencies on an annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit\nareas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the OIG selects grants based on a number of\nfactors, including the geographical distribution of grants awarded, award amount, population served, and\ntype of grant (both active and expired). As such, the fact that your grant has been selected for an OIG audit is\nnot necessarily indicative of a suspected concern or problem area. The COPS Office\u2019s Grant Monitoring Division serves as the liaison between grantees and the OIG\u2019s Audit\nDivision, which conducts the audit. After the OIG notifies the COPS Office of upcoming audits to be\nconducted, the COPS Office\u2019s Grant Monitoring Division will send out a notification letter to grantees\noutlining the scope of each audit and the anticipated audit timeframe. This notification letter also advises\ngrantees of the supporting documentation required and information necessary for the OIG during their\nscheduled field work, and provides a COPS Office point of contact to address questions and concerns. If you\nhave any questions regarding an OIG audit, please contact the COPS Office\u2019s Grant Monitoring Division at\n800-421-6770. Questions and comments regarding the administration of your CAMP grant, not specifically\nrelated to an audit, should be referred to your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. Typical Audit Findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to grants as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems:\n\u2022 unallowable costs. Grantee incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget, were in\nexcess of the approved budget, or were charged to the grant after the expiration date and a grant\nextension was not obtained. \u2022 unsupported costs. Specific grant expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by\nadequate documentation. \u2022 lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Grantee failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. \u2022 supplanting. Grantee could not document efforts to backfill vacant local sworn officer positions, or\ngrantee could not explain reductions in local law enforcement budget or in sworn officer positions\nduring the grant award period. \u2022 lack of adequate community policing. Grantee had difficulty demonstrating community policing\nactivities. 36 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual \u2022 funds to better use.",

After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office\u2019s Grant Monitoring Division will continue\nworking as the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The COPS\nOffice will issue a closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must\nkeep all documentation related to the audit for a period of three years following the audit\u2019s closure. 37 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual VI. Reports As part of the CAMP, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well\nas quarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CAMP\nfunding separately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal grants) to ensure\naccurate financial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have\nfinancial internal controls in place to monitor the use of CAMP funding and ensure that its use is consistent\nwith the grant terms and conditions. Good practices in this area would include written accounting practices,\nan accounting system that tracks all drawdowns and grant expenditures, and the ability to track when each\nCAMP position is filled or vacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit\ncomplete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result in the suspension and possible termination of your\nagency\u2019s COPS Office grant funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the\nend of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the\nfunding period and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official grant end date;\nhowever, you will have a 90-day grace period after the grant award end date during which you can draw\ndown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before the grant end date.

The online SF-425 requires the same reporting\ninformation as the paper version. The use of this online application enables authorized users to view past\nSF-425s, and allows them to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports due? (see last paragraph)\nSF-425s for COPS Office grants must be submitted every quarter and no later than 30 days after the last day\nof each reporting quarter, as detailed below:\nTable 1. Due dates of SF-425s by quarter\nReporting Quarters SF-425 Due Date January 1\u2013March 31 April 30 April 1\u2013June 30 July 30 July 1\u2013September 30 October 30 October 1\u2013December 31 January 30 For your first SF-425 submission, determine when the most recent SF-425 reporting quarter ended and\ncomplete an SF-425 to cover the period from the award start date of your grant to that particular end date. You are required to submit an SF-425 even if you have not spent any money or incurred any costs during a\nreporting period. The due dates for online filing of SF-425s are the same as for the submission of paper copies. 38 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual Example: If your award start date is 02-01-13 and the current date is 04-15-13, then your first SF-425 will be due no\nlater than 04-30-13 and will cover the period 02-01-13 (award start date) through 03-31-13 (end of the most\nrecent reporting quarter). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office so that you can successfully\ncomplete a drawdown of funds through GPRS. Grantees who do not submit SF-425s by the due date will be unable to draw down funds. The payment\nsystem contains a function which checks for SF-425 delinquency and will reject a drawdown attempt if the\nSF-425 is not up to date.

Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving\nmust be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to\nthink innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential\nresponses. A major conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured\nand disciplined way is the SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems 51 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine\nthe scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more\nincidents that are similar in one or more ways and that are of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of\nany of these. The police, with input from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Analyzing the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses,\nestablish correlation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is\nimportant to find out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who? what? when? where? how? why? and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Responding to problems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem. The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem or reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Assessing problem-solving initiatives\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by determining if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort\nbut also gathers data that builds knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for\nprocess, outcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered\nduring analysis should be reviewed.",

Strategies and programs can be assessed for\nprocess, outcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered\nduring analysis should be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be\ndeveloped and tested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those aspects that could have an impact on them\u2014for\nexample, capable guardians for victims, handlers for offenders, and managers for locations. Rather than\naddressing root causes of a problem, the police focus on the factors that are within their reach, such as\nlimiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating risk with\nunwanted behavior. Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between the law enforcement agency and the\nindividuals and organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. \u2022 other government agencies\n\u2022 community members/groups\n\u2022 nonprofits/service providers\n\u2022 private businesses 52 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual \u2022 media\nCommunity policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages\ninteractive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems\nthrough collaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in\nprioritizing public safety problems. Other government agencies\nLaw enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies,\nhealth and human services, child support, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members/groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal\nand informal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource\nfor identifying community concerns. Partnerships with these factions of the community can engage\nthe community in achieving specific goals at town hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings,\ndecentralized offices or storefronts in the community, and team beat assignments. Nonprofits / service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncertain interests and can include such entities as victims\u2019 groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups,\nadvocacy groups, and the faith community. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners\nbecause they often bring considerable resources to bear on problems of mutual concern. Businesses can\nhelp identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security apparatus\nand community outreach. The local chamber of commerce can also assist in disseminating information\nabout police and business partnerships and initiatives.

It encourages the application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing emphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and\ninfuse it throughout the entire department, including the way the department is managed and organized,\nits personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management needs to infuse community policing ideals\nthroughout the agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal\nlabor relations, decentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and\nprocedures, organizational evaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture Changing the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem solving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and communication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership Leaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community policing, and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders,\ntherefore, must constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within\ntheir organization and support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the dominant way of\ndoing business. 54 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor need to be a part of the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community\npolicing philosophy. Including labor groups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are\nimperative to community policing implementation. Decision making Community policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision\nmaking. Decentralized decision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing.",

Decision making Community policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision\nmaking. Decentralized decision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately\nfeels accountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision making involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for\nrisk taking in problem-solving efforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing\nsufficient authority to coordinate various resources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy\nto establish relationships with the community will help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide\ncommitment to community policing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and\nexpertise. If a strategic plan is to have value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and\nable to give examples of their efforts supporting the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and\nvalue statement should be simple and communicated widely. Everything should connect back to this plan. Policies Community policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures\nto ensure that community policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and partnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with\ncorresponding sets of procedures where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrest, response\ntimes, tickets issued, and crime rates), community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome\nmeasures to include such things as community satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems,\nand improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to\nevaluation\u2014one that looks at how feedback information is used, not only how it measures outcomes. Transparency Community policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than\ntraditional policing. If the community is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily\nsharing relevant information on crime and social disorder problems as well as police operations with the\ncommunity. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local\npatrol officers have decision-making authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved\nthrough long-term assignments, the development of officers who are generalists, and using special units\nappropriately. 55 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term\nassignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or areas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance\ncustomer service and facilitate more contact between police and citizens, thus establishing a strong\nrelationship and mutual accountability. Beat boundaries should correspond to neighborhood boundaries\nand other government services should recognize these boundaries when coordinating government publicservice activities.

Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers have to be able to handle multiple\nresponsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the\ncommunity. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just in special units, although\nthere may be a need for some specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly\ncomplex problems or managing complex partnerships. Resources and finances Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources to\nsupport community policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are\nsustainable and effective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of\nan agency, including recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff\u2014\nincluding sworn officers, non-sworn officers, civilians, and volunteers, as well as personnel evaluations,\nsupervision, and training. Recruitment, hiring, and selection Agencies need a systematic means of incorporating community\npolicing elements into their recruitment, selection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize\ncommunity policing and problem-solving responsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers\nwho have a spirit of service, instead of only a spirit of adventure. A community policing agency must also\nthoughtfully examine where it is looking for recruits, whom it is recruiting and hiring, and what is being\ntested. Some community policing agencies also look for involvement of the community in this process\nthrough the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations Tie performance evaluations to community policing principles\nand activities that are incorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional structures\nshould support sound problem-solving activities, proactive policing and community collaboration, and\ncitizen satisfaction with police services. Training Training at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing\nprinciples and tactics. It also needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication\nand analytical skills, and techniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers\ncan be trained to identify and correct conditions that could lead to crime, to raise public awareness, and\nto engage the community in finding solutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to\nlearn how to encourage problem solving and help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until\ncommunity policing is institutionalized in the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to\ntake place regularly. 56 COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Grant Owner's Manual Information systems (technology) Community policing is information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in helping to provide ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with improving two-way communication with citizens and\nwith developing agency accountability systems and performance outcome measures.

Communication/access to data Technology provides agencies with the ability to communicate externally with the public and internally with their own staff. To communicate with the public, community policing\nencourages agencies to develop two-way communication systems through the Internet to provide online\nreports, reverse 911 and e-mail alerts, discussion forums, and feedback on interactive applications (surveys,\nmaps), thereby creating ongoing dialogs and increasing transparency. Technology also encourages effective internal communication through memos, reports, newsletters, e-mail\nand enhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other\nentities for more efficient operations. Community policing advocates the use of technology to develop\naccountability and performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a\nbroad array of measures and information. Community policing also promotes the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely\ninformation on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers\nin their patrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem\nanalysis functions by enabling agencies to gather information on greater aspects of events including more\ndetailed information on offenders, victims, crime locations, and quality-of-life concerns, and to further\nenhance analysis. Quality and accuracy of data Information is only as good as its source, and, therefore, it is not useful if it\nis not of high quality and accurate. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to\nensure that information from various sources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central\nsystems that are linked to one another and checked for accuracy so that the information can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance measurement.
