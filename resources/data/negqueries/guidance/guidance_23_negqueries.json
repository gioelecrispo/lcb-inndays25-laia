The substance of the\nrelationship is more important than the form of the agreement in determining whether the recipient of the passthrough funds is a subrecipient or a contractor. Keep in mind that the awarding and monitoring of contracts must\nfollow documented procurement procedures, including full and open competition, pursuant to the procurement\nstandards in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.317- 200.326, and the issuance of subawards must meet the requirements of 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\n200.331. Any recipient of an award will be responsible for monitoring subawards and contracts in accordance with all\napplicable statutes, regulations, and guidelines. Primary recipients will be responsible for oversight of subrecipient\nor partner spending and monitoring specific performance measures and outcomes attributable to the use of COPS\nOffice funds.

Compensation for\nindividual consultant services procured under a COPS Office award must be reasonable and allocable in accordance\nwith Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cost principles, and consistent with that paid for similar services in\nthe marketplace. The services should be commensurate with the rate or salary paid by the primary employer. 7 2018 COPS Office STOP School Violence: School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nUnless otherwise approved by the COPS Office, independent consultant rates will be approved based on the salary\na consultant receives from his or her primary employer, as applicable, up to $650 per day (or $81.25 per hour). Please note that this does not mean that the rate can or should be as high as $650 for all consultants. If individuals\nreceive fringe benefits from their primary employer, such fringe benefit costs should not be included in the\ncalculation of consultant rates. A consultant rate justification will need to be submitted for review and approval to\nthe COPS Office for any consultants hired through a noncompetitive bidding process and paid more than $650 per\nday prior to incurring any costs.

See also award condition 13, \u201cDuplicative Funding.\u201d 4. Comprehensive School Safety Assessments\nCondition:\nRecipients awarded funding through the SVPP must conduct comprehensive school safety assessments for all\nschools involved in the funded project within the 24-month grant implementation period. The assessments should\nbe completed as soon as possible as they can be used as strategic evaluation tools to identify school safety issues\nand potential resolutions. This condition can be waived for recipients that can demonstrate that comprehensive\nschool safety assessments have already been performed or updated within the previous three years. The COPS\nOffice will monitor SVPP grants to ensure that recipients comply with this condition. 8 2018 COPS Office STOP School Violence: School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition: In order for school safety interventions to be most effective, they should be incorporated into broader school\nsafety planning and assessment efforts and be designed to meet the unique individualized needs of each school\nand challenges of each jurisdiction and each school at which they will be implemented. Comprehensive school\nsafety assessments examine the overall safety, accessibility and emergency preparedness of school buildings and\nground and are essential to school safety decision making. Information about conducting site assessments,\nincluding free assessment software can be found at https://rems.ed.gov/SITEASSESS.aspx. What you should do:\nAgencies should keep record of the date(s) of the assessment(s) as well as specific areas of the school(s) where\nproblems were identified and the proposed (if any) recommendations for resolution. Participants (law\nenforcement, teachers, students, any staff, et cetera) should also be included. Please contact your Grant Program\nSpecialist at 800-421-6770 or at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov. 5.

Extension requests must be received prior to the end date\nof the award. 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.308(d)(2). Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. When justified, the COPS Office will seek to accommodate reasonable\nrequests for no-cost time extensions to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed. Requests to extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before\nthe official award end date. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension before the award end date\nmay result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. Please note that the project period of\nperformance will be extended, if necessary, until the deliverable is considered final. If the award is set to expire,\nprior to the final approval of the deliverable, a no-cost extension will be executed for a reasonable amount of time\nfor the recipient to complete the final deliverable. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nAward modifications under the SVPP are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.308. For federal awards in excess of $250,000, any modification request involving the reallocation of funding between\nbudget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of the total approved budget requires 9 2018 COPS Office STOP School Violence: School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nprior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award amount or budget modification\npercentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In addition, all modification\nrequests involving new budget items or any budget modification that changes the scope of the project requires\nprior written approval by the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Please be aware that the COPS Office will\nnot approve any modification request that results in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you are required to expend federal\nfunds only as approved in the FCM. Requests to change or alter an award that meet certain threshold\nrequirements must be submitted to the COPS Office for written approval, prior to their purchase or\nimplementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it was originally\noutlined and accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within the\noriginal scope of the award.",

Information Sharing with Law Enforcement\nCondition:\nRecipients are required to ensure that schools within their jurisdiction share school threat information and data\nwith the appropriate local law enforcement agencies. Why this condition:\nPreventing and responding to school violence requires meaningful partnerships and information sharing with\nvarious community stakeholders, especially schools and law enforcement. 10 2018 COPS Office STOP School Violence: School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What you should do:\nSchool threat information should be shared with appropriate local law enforcement agencies as soon as possible to\nensure that there is adequate situational awareness to evaluate and respond to threats in a timely manner. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). 2 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 200.327 \u2013\n200.328.

Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard\nForm 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days\nafter the end of the award period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during\nthe funding period, and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date;\nhowever, you will have a 90-day grace period after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for\neligible expenditures incurred before the award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic\nor financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable\nexpenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports\nare discussed in greater detail in the section titled \u201cReporting Requirements\u201d in this manual. All reports should be\nsubmitted within the deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial\nactions; failure to submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that recipients receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be monitored to ensure\ncompliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations.

The purpose of site visits is threefold:\n1.\n2.\n3. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review implementation of evidence-based school safety strategies and programs To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare for the\nreview of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period of one or more days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while on-site or, if necessary,\nfollowing the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or\ntechnical assistance on the implementation of their award. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an EOBGR\nconducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference.

If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate or draw down federal funds under\nyour agency\u2019s COPS Office award until you comply with federal civil rights laws or cooperate with any ongoing\nfederal civil rights investigation. What you should do:\nIncluded with your award package is a memorandum from the Office for Civil Rights, Office of Justice Programs,\nU.S. Department of Justice, which addresses the federal civil rights statutes and regulations applicable to your\naward. You should review this memorandum to understand your agency\u2019s civil rights responsibilities. 14 2018 COPS Office STOP School Violence: School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the applicable\nfederal civil rights and nondiscrimination laws to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective\nenforcement of such laws, and to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes providing\naccess to records, accounts, documents, information, facilities, and staff. 11.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) does not impose quotas or hiring\nrequirements on recipients of federal funds. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private\nbusiness and has received a single award for $25,000 or more and has fifty or more employees (counting both fulland part-time employees but excluding political appointees), then it has to prepare a Utilization Report and submit\nit to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within 120 days from the date of the award. Although the OCR has discretion\nto review all submitted Utilization Reports, it will review the Utilization Reports from recipients that receive an\naward of $500,000 or more.

Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and subaward information, and\nthe award term provides guidance to report the related information as required by FFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and systems\nin place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements should it\nreceive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required to report award information\non any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to report information on the names and\ntotal compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the website at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool\nthat your agency will use to capture and report subaward information and any executive compensation data\nrequired by FFATA. The subaward information entered in FSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov\nassociated with your agency\u2019s award, furthering federal spending transparency.

Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using award funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with the\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. By signing the Certification of Review and Representation of Compliance\nwith Requirements in the application, the recipient assured the COPS Office that it will comply with the\nrequirements of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found in 28 C.F.R. Part 23. An\n\u201cinterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system\u201d is generally defined as a system that receives, stores, analyzes,\nexchanges, or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal information systems that protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use award funds to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms of technology)\nand will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not apply to your\naward. What you should do:\nRecipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence Systems/28 C.F.R.",

However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the recipient\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4. is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\nmaintains excess cash on hand;\ndoes not adhere to the terms and conditions of the award;\nfails to submit reliable or timely reports. How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements; however, your reimbursement\nrequests should cover a specific time frame and include only costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM). As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once. Can we earn interest on our award funds? For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified at 31\nC.F.R.

This guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments awarded on or after\nDecember 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of SAA requirements. 2\nC.F.R. Part 200, Subpart F \u2013 Audit Requirements, available at www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl, establishes the requirements for organizational audits that\napply to COPS Office award recipients. Recipients must arrange for the required organization-wide (not award-byaward) audit in accordance with the requirements of Subpart F. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.514 (Scope of audit) except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit is\nto express opinions on the recipient\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and nonmajor award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address specific\ncompliance issues with respect to COPS Office award requirements.

Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the OIG for award audits? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits are\ndesigned to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on an\nannual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the\nOIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the geographical distribution of\nawards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and expired), and type of award (hiring\nand nonhiring). As such, the fact that a recipient has been selected for an OIG audit is not necessarily indicative of\na suspected concern or problem area. 46 2018 COPS Office STOP School Violence: School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What are the steps in an OIG audit?

Typical audit findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to awards as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems:\n\u2022 Unallowable costs. Recipient incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget or a budget\nmodification, were in excess of the approved budget, or were charged to the award after the expiration date\nand an award extension was not obtained. \u2022 Unsupported costs. Specific award expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by adequate\ndocumentation (including but not limited to receipts or purchase orders), that may have been allowable\nunder the program, but for which no prior written approval was obtained from the COPS Office, or award\nexpenditures were in excess of actual approved award costs. \u2022 Lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Recipient failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. \u2022 Funds to better use. Funds could be used more efficiently based on management actions such as reductions\nin outlays; deobligation of funds; withdrawal; costs not incurred by implementing recommended\nimprovements; and other identified savings. 47 2018 COPS Office STOP School Violence: School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\n\u2022 Questioned costs. Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted from a\nviolation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, award terms and conditions, or other\ndocument governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable and do not\nreflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because costs at the time\nof the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. \u2022 Policy and procedure. Weaknesses are identified in a recipient\u2019s accounting practices, fiscal stewardship,\naccuracy of data used in the development of the award applications, and/or inventory controls that led to the\nrecommendation cited in the audit. The recipient is required to develop or revise policies and/or procedures\nconsistent with their existing practices and submit to the COPS Office to forward to the OIG to close the\nrecommendation.

Reporting Requirements As an SVPP award recipient, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Programmatic Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report SVPP award\nfunding separately from all other funding sources, in order to ensure accurate financial and programmatic\nreporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have adequate financial internal controls in place\nto monitor the use of all funding, and also to ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms and conditions. Good stewardship in this area includes written accounting practices, use of an accounting system that adequately\ntracks all award drawdowns and expenditures, and has the ability to track when award-funded positions are filled\nor approved purchases are made. Failure to submit complete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result\nin the suspension and possible termination of your agency\u2019s COPS Office award funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit a quarterly Federal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the\naward period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period\nand the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to\ndraw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however, you will have a 90-day\ngrace period after the award end date during which you can draw down funds for eligible expenditures incurred\nbefore the award end date. How do we file Federal Financial Reports? All COPS Office award recipients are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Recipients are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office Agency Portal\nwebsite at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov to log in; once you are logged in, select \u201cApplications\u201d from the agency\nportal menu, click on the \u201cSF-425\u201d icon, and follow the instructions to complete and submit your reports. The\nonline SF-425 requires the same reporting information as the paper version. The use of this online application\nenables authorized users to view past reports and allows them to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter.

You are required to submit an SF-425 even if you have not spent any\nmoney or incurred any costs during a reporting period. The due dates for online filing of SF-425 reports are the\nsame as for the submission of paper copies. Example: If your award start date is 09-01-18 and the current date is 11-15-18, then your first SF-425 would be due no later\nthan 10-30-18 and would cover the period 09-01-18 (award start date) through 09-30-18 (end of the initial\nreporting quarter for this award). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office before the submission deadline\nso that you can avoid being delinquent and successfully complete a drawdown of funds through GPRS (submit\nreport as soon as you accept the award and have access to the COPS Agency Portal). Award recipients who do not submit an SF-425 report by the due date each quarter will be unable to draw down\nfunds. The payment system contains a function which checks for SF-425 delinquency and will reject a drawdown\nattempt if the SF-425 is not current.
