The\nDepartment of Justice is committed to ensuring that\nvictims/witnesses are treated fairly as their case moves through\nthe Federal Criminal Justice System. In order to provide victims\nwith notification and information about case events, the\nDepartment of Justice has developed the National Victim\nNotification System (VNS). The VNS program was established as a\nresult of a cooperative effort between the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), the Executive Office for the United States\nAttorneys, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). VNS links the FBI, all Assistant U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices (AUSA),\nand the BOP through the Department of Justice Intranet, and\nallows these three agencies to share victim information. The\nsystem contains the names of all identified victims of Federal\ncrimes. Victim(s) information is entered into the system at the\ntime they are identified following the commission of a crime. The information is used to make notification(s) during the\narrest, arraignment, prosecutorial, and confinement phases. Once an offender is convicted and assigned a U.S. Marshals number\n(register number), case information is electronically forwarded\nto SENTRY to determine if the inmate is in Federal custody. If\nthe inmate information is in SENTRY and there is a match (inmate\nregister number and last name), SENTRY will automatically assign\nthe VWP Case Management Assignment (CMA) to the inmate\u2019s\ninformation. Every 24 hours, SENTRY will update the VNS database, and when\nnecessary, VNS will generate a victim notification request to the\ninmate\u2019s assigned Case Manager. All VWP notifications will be accomplished using VNS, and will\nalso include U.S. Military inmates, state boarders, District of\nColumbia Superior Court cases, and U.S. Parole Commission cases. PS 1490.06\n5/23/2002\nPage 4 At no time are staff permitted to delete victims from VNS. 7. PRETRIAL/HOLDOVER AND/OR DETAINEES.

Procedures required by\nthis Program Statement ordinarily do not apply to these inmates. Victim notification is required in accordance with Section 12 of\nthis Program Statement when an inmate with a VWP assignment in\nSENTRY, in pretrial, holdover or detainer status, releases from\ncustody, escapes, or dies while confined in a BOP institution. 8. INMATE VICTIMS. Inmates who are enrolled in the VWP as a\nresult of being the victim of a Federal crime require the\nearliest possible notice of release related events involving an\nincarcerated offender. However, the notification time frames\nrequired by this Program Statement ordinarily do not apply to\ninmate victims since staff must take into consideration any\nsecurity concerns which jeopardizes the inmate victim\u2019s or the\noffender\u2019s safety while incarcerated. If staff are aware that the victim is an inmate, the inmate\nvictim will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in an attempt to\nminimize the risk involved in completing notifications. It may\nbe determined that notification prior to an event occurring would\nbe a greater security concern for the inmate\u2019s involved. 9. [DEFINITIONS \u00a7551.151 a. For purpose of this rule, \"victim\" is generally defined as\nsomeone who suffers direct or threatened physical, emotional, or\nfinancial harm as the result of the commission of a crime. The\nterm \"victim\" also includes the immediate family of a minor or a\nhomicide victim. b. For purpose of this rule, \"witness\" is defined as someone\nwho has information or evidence concerning a crime, and provides\ninformation regarding this knowledge to a law enforcement agency. Where the witness is a minor, the term \"witness\" includes an\nappropriate family member. The term \"witness\" does not include\ndefense witnesses or those individuals involved in the crime as a\nperpetrator or accomplice. c. For purpose of this rule, \"serious crime\" is defined as a\ncriminal offense that involves personal violence, attempted or\nthreatened personal violence or significant property loss. d. For purpose of this rule, the phrase \u201crelease from a Bureau\ninstitution\u201d refers to an inmate's furlough, parole (including\nappearance before the Parole Commission), transfer to a state or PS 1490.06\n5/23/2002 Page 5\nlocal detention facility, transfer to a community corrections\ncenter, mandatory release, expiration of sentence, escape\n(including apprehension), death, and other such release-related\ninformation.] This also applies to inmates serving a concurrent Federal\nsentence in a state or local facility. Refer to Section 10.a. of\nthis Program Statement for specific notification procedures\nregarding state concurrency cases. Inmates who are transferred\nfrom a BOP institution to a local detention facility on a\ntemporary basis for disciplinary or other reasons, do not require\nnotification. e. Federal inmates housed in state facilities (state boarders)\nor community corrections centers (CCC) are the responsibility of\nthe appropriate Community Corrections Manager (CCM). In these\nsituations, the terms \u201cWarden\u201d, \u201cUnit Manager\u201d and \u201cCommunity\nCorrections Manager\u201d are synonymous. f. \"VWP\" refers to a CMA assignment assigned to an inmate\nwho has victims. Central Office VWP staff approve and enter into\nSENTRY all \u201cVWP*\u201d assignments for an inmate who has a BOP staff\nmember as a victim.",

CENTRAL OFFICE VICTIM/WITNESS STAFF. Central Office VWP\nstaff are located in the Correctional Programs Branch and serve\nas the Bureau\u2019s point of contact for victim/witness issues and\nprocedures. They are also the primary liaison to Department of\nJustice staff, other law enforcement agencies, and the public. PS 1490.06\n5/23/2002\nPage 6\nCentral Office VWP staff will enter the VWP assignment and victim\ninformation on U.S. Military inmates, District of Columbia\nSuperior Court cases, and U.S. Parole Commission cases. a. State Concurrency Cases. Inmates identified as VWP cases\nserving a concurrent Federal sentence in a state facility will be\nassigned a VWP CMA assignment. Central Office VWP staff will\ncomplete notifications in the following manner (see Attachment E,\nG):\n! Forward a copy of the notification to the victim within\n30 calendar days after VNS posts the notification. A\ncopy of the letter must be forwarded to the appropriate\nRegional Inmate Systems Administrator (RISA). ! Forward a copy of the notification to the appropriate\nofficial in the state department of corrections\nconfining the inmate, along with a copy of the\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System\nPamphlet. ! Mail all letters via regular mail. b. Witness Security Inmates. The Inmate Monitoring Section,\nCentral Office, coordinates all notification procedures for\nWitness Security inmates with a VWP CMA assignment. The Case\nManagement Coordinator (CMC) at the facility where the Witness\nSecurity inmate is housed will contact the Inmate Monitoring\nSection, Central Office, to ensure proper notifications are made\nto the victim(s). c. All victim/witness contact changes (i.e., address, phone\nnumbers, fax numbers, etc.) must be sent to the Correctional\nPrograms Branch, Unit Management Section, Central Office, to\nensure the changes are entered into VNS on all linked victims. 11. INSTITUTION VICTIM/WITNESS COORDINATOR (VWC). Each Warden\nwill designate a VWC, ordinarily not below the department head\nlevel, to provide technical expertise, monitor, and train staff\non VWP and VNS. If a notification is inadvertently sent to a Case Manager other\nthan the inmate\u2019s Case Manager, the following steps will occur:\na. Unit staff will update the case manager assignment in\nSENTRY;\nb. Unit staff will notify the VWC of the CSW change; PS 1490.06\n5/23/2002\nPage 7\nc. The VWC will cancel the first notification; and d. The VWC will recreate a notification for the appropriate\nCase Manager. 12. ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM.",

When a\nvictim contacts unit staff and indicates that they have lost\ntheir VIN or PIN, unit staff will regenerate an initial letter\nand forward it to the victim at the address contained in VNS. 13. NOTIFICATION [PROCEDURES \u00a7551.152 a. A victim and/or witness of a serious crime who wants to be\nnotified of a specific inmate's release must make this request to\nthe United States Attorney in the district where the prosecution\noccurred.

Staff shall advise each approved victim and/or witness\nof that person's responsibility for notifying the Bureau of\nPrisons of any address and/or telephone number changes.]\nc. Types of Notifications and Time Frames. All notifications\nwill be made by using the template in VNS. The letters created\nby the template must not be altered in any way that will affect\ntheir content or overall appearance. However, the Victim and Witness Notice form (BP-323) may be\ncompleted as needed for the appropriate notification. The\ninitial notification letter must include a copy of the Department\nof Justice Victim Notification System Pamphlet. Initial and subsequent All notifications will be sent via\nregular mail. with the exception of escape notifications, which\nmust be mailed via certified mail, return receipt requested. The \u201cContact Preferences\u201d option may only be used for initial\ndesignation notifications. The Unit Manager is responsible for ensuring that notifications\nare timely and accurate in the following circumstances: PS 1490.06\n5/23/2002\nPage 8\n(1) Initial Notification. VNS will create a pending initial\nnotification (initial designation) once the inmate\u2019s sentence\ncomputation has been completed. Unit staff will complete the\ninitial notification to the victim(s) within 30 calendar days of\nthe date the notification was posted on VNS. All initial\nnotifications (initial designation) can be made using the\n\u201cContact Preferences\u201d option which allows the preferred\nnotification method of the victim to be used when processing this\ntype of notification. If the victim\u2019s preferred method of notification is a\nletter, the victim will also be provided a copy of the Department\nof Justice Victim Notification System Pamphlet which contains a\nbrief description of VNS procedures and instructions for\naccessing the Victim Notification Call Center. If Central Office staff or the institution VWC enters a\nvictim into VNS, an initial notification (initial BOP) will be\ngenerated in VNS. In this type of notification, staff cannot use\nthe \u201cContact Preferences\u201d option for providing notification. Unit staff will complete an initial notification letter and mail\nit with the Department of Justice Victim Notification System\nPamphlet, to the victim(s) within 30 calendar days of the date\nthe notification was posted on VNS.",

If the \u201cContact Preferences\u201d option is utilized for initial\ndesignation notifications, unit staff will retrieve from VNS and\nreview a Call Tracing Report and a Notification Report by the\nnext work day to ensure each victim received notification. If\nthe victim\u2019s preferred method of contact was unsuccessful, staff\nmust follow-up with an initial notification letter to the victim. The Call Tracing Report and the Notification Report used for\nverification of the completed contact will be maintained in the\nPrivacy Folder, Section I of the Inmate Central File. (2) Parole Hearings. Pending parole notifications will be\ncreated by VNS 60 calendar days in advance of the date of the\nanticipated parole hearing. Unit staff must mail the\nnotification letter(s) to the victim(s) 30 calendar days in\nadvance of the parole hearing. VNS uses the parole hearing date entered in the SENTRY\nParole Hearing Update transaction to create the parole hearing\nnotification. Therefore, it is essential that unit staff update\nthe parole hearing date in SENTRY in order to receive\nnotifications from VNS. For example, if the Case Manager enters\na parole hearing date of \u201c09-2001,\u201d VNS will read this as\n\u201c09-01-2001,\u201d and will forward a notification to the Case Manager\non 07-01-2001.

Notification to the victim(s) will ordinarily\noccur nine months prior to the Presumptive Parole date, which\ncoincides with when the record review Progress Report is mailed\nto the U.S. Parole Commission. Additionally, unit staff must prepare a memorandum to the\nU.S. Parole Commission (Attachment A) indicating a victim (not to\nbe specifically identified) may wish to submit written comments\nor attend the hearing. This memorandum must be included in the\nreview material provided to the Parole Examiners before the\nhearing. (3) Escapes. Unit staff must notify each victim by\ntelephone as soon as possible after the escape is discovered and\nconfirmed (normally the same day), and provide the date and time\nof a VWP inmate\u2019s escape. If there are multiple victims in the\ncase, unit staff may contact the VNS Call Center via fax using\nthe Escape/Immediate Release/Call Cancellation form (Attachment\nH) to initiate the telephonic notification system. If telephonic contact is not possible, unit staff will\ncomplete the notification process by forwarding a BP-323 form to\nthe victim by the next work day via certified mail, return\nreceipt requested VNS. If telephonic contact is made, unit\nstaff will complete the VNS notification process by forwarding a\nBP-323 form to the victim within seven calendar days via\ncertified mail, return receipt requested the notification\npreference.

(6) Transfer to a Community Corrections Center. VNS will\nautomatically forward notification to unit staff once a CCC\nacceptance date has been entered by community corrections staff. Unit staff will complete a BP-323 form. This BP-323 form is\nconsidered final notification and will be forwarded to the\nvictim(s) via regular mail. When written notification to the\nvictim will not likely arrive in advance of the CCC transfer,\ntelephonic contact with each victim will be made. Ordinarily, the notification of CCC placement is the final\nBP-323 notification to the victim/witness; however, if an event\n(escape, death, immediate release) in the CCC occurs, the CCM\nwill send additional notifications to the victim/witness.
