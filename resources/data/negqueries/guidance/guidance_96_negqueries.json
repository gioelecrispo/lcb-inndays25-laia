It is imperative supervisory staff be informed of all activities in Receiving\nand Discharge. 102. SUPERVISORY STAFF The Case Management Coordinator (CMC) supervises all functions. The Supervisory\nCorrectional Systems Specialist (SCSS) helps the CMC monitor R&D operations. The SCSS is\nresponsible for the daily operation of receiving new commitments and court returns, and\nsupervises discharge functions to ensure property, valuables, and dress-out procedures are\nhandled properly. 103. STAFF RESPONSIVENESS Correctional Systems staff must conduct \u201cOpen House\u201d at least twice a week to address R&D\nissues with the inmate population. It may be held in conjunction with the mailroom or records\noffice open house. Correctional Systems staff must also make regular visits to administrative\nand special housing units. Questions submitted via Inmate Request to Staff Member must be\nanswered in a timely and professional manner. It is suggested a copy of the response be placed\nin the R&D file. 104. PROTECTIVE CLOTHING Protective uniform clothing may be worn while processing property to protect the official\nuniform. Each institution should make provisions to issue protective clothing to Correctional\nSystems staff. 105. STAFF EQUIPMENT It is strongly recommended Correctional Systems staff assigned to R&D wear a radio and/or\nbody alarm. It is also suggested a set of handcuffs and cuff key be part of the regular issue. The\nkeys for the R&D area are \u201crestricted\u201d keys as defined in the Program Statement Correctional\nServices Procedures Manual. 5800.18 8/12/2014 8 106. JUSTICE PRISONER AND ALIEN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM The Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) schedules the movement and\ntransfer of inmates. Trips are normally authorized in advance on a Manifest Report issued by\nJPATS. A copy of the Manifest Report should be received by each institution before movement. It includes the names, register numbers, destinations of inmates being moved, and approved\nholdover points. It also serves as another confirmation of the validity of the delivery and pickup\nof inmates. Inmates not listed on the JPATS issued Manifest Report may not be moved without prior\napproval from JPATS or the Prisoner Transportation Coordinator, Kansas City, Missouri. 107. INTAKE PROCESS R&D staff serve a critical role as the initial Bureau contact for new inmates. Offenders are\nfrequently committed while under the influence or withdrawing from the effects of drugs or\nalcohol. It is important staff be attentive and alert at all times to observe and immediately report\nunusual or volatile behavior. 108. INMATE WORKERS Inmate workers must be under direct supervision and must not be in the area while other inmates\nand property are being processed. For specific work duties, see the Correctional Systems\nManual. 109. SENTRY The SENTRY load/admit transaction is executed for each inmate within two hours of the\ninmate\u2019s arrival at the institution. The release transaction for departing inmates is performed\nimmediately upon release. 110. PHYSICAL LAYOUT AND SECURITY To provide a safe and secure area for intake and release processing, the physical layout of the\nR&D area is of utmost importance. Staff should be able to supervise and monitor the entire\nholding area, which must include:\n\u25a0",

Staff should be able to supervise and monitor the entire\nholding area, which must include:\n\u25a0 An adequate number of holding cells to prevent contact between searched and unsearched\ninmates. New commitments and inmates being released are kept separated at all times. Holding cells or areas are searched before and after each use.\n\u25a0 A private area for conducting intake and medical screening. \u25a0 A secure area for storing inmate personal property and court clothing that is not accessible to\ninmates and unauthorized personnel. \u25a0 Enough lavatories and toilet facilities to accommodate the maximum number of inmates that\nmay be processed in the area, including sinks supplied with hot and cold water, hand soap,\nand towels or air blowers. It is recommended a shower stall be available for inmate use. 5800.18 8/12/2014 9 111. CELL SEARCH AND METHODS OF INSPECTION Security inspections are necessary to control the introduction of contraband, prevent escapes, and\nensure the security, safety, and good order of the institution. All areas must be regularly inspected. Inspections must be made before and after each time an\ninmate is placed in a holding cell. Windows are screened to deter introduction of contraband. No areas holding inmates may contain false ceilings or loose furniture. A holding cell is situated\nto facilitate frequent staff observation. If the physical design prevents such visual contact,\nalternatives such as mirrors or camera equipment are used. Camps are exempt from having\nholding cells, provided they have areas designated to separate searched and unsearched inmates,\nand are able to maintain order and security while processing/discharging inmates. Holding cells\nin camps are also exempted from the false ceiling requirement. Staff frequently inspect all areas in R&D accessible to inmates. Inspections are done at varying\ntimes so as not to set a pattern. Inspections are designed to detect contraband, prevent escapes,\nmaintain sanitation standards, and eliminate fire and safety hazards. Staff conducting inspections must pay special attention to plumbing facilities and traps,\nventilators, security bars, grills, doors, walls, windows, toilets, sinks, chairs, and other hard-toreach or hard-to-view areas. Inspections focus on bent, spread, cracked or cut bars, broken welds, and any sign of steel\nfilings. Other evidence of tampering or weakness, such as fresh paint or discolored areas, is\nreported to the immediate supervisor and the Operations Lieutenant. A mallet is recommended for tapping security bars and sashes (the framed part of the window\nwhich holds the sheets of glass in place) to set up vibrations which, by their deviation from\nnormal sound, would indicate tampering or weakness. This procedure is done per local security\nprocedures and the Correctional Services Procedures Manual. A thin instrument such as a\nputty knife or knife blade can be passed along sashes or bars to locate cuts or depressions that\nmight suggest tampering. The instrument can also be used as a probe to uncover cuts filled with\nsoap, putty, or other substances. A mirror is effective for examining areas that are difficult to\ninspect. 112.

VISUAL SEARCH OF INMATES All inmates or detainees, except those charged solely with misdemeanor offenses, committed for\ncivil contempt, or held as material witnesses, are visually searched and screened with a metal\ndetector while in R&D by Correctional Systems staff. Inmates charged solely with misdemeanor offenses, or detainees committed for civil contempt or\nheld as material witnesses, are not visually searched unless there is reasonable suspicion the\ninmate or detainee is concealing a weapon or other contraband, or he/she consents, in writing, to\nbeing visually searched. 5800.18 8/12/2014 10 Several factors are considered when determining whether reasonable suspicion exists for\nconducting a visual search, including, but not limited to:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Nature of the current charge. Crime of violence. Weapons or drug-related offenses. Offenses involving predatory conduct. Observation of unusual or suspicious appearance/behavior. Discovery of weapon or any other contraband during pat search (or at arrest). Criminal history. Institutional history. If reasonable suspicion is not raised during the intake process (or any time thereafter), including\nthrough interviews with unit staff, R&D staff, medical screening staff, source documentation, or\nself-reporting by the inmate, he/she may not be visually searched. Instead, the inmate or\ndetainee should be:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Thoroughly pat searched. Screened with a handheld or walk-through metal detector. Screened on BOSS chair, if available. Issued institutional clothing to wear and his/her personal clothing closely examined for\ncontraband. \u25a0 Housed separate from other inmates. The results of the above searches could raise reasonable suspicion and justify the need for a\nvisual search. If so, the reasons that justified the search are documented and approved by a\nsupervisor. a. If an inmate or detainee consents, in writing, to a visual search, he/she is considered for\nplacement in the general population. If consent is not obtained and there is no reasonable\nsuspicion to visually search the inmate or detainee, he/she is housed in an area separate from\nall other inmates. b. After initial processing and admission into a facility, a visual search upon reentry into the\nfacility is appropriate. In addition, if the inmate comes into contact with the public, including\na court appearance, a meeting with an attorney, or a social visit, a visual search per the\nCorrectional Services Procedures Manual is appropriate. c. Normally, restraints are removed before a visual search is conducted. R&D staff may be\nasked to help custodial officers remove restraints. Special care is taken to remove restraints\nsafely. All restraints are accounted for and immediately removed from the area. They are\nnot to be placed in an area accessible to inmates. d. Staff should be extremely alert during the visual search to detect hard contraband such as:\nhandcuff keys, weapons, drugs, or other paraphernalia. They may be hidden under arms, the\n5800.18 8/12/2014 11 testicles, the breasts, or the tongue, or in the hair, ear, nose, or body cavities. Staff must\nstrive to preserve the dignity of the individual being searched. e. The physical layout of R&D should be conducive to privacy during visual searches.",

The\nnumber of inmates that can be searched at one time depends on the number of strip stalls\navailable and the number of staff on duty. The number removed at one time should not\njeopardize the security of the area. Disruptive or high security inmates are only processed\nwhen adequate staff are available. g. Inmates empty pockets and remove jewelry and clothing, including shoes, underwear,\ndentures, hair pieces, and clips. Property is placed where other inmates do not have access. Personal property is secured for inventory and processing (see Chapter 4). The inmate may\nnot have contact with clothing or other property after the visual search has begun. h. The inmate stands with feet shoulder-width apart facing the officer. The hair is thoroughly\nexamined. Hair may not be clipped, braided, or secured with a rubber band. The inmate is\nrequested to turn his/her head to vigorously shake hair on each side and pull his/her fingers\nthrough the hair. i.

PAT SEARCH An inmate entering the institution from the community, court, or transfer where he/she may have\ncome into contact with the public is pat searched before entering the institution. The pat search is used more often than any other search and must be properly performed. It is an\ninspection of an inmate that does not require removal of clothing, but includes a search of the\ninmate\u2019s clothing and personal effects. Before starting a pat search, the inmate is required to remove any headgear and the contents of\npockets. The headgear and personal effects are closely inspected. The pat search is conducted as\noutlined in the Correctional Services Procedures Manual. Staff do the following:\n\u25a0 Examine hair, ears, nose, and mouth for contraband. Dentures are removed.\n\u25a0 Have the inmate face away from you with arms extended and feet apart, at least 6 or 8 inches. \u25a0 Search the shoulders and down the back and sides to the belt line. Search the belt line,\npockets, and chest area. Use both hands and start at the base of the neck, follow a direct\ncourse across the back of the arms to the hands, then across the front of the arms to the\nshoulders. \u25a0 From the back at the waistline proceed down the back and sides of the legs to the shoe tops. Check the shoe tops, trouser cuffs, and socks, then inside of the legs well up to the groin,\npaying particular attention to seams and waistband. Some institutions may require removal\nand inspection of shoes/footwear, belt, headgear, etc.\nNote: A visual search may be conducted any time an inmate has contact with the public. See the\nProgram Statement Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas. 5800.18 8/12/2014 14 Chapter 2. INTAKE PROCESSING\n201. SPECIAL COMMITMENTS a. Juvenile Offenders. A juvenile offender sentenced under the Federal Juvenile Justice and\nDelinquency Prevention Act is placed in a non-Federal facility. Regular contact with inmates\nsentenced under adult statutes is not permitted. A juvenile is not placed in a Federal facility\nwithout prior approval from the Director of the Bureau of Prisons. For further guidance, see the\nProgram Statement Juvenile Delinquents. b. Civil Contempt of Court Commitment. An inmate committed to serve a civil contempt\nsentence is treated in the same manner as an unsentenced holdover. (See the Program Statement\nCivil Contempt of Court Commitments.)\n202. COMMITMENT DOCUMENTATION Commitment documentation is carefully reviewed to verify the inmate\u2019s commitment to the\ndesignated facility and to alert institution staff to significant facts regarding the inmate. The\nfollowing is a list of documentation normally used to commit prisoners to Bureau facilities:\na. Judgment in a Criminal Case (J&C). This is issued by a Federal court on a sentenced\ninmate.",

This is issued by a Federal court on a sentenced\ninmate. It prescribes the specific sentencing provisions of the court. A certified copy of the J&C\naccompanies the inmate\u2019s initial arrival to the designated institution [old law \u2013 Title 18, U.S.C.\n4084; SRA \u2013 Title 18, U.S.C. 3621(e)]. This document must bear the signature of the judge and\nthe court\u2019s seal. The \u201cReturn\u201d on the reverse side, or second page, must be properly executed by\nstaff. If the certified copy of the Judgment has not been executed, staff at the designated\ninstitution execute it upon the inmate\u2019s arrival. The exact name on the J&C is used as the\ncommitted name when admitting an inmate to the designated facility. It must appear on all\npaperwork and files generated by the BOP. b. U.S. Department of Justice Parole Commission Warrants (PV, MRV, SPTV), Parole\nForm (H-21). The United States Parole Commission (USPC) issues violator warrants for\nreturning a violator to custody. The warrant has the signature of a parole executive, the USPC\nseal, and date of issuance. Execution of the warrant is done on the reverse side at the designated\ninstitution. c. Transfer Order (BP-A0399). This authorizes the transfer of inmates between Bureau\nfacilities. It is signed by the Warden or authorized representative of the transferring institution\nand executed by Correctional Systems staff or the bus lieutenant upon the inmate\u2019s arrival at the\nreceiving institution. d. Writ or Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) Returns. If the writ was for the purpose\nof prosecution, a Judgment may accompany the inmate. For inmates returning from an Interstate\nAgreement on Detainers, a copy of the Notice of Disposition of a Detainer (Form IX) may be\nincluded. (See the Program Statements Correctional Systems Manual and Transfer of\nInmates to State Agents for Production on State Writs.)\n5800.18 8/12/2014 15 e. Court Orders. Court Orders for civil contempt, confinement as a condition of parole or\nprobation, pretrial services commitment, return to confinement from a court appearance, or other\ntemporary absence may be used as commitment documentation. These orders must bear the\nsignature of the judge, the court seal, and the exact name of the inmate. They are executed in the\nsame way as the J&C. Orders received by facsimile machines with an electronic certification\nattached are accepted after verbal verification. f. Prisoner Remand (BP-A0377). Federal law enforcement agencies use this form to commit\nprisoners to Bureau custody (e.g., pretrial, holdover, Bureau of Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement [ICE] detainees). The agent is responsible for completing the form with as much\ninformation as possible before Bureau staff accept the prisoner. A right thumbprint is rolled onto\nthe Prisoner Remand upon commitment. Each detention facility uses the information on this\nform to load the inmate into SENTRY. Areas of the form are designated for the prisoner\u2019s\nphotograph and fingerprint; therefore, in some instances, the form can be used in lieu of the\nRelease Authorization (BP-A0392). g.

This is used to transfer an inmate\u2019s custody from one\nagency or person to another. As a general requirement, only the inmate\u2019s name and register\nnumber need be entered on the receipt. If additional information, such as offense, sentence, race,\nand age, is required to determine initial housing, and a copy of the receipt is the most efficient\nway to transmit such information, that information is included on the receipt. The officer\nrelinquishing custody receives the original receipt. The remaining copies are usually distributed\nwithin the receiving institution to locations requiring immediate notification, such as the Control\nCenter, Commissary, Hospital, R&D, and the Records Office. b. Transfer Receipt (BP-A0821). This is used to transfer inmates between Bureau institutions\nby airlift, bus, or other Bureau movement. When an institution is receiving inmates, the copy of\nthe Transfer Receipt, with the original signature (from the receiving institution) remains with the\ntransporting officers. One copy may be used at the receiving institution to document\ncommitment. If one is not received, a new copy may be prepared, or a Marshals Receipt may be\nused to document receipt of the inmate(s). Property transferring between institutions is recorded\non this receipt. 204. NOTIFICATION OF MOVEMENT The intake process begins when Correctional Systems staff become aware of an inmate\u2019s\npending arrival.

INTAKE FOLDER Staff will access the Electronic Designation System (e-des) to retrieve the designation packet and\nprepare an intake folder for designated inmates. The designation packet contains the Presentence\nInvestigation Report, Individual Custody and Detention Report, J&C, warrants or detainers, and\nthe SENTRY Security Designation form. Packets are filed in Correctional Systems in a pending\nfile until the inmate arrives. An intake folder may also be prepared for other types of\ncommitments (i.e., pretrial, holdover, transfer, court commitment). The forms included in these\npackets are determined by the status of the inmate and the needs of the institution. 206. DESIGNATION INFORMATION Movement staff review the SENTRY Security Designations for commitment dates, projected\nrelease dates, and any special notations. 5800.18 8/12/2014 17 Staff will utilize daily designation logs or rosters to monitor voluntary surrender dates. If\ninmates do not arrive by the surrender date and time, staff will access Sentry or contact the U. S.\nMarshal Service regarding extensions and updates. The staff member documents the results in\nthe intake folder. If an inmate arrives at the facility and a designation packet has not been received, Correctional\nSystems staff will access e-des to retrieve the packet. If no packet is available, staff contact the\nappropriate team at the DSCC to request the packet be forwarded as soon as possible. Special\nhousing arrangements and decisions regarding accepting inmates without proper paperwork, or\naccepting inmates at other times than the prescribed date, are made by the Warden or designee. 207. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS Officers of any Federal or military agency and contract guards employed by Federal agencies\nwho are committing prisoners to BOP facilities are required to display official identification. Credentials, badges, and paperwork authorizing the agents to perform in their capacity are\nclosely inspected before allowing entry into the facility. Non-Federal officers assigned to a Joint\nTask Force must have Federal task force identification or be accompanied by a Federal official. The name of the delivering officer appears on the commitment documentation and must coincide\nwith their personal identification. When possible, the names of escorting officers are obtained in\nadvance of their arrival. Correctional Systems staff must ensure ammunition and weapons are\nsecure before allowing the agent entry into the facility. Staff are courteous, professional, and\ndisplay a neat appearance in their daily contact with law enforcement officials. 208. IDENTIFICATION OF INMATE Positive identification of each inmate is critical and must be done as soon as possible. In\naddition to the verification of an inmate\u2019s identity before entry into the institution, identity is\nverified again when the inmate is removed from the holding area for intake processing. The\nidentification process includes verbal questioning of the inmate as to name, date of birth, and\nregister number.

ESCORTING INMATES INTO THE INSTITUTION Inmates are pat searched before entry into the institution. Inmates are escorted to R&D by\nCorrectional Systems staff if they are on duty. When possible, staff use a route that does not\nallow visual or verbal contact with inmates already at the facility. Entrances and exits to R&D\nare secured during the intake process, and inmate orderlies or workers are not present. 210. INCLUSION IN THE SENTRY DATABASE The SENTRY Load/Admit transaction is executed for each inmate within two hours of arrival. Only in an emergency and when approved by the Warden or designee is an inmate released to\nthe general population before completion of this transaction. 5800.18 8/12/2014 18 Staff stay extremely alert for inmates detected as \u201cMost Wanted by the FBI or U.S. Marshals\nService\u201d during the Load/Admit transaction. If a match is indicated, a profile or load data is\nreviewed for more descriptive information. The offense remarks provide detailed instructions\nfor further action. Staff also pay close attention to inmates with separatees already committed to the institution and\nalert R&D supervisory staff or the Operations Lieutenant. 211. ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTER NUMBER An inmate\u2019s register number is assigned by the USMS when the prisoner first enters into USMS\ncustody and is documented on the USM-129. The register number remains with the inmate\nthroughout commitment and during any supervision. The register number consists of five digits,\na hyphen, and three more digits. Special-purpose numbers are used when there is no opportunity to obtain a number from the\nUSMS. Institutions housing pretrial inmates, safekeepers, or presentence admission cases are\nissued a block of numbers by the USMS office of their district to be used when an inmate is\nremanded without a previously assigned number. A Name Search transaction is done before loading an inmate into SENTRY. Multiple name\nsearches are done when inmates have hyphenated names. If an inmate has an existing number in\nSENTRY, staff admit with this number and update the load data. In no case is an inmate allowed\ntwo register numbers. Staff must be alert to this type of issue and correct it immediately. See\nthe SENTRY General Use Manual for additional instructions. Note: Correctional Systems staff at the institution where the inmate is located ensure each\ninmate\u2019s register number is correct. The Correctional Programs Branch assigns register numbers for inmates received from state\ninstitutions who are enroute to a foreign country. The DSCC assigns numbers to state, territory,\ncommonwealth, and military prisoners designated to serve their sentences in Federal institutions. Institutions with special-purpose numbers assign their own register numbers. 212.

A variety of sizes are\nkept in R&D to ensure proper fit. 214. INTAKE SCREENING The staff member processing new admissions ensures each inmate receives a social interview\nconsistent with the Program Statement Intake Screening and is cleared by the Health Services\nDepartment before placement in general population. To avoid processing delays, intake staff are\nnotified as soon as new admissions arrive. 215. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF INMATE Inmates entering a Federal institution complete the Acknowledgment of Inmate Forms (BPA0407 and BP-A0408), if not already completed. These forms provide information on\ncorrespondence, authorization for disposition of funds, monitoring of telephone calls,\nnotification in case of death or illness, and disposition of property in case of death. A space is\nprovided in each section for the inmate\u2019s signature. Intake screening staff who witness the\ninmate\u2019s completion of the form also sign. If the inmate refuses to sign, witnessing staff will\nindicate in the space provided. The mailroom is notified by copy of the form if the inmate signs Part 1 of the \u201cCorrespondence\u201d\nsection, electing not to have general mail opened and inspected. Inmates who are unable to\nprovide information in the section \u201cNotification in Case of Death/Illness, Disposition of\nProperty\u201d are given a reasonable amount of time to obtain the needed information. 216. INMATE FUNDS R&D staff prepare a Temporary Receipt (Inmate Funds) (BP-197) for funds authorized for\nreceipt at the institution. They include funds received from:\n\u25a0 A voluntary surrender inmate.\n\u25a0 An inmate on escorted trip or furlough return. \u25a0 Inmates escorted by the U.S. Marshals Service. The original receipt is given to the inmate. The R&D officer totals the daily receipts and verifies\nthe funds collected. The funds and the yellow copy of the receipt are placed in a sealed\nenvelope. The R&D officer writes the amount contained in the envelope and signs his/her name\nacross the seal. The funds are placed in a secure depository. The blue copy of the receipt is left\nattached to the receipt book. When the receipt book is completely used, it is returned to\nFinancial Management staff. 5800.18 8/12/2014 20 217. IDENTIFICATION PHOTOGRAPHS AND FINGERPRINTS The Joint Automated Booking System (JABS) is a secure medium used to capture inmate\nphotographs and fingerprints for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI)\nIntegrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) and for other local needs. For\nguidance on the use of JABS equipment, refer to the JABS User Manual. a. Identification Photographs. An identification photograph is taken full face front, eyes open,\nwithout glasses or head coverings.",

An identification photograph is taken full face front, eyes open,\nwithout glasses or head coverings. Optional photographs, including a side view, scars, marks,\nand tattoos, and photographs of inmates wearing prescription glasses, may be taken at the\nWarden\u2019s discretion. The height chart is in the background of the photograph. R&D staff create crew kit cards, bed book cards, and other cards kept at the institution. The\nnumber of photographs taken will vary by institution needs. New photographs are taken if the inmate\u2019s physical appearance changes. Unit Managers review\ninmate photographs during inmate classification and team reviews to determine if appearance has\nchanged enough to warrant new photographs. At any time, a staff member can advise the Unit\nManager or Correctional Systems staff to review the inmate\u2019s photograph to determine if\nappearance has changed enough to warrant new photographs. The R&D Officer ensures new\nphotographs are distributed and extra copies are stored. Inmates are not normally allowed to\nhave identification photographs in their possession. Exceptions are authorized by the Warden.\nb. Fingerprint Cards. Fingerprints are taken at commitment. One full set is taken on the initial\ncommitment of designated inmates, including D.C. Code offenders, violators, and escape returns. This card is filled out in its entirety per the Correctional Systems Manual. The completed\nfingerprint card is placed in the J&C file. One full set of fingerprints is also to be taken on ICE prisoners, holdover, and pretrial inmates. The SENTRY Inmate Label may be used in lieu of typed or printed information on these cards,\nas they are stored with other file material (holdover files, etc.), and not transmitted to the FBI. Fingerprints are submitted electronically to the FBI through the Joint Automated Booking\nSystem (JABS) for designated inmates. The impression of the right thumb is taken when an inmate is received as a transfer from another\nFederal institution, or returns from writ or IAD, and the FBI number is known. The FBI supplies fingerprint and order blanks. Institutions forward requests to the FBI using\nForm I-178, Requisition for Ordering Identification Supplies, available on Sallyport. 218. FINGERPRINTING PROCEDURES For details on capturing fingerprints using JABS, refer to the JABS user manual. This manual is\navailable on the Correctional Programs Branch\u2019s Sallyport page. 5800.18 8/12/2014 21 In the event JABS is not operational, the following procedures will be used for manual\nfingerprinting: The inking surface must be high enough to allow the forearm to be horizontal when the fingers\nare being inked. The person taking the fingerprints moves the inmate into a position where\nhe/she will be comfortable during printing. Cleaning fluid and cloths used to clean fingers\nbefore and after rolling should be available. Staff have the inmate sign the fingerprint card before printing to avoid smearing. Two types of\nimpressions are taken on the FBI fingerprint card: individual rolling and simultaneous printing. The upper 10 fingerprints are taken individually. These are rolled impressions, and are obtained\nby individually rolling each finger from side to side to obtain ridge details.",

These are rolled impressions, and are obtained\nby individually rolling each finger from side to side to obtain ridge details. The smaller\nimpressions, referred to as a \u201ctap,\u201d are at the bottom of the card and are taken by simultaneously\npressing down all of the fingers. The thumb is then printed. In taking the rolled impressions, the side of the bulb of the finger is placed on the inking plate,\nand the finger is rolled. Each finger is inked evenly from the tip to below the first joint. It is\nbetter to ink and print each finger separately, beginning with the right thumb and followed by the\nindex, middle, ring, and little fingers. It is easier to print if the thumbs are rolled toward and the\nfingers rolled away from the center of the inmate\u2019s body. This relieves strain and leaves the\nfingers relaxed so they may be lifted easily without slipping, which might smudge or blur the\nprints. The official taking prints applies light pressure and keeps control of the inmate\u2019s hand during the\nprocess. The degree of pressure exerted in inking and taking rolled impressions is important. The inmate is cautioned to relax and not try to help by exerting pressure. It often helps inmates\nto relax by instructing them to look at some distant object, not at their hands. A brief description of scars, marks, or tattoos and location on the body is noted in the appropriate\nspace on the fingerprint card after the visual search. These markings are also recorded for\ninmates received in transfer. A new fingerprint card is completed if a tattoo is removed. 219. UNUSUAL FINGERPRINT SITUATIONS Staff may encounter situations due to permanent or temporary physical characteristics that call\nfor different fingerprinting techniques \u2013 crippled fingers (bent, broken), deformities (webbed or\nextra fingers), lack of fingers at birth, amputations, and advanced age. If the inmate has crippled or deformed fingers, the fingerprints are still taken. If the fingers are\nso badly bent or crippled that they are touching the palms and cannot be moved, fingerprints are\nnot taken and the card is so noted. Special inking devices similar to those used to fingerprint\ndeceased inmates may be necessary to obtain clear, legible fingerprints from bent or crippled\nfingers. Notations are also entered on the fingerprint card in instances such as: \u201cmissing at birth,\u201d\n\u201camputated,\u201d or \u201ctip amputated.\u201d\n5800.18 8/12/2014 22 Temporary disabilities such as wounds, blisters, and broken fingers or hands are printed as soon\nas possible after healing. 220. INMATE IDENTIFICATION CARD An Inmate Identification Card is prepared for each newly designated inmate. When the inmate is\nreceived in transfer and the previous identification card is usable, R&D staff return the card to\nthe inmate during the intake process. A new Inmate Identification Card is not prepared on a\ntransfer case until a thorough check of the J&C file is made to locate the previous card. If the\ninstitution does not use this card, it remains in the J&C file for future transfers.",

GENERAL INFORMATION There are two types of releases from Federal institutions: temporary and permanent release. Examples of temporary release are furlough, local escorted trip, temporary medical transfer, writ,\nIAD, and court appearance. Examples of permanent release include transfer to another\ninstitution and expiration of sentence. 302. REVIEW OF RELEASE PAPERWORK R&D staff review release paperwork to ensure all necessary forms are present. Any forms\nrequiring the inmate\u2019s signature are executed and the appropriate distribution made. Verification\nof the SENTRY-generated Central Inmate Monitoring (CIM) Clearance and Separatee Data form\nis checked within 24 hours before releasing an inmate. 303. FINAL RELEASE NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES Institution departments may request an inmate report before release to resolve outstanding issues. This procedure, commonly referred to as a \u201cmerry-go-round,\u201d is ordinarily done one workday\nbefore release. Inmates may bring their personal property to R&D for pack-out at this time. R&D staff ensure the inmates identified for release are properly processed. Coordination is\ncritical between R&D and Record Office staff. 304. DAY OF FINAL RELEASE On the day of release, staff have the inmate report to R&D, allowing ample time to complete the\nrequired release steps: search (only if releasing to custody of law enforcement agents), form\ncompletion, dress out, medication, funds, receipt of property, to include any identification\navailable, and final clearance. All processing must be completed before the inmate\u2019s scheduled\ndeparture time. 305. IDENTIFICATION Inmates are positively identified before release by photo comparison and verbal questioning of\nthe inmate as to name, date of birth, and register number. Questions pertaining to the sentencing\ndata, family background, and information in the inmate\u2019s Pre-Sentence Report should also be\nasked. At the time of release, a right thumb print is taken and placed on the Release\nAuthorization (BP-A0392). 306. SEARCH AND DRESS OUT Inmates undergo a visual search by R&D staff unless releasing from a minimum security facility,\nreleasing to the community, or meeting the misdemeanor, civil contempt, or material witness\nexception. These exceptions may only be visually searched per Section 112 of this Program\n5800.18 8/12/2014 24 Statement. Clothing worn to R&D is taken and the inmate dressed in appropriate clothing for the\ntype of release and the climate of the destination. Inmates being released on escorted and medical trips are dressed in institution clothing and shoes\n(excluding camps). Local procedures are developed to handle furlough releases. Inmates are\nauthorized to have release clothing mailed to the institution as provided in Institution\nSupplements. The inmate is placed in a secure area separated from unsearched inmates while\nawaiting departure. 307. MEDICATION Health Services personnel determine if an inmate requires medication upon release. R&D staff\nensure the inmate receives medication before leaving the institution.",

MEDICATION Health Services personnel determine if an inmate requires medication upon release. R&D staff\nensure the inmate receives medication before leaving the institution. 308. FUNDS The inmate is given a gratuity and personal funds per the Program Statement Release\nGratuities, Transportation, and Clothing. Funds are generally distributed by the cashier\u2019s\noffice or through the Control Center, if after normal working hours. Local procedures are\nestablished for dispensing funds to the releasee. 309. SECOND IDENTIFICATION A second identification verification is conducted by a person the Warden designates. The person\nmaking the second identification signs the Release Authorization (BP-A0392) in the space\nprovided. 310. SENTRY RELEASE TRANSACTION A SENTRY release transaction is executed when the inmate leaves the institution. Care is taken\nwhen keying this transaction to ensure the proper release code is used and the release destination\nis correct. To provide this information, release paperwork indicates the release method as it should be\nkeyed in SENTRY. See the SENTRY General Use Manual for specific instructions on the\nrelease transaction. Before releasing an inmate, a SENTRY Name Search Transaction is performed. This search is a\nsoundex of the last and first names and is limited to the facility making the inquiry. If the search\nreveals inmates with identical or similar names, additional verification is done by Correctional\nSystems staff. After the proper inmate has been identified, special care is taken to ensure the\nappropriate commitment file is used and proper release identification requirements, outlined in\nthe Correctional Systems Manual, are followed. 5800.18 8/12/2014 25 311. RELEASE FOR COURT APPEARANCE (WRIT, IAD, ETC.) Inmates released for court appearances are permitted to retain essential legal material,\nappropriate clothing for court purposes, and personal hygiene items. The institution provides\nclothing that allows a neat and clean appearance in court. Inmates ordinarily are permitted to\ntake prescription eyeglasses, dentures, prescribed medical devices, or medication. Property\nremoved from the institution with the inmate must fit in a 14 x 14 x 19 inch box. Other personal\nproperty is stored as discussed in Section 404 of this Manual. 312. TEMPORARY TRANSFER TO A LOCAL MEDICAL FACILITY Inmates transferring to a local medical facility normally are permitted to take prescription\neyeglasses, dentures, prescribed medical devices, or medication. Other personal property and\nfunds are not allowed. 313. RELEASE TO U.S. MARSHAL OR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENT Bureau staff provide information regarding the inmate\u2019s criminal and medical history as well as\ninstitutional behavior to transporting officials on the In-Transit Data Form. This information is\ncritical in maintaining custody and control of the inmate en route to the new destination. It also\nprovides for the welfare of the inmate and enhances cooperation with the transporting agency. For further guidance, see the Program Statement Transfer of Inmates to State Agents for\nProduction on State Writs. Law enforcement officials may arrive at an institution to pick up an inmate with other prisoners\nalready in their custody for delivery to other destinations.",

Staff provide an area for the\ninmates\u2019 comfort and allow for their supervision, as necessary. The inmates allowed temporarily\ninto the facility undergo the same search as regular commitments before entry and remain\nseparate from all other inmates.

Selective Service cards, Social Security cards, drivers\u2019 licenses, and other forms of identification\nare forwarded to the Central File within 24 hours of receipt on inmates designated for service of\nsentence. 402. PROPERTY SEARCH Inmates must be present during search and inventory of their property, except when their\npresence would jeopardize the safety and security of the institution, or if the inmate is absent\nfrom the institution. The following procedures apply when searching inmate property:\n\u25a0 The R&D area must be arranged so a desk, table, or counter separates the inmate from the\nproperty to be searched.\n\u25a0 The inmate does not have access to the property until it has been thoroughly searched,\ninventoried, and recorded on the Inmate Personal Property Record.\n\u25a0 The inmate does not assist in the inventory, packing, or unpacking of property. \u25a0 Searched items are kept separate from unsearched items. \u25a0 Staff separate items according to disposition (i.e., kept, stored, mailed). Inmates choose\nwhether unauthorized items are to be mailed home or voluntarily abandoned. \u25a0 Staff are responsible for detecting \u201chard\u201d or \u201cnuisance\u201d contraband.",

Hard contraband is any\nitem that poses a serious threat to the security of an institution and is not approved for\npossession by an inmate or for admission into the institution. Nuisance contraband is any\nitem not issued to an inmate through normal channels or in excess of allowable limits in the\nProgram Statement and Institution Supplement Inmate Personal Property.\n\u25a0 All clothing is thoroughly searched, with special attention to pockets, seams, hat bills, hat\nbands, collars, waistbands, linings, cuffs, belts, and places where there is more than one layer\nof material. \u25a0 Shampoo, conditioners, lotions, and similar items are searched with a probe, metal detector,\nor scanning device. 5800.18 8/12/2014 30 \u25a0 Special care is used when inspecting religious items \u2013 medicine bags, bibles, religious\nheadgear, etc. The Chaplain is consulted to determine if articles are of religious significance\nand require special handling (e.g., a Tefillin, which in some cases cannot be x-rayed). If a\nChaplain is not available, the item is secured until it can be reviewed by the Chaplain. \u25a0 Special attention is given to shoes (soles, heels, and cavities), radios, books (binding and\ncovers) and photograph albums, as they are difficult to search and are excellent hiding places\nfor drugs and other contraband. \u25a0 Suspicious items that cannot be thoroughly searched are x-rayed or scanned if possible. Items that cannot be searched without destruction or alteration are not permitted in the\ninstitution unless they were purchased at the previous Federal institution. \u25a0 Staff ensure that shipping containers/boxes, wrapping materials, etc., are treated as \u201chot\ntrash\u201d and not accessible to inmates. \u201cHot trash\u201d must be stored in a secure area until\nproperly disposed of. 403. INCOMING PROPERTY A log book is kept in the R&D area to document incoming personal property. It includes the\ninmate\u2019s name, register number, date property is received and issued, and initials of the staff\nmember processing the property. This data may be maintained electronically with proper\nbackup, per the Program Statement Personal Computers and Network Standards. To ensure property was shipped from another institution, property boxes must contain a copy of\nthe Inmate Personal Property Record. When the property is issued and verification of contents is\nmade, the inmate signs the bottom of the record to acknowledge receipt. If he/she refuses to\nsign, the inventory officer and an additional staff member witness, sign, and date the form,\nindicating the inmate\u2019s refusal. If the inmate refuses to accept the property, see Section 405,\nAbandoned Property. Note: A new Inmate Personal Property Record need not be prepared if the inventory is\nunchanged. A new record is prepared if the original record is not legible to note items not listed\non the original record, or to mail items. If property is received for an inmate placed in the Special Housing Unit (SHU), local procedures\nare established for issuance of property.",

Property for voluntary surrenders is processed upon commitment. The Correctional Services\nShift Supervisor ensures the property is processed per this section after duty hours for\nCorrectional Systems staff. Unauthorized items are prepared for mailing by R&D staff. The\ninstitution pays for the shipping costs of clothing the inmate wears upon initial commitment. All\nother property is rejected and shipped at the inmate\u2019s expense to his/her home or other address\nhe/she provides. The USMS is responsible for the disposition of personal property for inmates in their custody. The USMS mails excess property to the inmate\u2019s home or address he/she supplies.

Property for new commitments delivered by USMS is limited to:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Clothing (worn on person). Plain wedding band (no stones or intricate markings). Prescribed medical devices/medication/eyeglasses. Legal material. Earrings for female (one pair, no stones). Identification cards. Currency/negotiable instruments. Religious medal or medallion (no stones) or essential daily prayer items. Voluntarily abandoned items are destroyed per the Program Statement Property Management\nManual. These items must not come into contact with inmates. Items donated by inmates are\ntreated as voluntarily abandoned property. Inmates are allowed to retain legal material if it relates to current litigation or is research material\nnot available at the institution. Consult the institution\u2019s assigned legal representative to decide\nwhether legal material is about an inmate\u2019s current case or regarding limiting legal materials for\nhousekeeping reasons. An Authorization to Receive Package or Property (BP-A0331) is used to authorize incoming\npackages containing release clothing or approved items as outlined in the Program Statement\nInmate Personal Property. The completed form is used in lieu of the Inmate Personal Property\nRecord. 404. STORED PROPERTY R&D must have secure storage for property belonging to inmates released on writ or IAD,\nincoming inmates, and for discarded or abandoned property.

A file\ncontaining the original copy of the Inmate Personal Property Record for items in storage is kept\nin a fireproof cabinet. An inmate may be allowed to store property under the following circumstances, as specified by\nlocal policy:\n\u25a0 The MCC or detention facility has locked deposit boxes available for storage.\n\u25a0 The inmate is admitted for a short duration, such as a study and observation, civil contempt,\nor short sentence, and there is sufficient storage space. \u25a0 Property for a holdover inmate enroute to a non-Federal contract facility is placed in storage\nwhile the inmate is housed at the institution. The property accompanies the inmate upon\ndeparture. If this is not possible, it is shipped to the contract facility within 72 hours after the\ninmate\u2019s departure.\n\u25a0 The inmate is a pretrial inmate and has numerous court appearances.\n\u25a0 The inmate is unable to provide a consignee or address to whom the property can be mailed. This is considered \u201cabandoned property\u201d after 90 days, and is processed as described in\nSection 405. 405. ABANDONED PROPERTY There are two types of abandoned property: \u201cvoluntarily abandoned\u201d and \u201cabandoned.\u201d Voluntarily abandoned property is personal property meeting the criteria in Federal Property\nManagement Regulations 101-48.001-8. Additionally, Justice Property Management\nRegulations 128-48.150 state personal property, regardless of value, left behind by an inmate\nwho has departed an institution, except approved for furlough, is considered voluntarily\nabandoned. Voluntary abandoned property also includes excess property of inmates transferring\nto other institutions and property that new commitments/voluntary surrenders elect not to mail\nhome. At the close of investigations or storage for 90 days, voluntarily abandoned and abandoned\nproperty is stored for 30 additional calendar days. If the property is not claimed, it is handled per\nthe Property Management Manual. If the CEO determines the property is to be destroyed, the\nAbandoned Inmate Property form (BP-A0515) is used. Abandoned property is also property shipped and returned to the institution as undeliverable or\nunclaimed. After the first attempt at shipping, staff locate the inmate who sent the property to\nobtain a new forwarding address. If the inmate cannot be located, or a new forwarding address\ncannot be obtained, the property is considered \u201cabandoned\u201d and is processed for disposal.",

(Refer to Confiscation and Disposition of\nContraband, BP-A0402.)\n\u25a0 Outgoing property is stored in a secure area until it is mailed within 72 hours after the\ninmate\u2019s departure. \u25a0 Property forwarded to another institution is sent to the inmate\u2019s final destination via an\napproved carrier or given to Bureau bus personnel and recorded on the Transfer Receipt. \u25a0 Certain items may be transferred between institutions, with the inmate bearing the cost of\nmailing using postage stamps. A Request-Authorization to Mail Inmate Package is used to\ndocument the mailing. In the case of an indigent inmate, contact unit staff to see if stamps\nare available for payment of postage. When an inmate was not present during processing of\noutgoing property, R&D staff forward to the receiving institution two boxes of property\nauthorized for transfer between institutions. Priority for packing these boxes will be given to\nthe inmate\u2019s personally owned items, as defined by the Programs Statement Inmate\nPersonal Property. R&D staff contact the receiving institution to arrange for postage by the\ninmate for property exceeding the two-box limit. Follow-up with the inmates must be\ndocumented in the R&D file at 45-day intervals. After 90 days, this property will be\nidentified as voluntarily abandoned property, and disposed of in accordance with Section\n405. \u25a0 Unfinished hobbycraft items are processed in the same manner as above by staff from the\ndepartment responsible for the hobbycraft program. No completed hobbycraft items should\nbe mailed to new institution. 407. RELIGIOUS ITEMS When an inmate is received at an institution other than through Bureau transport, religious items\nmust have the Chaplain\u2019s approval before issuance.

R&D provides the envelope to the transporting authorities. (See the Program\nStatements Prisoner Transportation Manual and Religious Beliefs and Practices.) In-transit inmates, with approved essential daily prayer items, are issued those items before\nrelease from R&D. The inmate is responsible for returning essential daily prayer items, along\nwith the manifest envelope, to R&D staff upon departure. R&D staff provide a disposable head covering to any inmate making a request during transport\nby Bus/Airlift or USMS.

DEFINITION AND RESPONSIBILITIES In addition to procedures in this chapter, R&D staff at detention facilities must be thoroughly\nfamiliar with all program statements related to Correctional Systems. Due to the high level of inmate movement at detention facilities, R&D procedures differ from\nthose at other institutions. Various types of processing (assignments, bond releases, hearings,\netc.) occur seven days a week and on holidays. Staff schedules and procedures are developed to\nmeet the needs of the institution and the local district courts it services. Most commitments to detention facilities are unsentenced prisoners who are housed for other\nFederal law enforcement agencies. These commitments, with appropriate documentation, are to\nbe available to those agencies upon demand. Detention facilities receive many inmates directly from the community, often with little or no\nbackground information. Extreme caution must be shown; all inmates must be processed as if\nthey are maximum custody inmates, with the exception of inmates listed in Section 112 of this\nmanual. 502. COMMITMENT VERIFICATION \u25a0 Parole and Mandatory Release Violators. Documentation for violators must conform to\nrequirements in Chapter 2. Inmates designated to the facility for a violator hearing are\nloaded into SENTRY with the ARS assignment of \u201cA-USPC HRG.\u201d Unit staff must be\nalerted to schedule the inmate for a revocation hearing. Correctional Systems staff request\nthe Central File from the last Federal facility of confinement. \u25a0 Sentenced Inmates Received from Other Bureau Institutions. Inmates are received at\ndetention facilities from other Federal institutions for a variety of reasons (Federal writ, U.S.\nAttorney special request, etc.). Ordinarily, the entire central file is not received on these\ncases. Accompanying paperwork must be closely reviewed to identify medical or special\nsecurity needs.",

Ordinarily, the entire central file is not received on these\ncases. Accompanying paperwork must be closely reviewed to identify medical or special\nsecurity needs. These factors are essential in determining housing, escort, and other security\nconcerns. \u25a0 Transfers and Holdovers. The J&C order for short-term offenders must be reviewed before\nan inmate is removed or transferred to another facility to ensure that the release date does not\npass before arrival at the designated institution. Ordinarily, inmates within 30 days of their\nrelease date are not moved. Coordination of these cases with the Case Management\nCoordinator or unit staff is essential. \u25a0 Residential Reentry Center Failures. A transfer order is usually provided by the\nResidential Reentry Manager to authorize pickup of Residential Reentry Center failures. 503. ADMISSIONS AND CONTRABAND Inmates must be positively identified and the proper receipts prepared and distributed. Federal agents complete the Prisoner Remand (BP-A0377) on all new arrivals. 5800.18 8/12/2014 37 Special attention is given to ensure that weapons and ammunition are secured before entry into\nthe facility. Staff must be alert when conducting searches of inmates to detect contraband. 504. INVENTORY, RECEIPT, AND DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY AND\nVALUABLES \u25a0 Disposition of Personal Property. Special arrangements are made to issue property to\ninmates released after arraignment, posting bond, or release while in non-Bureau custody. \u25a0 Receipt for Monies. Funds received for new commitments are receipted by R&D staff using\nthe Temporary Receipt (Inmate Funds) (BP-197) and placed in a secure depository. \u25a0 Inmate Identification Cards. Ordinarily, Inmate Identification Cards are not prepared for\ninmates at detention facilities. \u25a0 Clothing Bags. If clothing bags are used to store civilian clothing, the numbers of the bags\nare recorded on the Inmate Personal Property Record (BP-A0383). Inmates must not have\naccess to civilian clothing. \u25a0 Clothing Exchange. Procedures are developed to allow for exchange/laundering of court\nclothing. \u25a0 Shipping/Mailing Property. Per the procedures in this manual, inmate personal property\nordinarily is mailed/shipped to the designated institution within 72 hours after the inmate\u2019s\ndeparture. 505. LOCKBOX STORAGE Lockbox storage may be used in detention facilities at the Warden\u2019s discretion to provide a safe\nplace to store valuables and money of inmates housed for a short period. Inmates are encouraged\nto send personal property items home and have their monies posted to their Trust Fund account. If lockboxes are used, local procedures must be developed. 506. RELEASE FOR DAILY COURT APPEARANCES Staff ensure that inmates are available when the receiving law enforcement agents arrive to\ntransport them to court. Court movements are given top priority. Local procedures must be\ndeveloped to ensure court procedures, wakeup, feeding, shakedown, and dress out procedures are\ndone in an expeditious and secure manner. R&D staff must be aware of the importance of maintaining communication with law\nenforcement officials and other departments of the institution (control center, lieutenant, unit\nofficer, hospital, etc.) to coordinate court movement.",

The SENTRY out count or release\ntransaction is performed within one hour of the inmate\u2019s departure. When inmates return from 5800.18 8/12/2014 38 court, a hard copy of the out count may be used as a receipt. Staff line out the names of the\ninmates on the hard copy who are not in the return group, and a new receipt is prepared. Local procedures are developed with receiving law enforcement officials addressing items that\ninmates may take with them to court (legal material, medication, etc.). The Bureau does not\naccept responsibility for the loss of property when removed from the facility. Any property\nauthorized to be taken out must be thoroughly searched when going out and upon return to avoid\nintroduction of contraband. When the inmate returns from court, only the exact property taken\nout is allowed to be returned. Medication is forwarded to medical staff for disposition. Special care is made to ensure that the inmate is properly identified against a photo and\ncredentials of the transporting officials are closely reviewed. Inmate orderlies may not be in the R&D area during court movements. In addition to visual and\npat searches, a handheld or walk-through metal detector is used on inmates going to and\nreturning from court. Special care is taken when inmates are dressed in civilian clothing to\nensure they are not mistaken for staff or authorized personnel. Civilian clothing is immediately\nremoved and stored promptly upon return from court. Local procedures are developed to ensure meals are fed to inmates in R&D during meal times. Food carts are inspected for contraband when entering and departing R&D.\n507. COURT LINE Local procedures are developed to ensure new arrests from other Federal agencies are placed on\nthe court line (inmates who have not already been arraigned). Court dockets must not be\ndelayed; expeditious processing is critical. Staff receive the list of inmates for court from the\nUSMS the previous night. The USMS indicates the need for the inmate to dress in civilian\nclothing. R&D staff check for separation and security needs of each inmate going to court. Using the court list, clothing is prepared before the inmate\u2019s arrival in R&D. The inmates are\nbrought to R&D as early as practical, identified with a photo card, and placed in a holding\ncell/area. Inmates who have separatees departing on the same court line are physically separated\nand placed in a separate holding cell. Transporting officials are alerted whenever this occurs. Only legal documents that are relevant to the court case, medication needed for that day,\nauthorized medical devices, dentures, and eyeglasses or other authorized items are allowed to be\ntaken with the inmate. Staff identify transporting officials before surrendering custody of the inmates.",

Only legal documents that are relevant to the court case, medication needed for that day,\nauthorized medical devices, dentures, and eyeglasses or other authorized items are allowed to be\ntaken with the inmate. Staff identify transporting officials before surrendering custody of the inmates. R&D staff\nidentify each inmate with a photo as the receiving Deputy U.S. Marshal applies restraints. Staff\nverify the count as the deputy signs the required receipts. A SENTRY version or handwritten\nreceipt suffices. R&D staff ensure inmates are properly placed on the outcount, and notify the\nControl Center of the number of inmates departing the facility. As the court line returns, R&D staff identify the transporting official. The returning inmates are\nthoroughly pat-searched before entering the secure area of the facility. They are cross-identified\n5800.18 8/12/2014 39 from the list the USMS provides as court returns and the photograph on file. Staff ensure\naccountability of each inmate on the list. Once inmates are identified, the deputies are then\nallowed to depart the institution as the inmates are processed. Inmates are taken from the holding cell, visually inspected, searched with a handheld or walkthrough metal detector, and dressed in institution clothes. After inmates are returned to the\ninstitution from court, but before escort to their housing units, the out count is deleted on\nSENTRY. Court clothes are thoroughly searched and placed back in the appropriate bag. If\ninstitution clothes are worn to court, they are thoroughly searched and sent to the laundry. Inmates may retain medication, such as nitroglycerin and other critical medication for life\nsupport, in the holding cells. R&D staff performing intake screening for court returns inquire of\nthe returning officials if anything significant happened while they were in court that would affect\npossible separation or security concerns. When other staff conduct the interviews, this\ninformation is communicated verbally communicated by CS staff. 508. RELEASE PAPERWORK Paperwork required for some releases is listed below. (See Chapter 2 for additional releases.)\na. Holdovers, Pretrial Inmates \u2013 Bus/Van/Airlifts\n\u25a0 In-Transit Information form (completed by Unit Team)\n\u25a0 CIM Clearance (if CIM case). \u25a0 Judgment and Commitment Order; Parole Violator Warrant; Warrant of Removal, etc.\n(whichever is applicable in each case). \u25a0 BEMR Exit Summary or Medical Summary of Federal Prisoner/Alien In Transit (BPA0659). \u25a0 Envelope containing religious items and the Inmate Personal Religious Property Inventory\n(BP-633)(when applicable). \u25a0 Disposable head covering (when applicable).

If\nR&D staff accompany custodial personnel to the airlift site, they assume responsibility for\nreceipts and files. b. Bond. The USMS may forward a certified copy of the bond order, which is verified for\nauthenticity with the USMS or Clerk of the Court. Special care is taken to ensure that other\ncharges are not pending and that the correct inmate is processed. A name search is made in\nSENTRY, since inmates often have similar names. The court docket or other documentation is\nalso reviewed. In some instances, inmates may be released directly from Court.",

The Bureau does not have authority to\nrelease another agency\u2019s prisoner without their concurrence. It is recommended that an effort be\nmade to have the USMS assume custody of the inmate and effect the release on bond. In this\ncase, they would assume custody from the BOP on the basis of a Prisoner Remand. 509.
