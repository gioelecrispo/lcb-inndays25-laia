Furthermore, all award recipients must retain any CHP-funded\nofficer positions for at least 12 months after the 36 months of federal funding has ended for each position. Recipients are required to use CHP award funds for the specific hiring categories awarded. Funding under this\nprogram may be used to do the following:\n\u2022 Hire new officers, which includes filling existing officer vacancies that are no longer funded in your agency\u2019s\nbudget. These positions must be in addition to your current budgeted (funded) level of sworn officer\npositions, and the officers must be hired on or after the official award start date as it appears on your\nagency\u2019s award document. \u2022 Rehire officers laid off by any jurisdiction as a result of state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) budget\nreductions.

Please do not hesitate to call the COPS Office Response Center at\n800-421-6770 if you need assistance with the implementation of your award. Please note that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is retiring the current Summary Reporting System (SRS)\nand will transition to an all-National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data collection system within the\nnext five years. The transition to NIBRS will provide a more complete and accurate picture of crime at the national,\nstate, and local level. Beginning in 2021, the FBI will no longer collect summary data and will only accept data in\nthe NIBRS format, and COPS Office awards will be based on submitted NIBRS data. Transitioning all law\nenforcement agencies to NIBRS is the first step in gathering more comprehensive crime data. The COPS Office\nencourages its award recipients to submit NIBRS data to the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division in a\ntimely manner, thereby ensuring sufficient and complete crime and arrest data is available for consideration. For\nmore information regarding NIBRS reporting, please see https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/nibrs-overview.

The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed for any\nallowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your CHP award is three years (36 months) of\nfunding for each position awarded. Your award number is in the following format: 2017-ULWX-0000 or 2017-UMWX-0000 for awards funded in Fiscal\nYear (FY) 2017. The COPS Office tracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to\nhave your agency\u2019s award number (or your agency\u2019s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the\nCOPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI, the COPS Office will assign\na non-official ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two characters will be \u201cZZ\u201d). If you\nhave any questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your agency\u2019s ORI number when\nyou contact the COPS Office. 3 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nYour Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency\u2019s nine- or 13-digit\nfederal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP vendor number\ndiffers from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for administrative purposes\nin connection with this program, and should not be used for IRS purposes.

As part of that agreement, your agency acknowledges that it will comply with\nthese conditions (and, if applicable, additional special or high risk conditions specific to your agency).

If you have additional questions concerning any of these award\nconditions, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. In limited circumstances, your award may be subject to special or high risk conditions that prevent your agency\nfrom drawing down or accessing award funds until the special conditions are satisfied, as determined by the COPS\nOffice.

Allowable Costs\nCondition: The funding under this project is for the payment of approved full-time entry-level salaries and fringe benefits over\nthree years (for a total of 36 months of funding) up to a maximum federal share of $125,000 per officer position for\ncareer law enforcement officer positions hired and/or rehired on or after the official award start date. Any salary\nand fringe benefit costs higher than entry-level that your agency pays a CHP-funded officer must be paid with local\nfunds. Your agency is required to use CHP award funds for the specific hiring categories awarded. Funding under this\nprogram may be used for the following categories:\n\u2022 Hiring new officers, which includes filling existing officer vacancies that are no longer funded in your agency\u2019s\nbudget;\n\u2022 Rehiring officers laid off by any jurisdiction as a result of state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) budget\nreductions; and/or\n\u2022 Rehiring officers who were, at the time of award application, scheduled to be laid off (by your jurisdiction) on\na specific future date as a result of state, local, or BIA budget reductions. If your agency\u2019s local fiscal conditions have changed and your agency needs to change one or more of the funded\nhiring categories, your agency should request an award modification and receive prior approval before spending\nCHP funding under the new category. The Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), included in your award package, specifies the amount of CHP funds\nawarded to your agency. You should carefully review your FCM, which contains the final officer salary and fringe\nbenefit categories and amounts for which your agency was approved. Please note that the salary and fringe benefit\ncosts requested in your CHP application may have been adjusted or removed. Your agency may only be reimbursed\nfor the approved cost categories that are documented within the FCM, up to the amounts specified in the FCM. Your agency may not use CHP funds for any costs that are not identified as allowable in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum. Only actual allowable costs incurred during the award period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown.",

Only actual allowable costs incurred during the award period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown. If\nyour agency experiences any cost savings over the course of the award (for example, your award application\noverestimated the total entry-level officer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use that excess\nfunding to extend the length of the award beyond 36 months. Any funds remaining after your agency has drawn\ndown for the costs of approved salaries and fringe benefits incurred for each awarded position during the 36-month\nfunding period will be deobligated during the closeout process and should not be spent by your agency. 6 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition:\nCHP funds may only be used to pay for entry-level salaries and fringe benefits for 36 months for full-time career\nlaw enforcement officers hired or rehired on or after the award start date. You may use the CHP award to hire or\nrehire experienced officers, but award funding must be limited to paying your agency\u2019s entry-level salary and\nfringe benefits; any costs higher than entry-level must be paid by your agency with local funds. What you should do: All recipients should keep and maintain the most recent, approved version of your 2017 CHP application. To view\nand print this document, you can log into your account at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Please select \u201cCOPS Applications\u201d\nfrom the menu of services and click on the \u201cPrint\u201d icon to download the most recent version of your application in\n.pdf format. Refer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable costs. Salaries covered by CHP must be based on your\nagency\u2019s standard entry-level salary and fringe benefits package under the laws or rules that govern hiring by your\nagency. Salary and fringe benefit payments must be based on payroll records supported by time and attendance\nrecords or their equivalent. Examples of the types of records your agency must keep to document allowable costs\nare described in the section \u201cFinancial Record Management\u201d in this manual. Any additional costs above the\napproved entry-level salaries and fringe benefits are the responsibility of the recipient agency. Civilian positions,\nsalaries and fringe benefits of part-time officer positions, overtime, training, weapons, communication equipment,\nand vehicles cannot be funded with your CHP award. CHP award funding may be used to pay the approved entry-level salaries and fringe benefits of newly hired officer\nrecruits while they are in basic academy training prior to swearing them in if it is your agency\u2019s standard practice to\npay recruits while in training. Please be advised that recipients may not use COPS Office funding for the same item or service also funded by\nanother US Department of Justice award. See also award condition \u201cDuplicative Funding\u201d for more information. 4.

In other words, recipients may not use COPS Office funds\nto supplant (replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to the COPS Office-funded item(s)\nin the absence of the COPS Office award (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796dd-3(a)) . Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds will not be used to replace\nstate or local funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made available\nfor the award purposes. Instead, CHP award funds must be used to increase the total amount of funds that would\notherwise be made available for hiring or rehiring law enforcement officers. 7 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What you should do: Your agency may not reduce its sworn officer budget just to take advantage of the CHP award. Any budget\nreductions must be for fiscal or other reasons unrelated to the receipt of CHP award funds to avoid a violation of\nthe nonsupplanting requirement. Your agency may not reduce its locally funded number of sworn officer positions during the three-year CHP award\nperiod as a direct result of receiving CHP funding. Reductions in locally funded sworn officer positions that occur\nfor reasons unrelated to CHP funding\u2014such as citywide budget reductions\u2014do not violate the nonsupplanting\nrequirement, but your agency must maintain documentation demonstrating the date(s) and reason(s) for the\nbudget reductions to prove that they were unrelated to the receipt of CHP funding in the event of an audit,\nmonitoring site visit, or other form of award compliance review. Under CHP, the nonsupplanting requirement means that a recipient receiving CHP funds to hire a new officer\nposition, including filling an existing officer vacancy that is no longer funded in the recipient\u2019s local budget, must\nhire the additional position on or after the official award start date, above its current budgeted (funded) level of\nsworn officer positions. The nonsupplanting requirement also means that a recipient receiving CHP funds to rehire an officer laid off as a\nresult of state, local, or BIA budget reductions must rehire the officer on or after the official award start date. The\nrecipient must maintain documentation in its CHP award file showing the dates that the officer was laid off and\nrehired. In addition, the nonsupplanting requirement means that a recipient that receives CHP funds to rehire an officer\nwho was, at the time of award application, scheduled to be laid off on a specific future date as a result of state,\nlocal, or BIA budget reductions, must continue to fund the officer with its own funds through the award start date\nuntil the date of the scheduled layoff.",

Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 36 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted nocost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include difficulties in filling COPS Office-funded positions, officer\nturnover, or other circumstances that interrupt the 36 month award funding period. An extension allows your\nagency to compensate for such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding for\neach position awarded. Extension requests must be received prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award.",

However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the award end date. Requests\nto extend the award period must be submitted online and received by the COPS Office before the official award\nend date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will only be considered when the recipient\nprovides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance where an\nunforeseen natural disaster prevented a recipient from requesting an extension. Failure to submit a request for a\nno-cost time extension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the award due to salary and fringe benefit costs that were\nlower than anticipated, your agency may not extend the 36-month funding period for the purpose of expending\nthose excess funds. Recipients are entitled to a maximum of 36 months of federal funding based on the approved\nsalary and fringe benefit costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining award funds during the\ncloseout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time extension, please contact your\nCOPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nDuring the CHP award period, it may become necessary for an agency to modify its CHP award due to changes in an\nagency\u2019s fiscal or law enforcement situation. Modification requests should be submitted to the COPS Office when\nan agency determines that it will need to shift officer positions awarded in one hiring category into a different\nhiring category, reduce the total number of positions awarded, shift funds among benefit categories, and/or reduce\nthe entry-level salary and fringe benefit amounts. For example, an agency may have been awarded CHP funding for\n10 new, additional full-time sworn officer positions, but due to severe fiscal distress/constraints, the agency\ndetermines it is unable to sustain all 10 positions and must reduce its request to five full-time positions; or an\n9 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nagency may have been awarded CHP funding for two new, additional sworn officer positions, but due to fiscal\ndistress/constraints the agency needs to change the hiring category from the new hire category to the rehire\ncategory for officers laid off or scheduled for layoff on a specific future date post-application. Award modifications\nunder CHP are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The COPS Office will only consider a modification request after an\nagency makes final, approved budget and/or personnel decisions. An agency may implement the modified award\nfollowing written approval from the COPS Office. Please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any\nmodification request that results in an increase of federal funds.",

Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of its award programs. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may be\ncarried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may be improved, and why\ncertain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which your\nagency implements its CHP award. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff members or evaluators may study the\neffectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the programs\u2019\neffect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask questions about\n10 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nthe challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel about community policing, and\nhow police feel about their work.

You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and information gathering\nactivities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information about your award activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is\nused to track your agency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to\ngauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government must be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress of\nour programs and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with CHP\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link of the COPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within\n30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the award\nperiod. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period and the\nremaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw\ndown federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however, you will have a 90 day grace\nperiod after the award end date during which you can draw down funds for eligible expenditures incurred before\nthe award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic or financial report submission per\nfiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses, and may be required to\nreceive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in\nthe section \u201cReports\u201d in this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid\nsuspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required reports\nmay also impact future funding opportunities. 11",

Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both\naspects of award implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process\ncoordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include\nsite visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and\naudit resolution. As a COPS Office award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests for\ninformation pertaining to your award. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain a\nmonitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are complying with COPS Office award\nrequirements. In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance to help\nensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients\u2019 compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site Visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to\nconduct site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is\nthree-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare\nfor the review of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period of one or\nmore days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while onsite or, if necessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will have an opportunity to seek\ncustomer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an\nEOBGR conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an\nalternative for conducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall award\nmonitoring strategy. The purpose of the EOBGR is three-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance",

In addition,\naward recipients will have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many\nsources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from the COPS Office Grants Administration Division, the\nCOPS Office Finance Division, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may\nrefer a noncompliance issue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from\nanonymous complainants, media, citizens, law enforcement agencies, other federal agencies, or other\noutside sources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate\ncourse of action to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or\nletter contact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the OIG. Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or\nnonviolation based upon supporting documentation and/or other factors used to make a determination\nfor compliance or noncompliance. Audit Liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event\nyour agency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance and/or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with\nyour agency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may\ninclude repayment of award funds and/or providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance\nand/or providing proof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the\ncauses for the noncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award funds,\nor a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time. Under certain conditions, additional\nactions may include referral and placement on the US Department of Justice\u2019s High Risk List, which will include\nmandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training and being subject to\nincreased monitoring of current and future awards while on the list.",

Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP)\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). 14 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition: It is the experience of the US Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus Crime\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that funds the COPS Office, that \u201cthe full and\nequal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal justice system\nis a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act\u2019s program to reduce crime and delinquency in the United States\u201d\n(28 CFR \u00a7 42.301). EEOPs do not impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private business and has received a single award for $25,000 or\nmore and has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but excluding political\nappointees), then it has to prepare a Utilization Report and submit it to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within 120\ndays from the date of the award. Although the OCR has discretion to review all submitted Utilization Reports, it will\nreview the Utilization Reports from recipients that receive an award of $500,000 or more. To begin developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nhttps://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click EEOP Reporting Tool Login.",

Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and subaward information and\nthe award term provides guidance to report the related information, as required by FFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and systems\nin place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements should it\nreceive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required to report award information\non any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more and, in certain cases, to report information on the names and\ntotal compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the Internet at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool\nthat your agency will use to capture and report subaward information and any executive compensation data\nrequired by FFATA. The subaward information entered in FSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov\nassociated with your agency\u2019s award to further federal spending transparency. For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting requirements, please\nsee Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register, www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-0914/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 17. Debarment and Suspension\nCondition: The recipient agrees not to award federal funds under this program to any party which is debarred or suspended\nfrom participation in Federal assistance programs. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, recipients are required to ensure that federal funds are not given to parties that are\ndebarred or suspended from participation in federal assistance programs. This is to protect the public interest and\nto ensure proper management and integrity in federal activities by conducting business only with responsible\nparties. For details regarding the debarment and suspension requirements, please see 2 C.F.R. Part 180\n(Government-wide Debarment and Suspension), and 2 C.F.R. Part 2867 (DOJ-specific requirements.) What you should do: If, under a COPS Office award, you enter into a contract for goods or services for $25,000 or more or any\nsubaward, you must verify that the vendor or subrecipient and their respective principals (e.g., owners, top\nmanagers) with whom you intend to do business are not excluded or disqualified from participation in federal\nassistance programs. In addition, you must include a term or condition in the contract or subaward requiring the\nvendor or subrecipient to comply with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 C.F.R. Part 180 (Government-wide\nDebarment and Suspension) and subpart C of 2 C.F.R. Part 2867 (DOJ-specific requirements). 21 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual 18.

Your agency may use items funded\nunder the CHP award to assist other law enforcement agencies under a resource sharing, mutual aid, or other\nagreement to address multi-jurisdictional issues as described in the agreement. Why this condition: The CHP award is intended to benefit the communities within the recipient\u2019s primary law enforcement jurisdiction. Therefore, the recipient must use the CHP award funding to benefit its own population, rather than contracting\nout the COPS Office-funded officer(s) to other jurisdictions. What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the CHP award may not provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies unless\nthey will directly benefit the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, a sheriff\u2019s department cannot use a CHP-funded\nofficer to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county but can use the CHP-funded officer to\nprovide direct law enforcement services to towns within its own county. 29 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual 27. Retention\nCondition: At the time of award application, your agency committed to retaining all sworn officer positions awarded under the\nCHP award with state and/or local funds for a minimum of 12 months following the conclusion of 36 months of\nfederal funding for each position, over and above the number of locally funded sworn officer positions that would\nhave existed in the absence of the award. Your agency cannot satisfy the retention requirement by using CHPfunded positions to fill locally funded vacancies resulting from attrition. Why this condition: The retention requirement ensures that the increased officer staffing level under the CHP award continues with\nstate or local funds for a minimum of 12 months after federal funding ends. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was required to affirm that it plans to retain all sworn officer\npositions funded under the CHP award and identify the planned source(s) of retention funding. Your agency\ncommitted to retaining each awarded position for at least 12 months following the conclusion of 36 months of\nfederal funding for that position. The retention period begins for an awarded officer position once that position\nhas completed the 36-month implementation period. If an agency is awarded several officer positions, the\nretention period for each individual officer position begins upon completion of 36 months of funding for that\nposition (not based on the cumulative award end date). The retained CHP-funded position(s) must be added to your agency\u2019s law enforcement budget with state or local\nfunds at the conclusion of award funding, over and above the number of locally funded sworn officer positions that\nwould have existed in the absence of the award. Absorbing CHP-funded positions through attrition (rather than\nadding the extra positions to your budget with additional funding) does not meet the retention requirement.

Throughout the CHP award period, your agency is required to implement the\ncommunity policing plan it set forth in the CHP award application. The COPS Office defines community policing as a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support\nthe systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the immediate conditions\nthat give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime.

Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure that it is initiating or enhancing community\npolicing in accordance with your proposed plan as outlined in section VI (B) of your CHP application and that the\nofficers hired (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance\nyour agency\u2019s community policing activities over the life of the award. The COPS Office may also use this\ninformation to understand the needs of the field and potentially provide for training, technical assistance, problem\nsolving, and community policing implementation tools. What you should do:\nCommunity policing activities to be implemented or enhanced by your agency were identified in your CHP\napplication in section VI (B). While the COPS Office recognizes that your COPS Office-funded officer(s) (or an equal\nnumber of redeployed veteran officers) will participate in some or all aspects of your identified community policing\nstrategy and advance your agency\u2019s community policing activities over the life of the award, we also encourage\nyour agency to move toward an organization-wide philosophy and commitment to community policing. 31 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nYour CHP quarterly progress reports will collect information related to the implementation of and progress toward\nthose community policing activities. Your community policing strategy may be influenced and impacted by others\nwithin and outside your organization; this is considered beneficial to your community policing efforts. Your\ncommunity policing needs may change during the life of your CHP award, and minor changes to this strategy may\nbe made without prior approval of the COPS Office. Any changes to the community policing scope or strategies\noriginally identified in your CHP application should be documented within your quarterly progress report. If your\nagency\u2019s community policing strategy changes significantly, however, you must submit those changes to the COPS\nOffice through the quarterly progress report for approval. Changes are significant if they deviate from the specific\ncrime problem(s) originally identified and approved in the original community policing strategy submitted with\nyour application. Recipients who chose \u201cIllegal Immigration\u201d, \u201cViolent Crime\u201d, or \u201cHomeland Security\u201d\u201cas their\ncommunity policing problem/focus area will not be able to change the problem/focus area of their community\npolicing strategies post-award.

Additional information about this requirement may\nbe found in the appendices of this manual. 29. Local Match\nCondition:\nRecipients are required to contribute a local match of at least 25 percent toward the total cost of the approved\naward project, unless waived in writing by the COPS Office. The local match must be a cash match from funds not\npreviously budgeted for law enforcement purposes and must be paid during the award period. The local match\ncontribution must be made on an increasing basis during each year of the three-year award period, with the federal\nshare decreasing accordingly. Why this condition: The 2017 CHP provides up to 75 percent of the allowable costs of this award project (up to a maximum federal\nshare of $125,000 per officer position). Recipients are responsible for providing at least 25 percent of the total\nproject costs in local matching funds. The local match must be a cash match made from local, state, or other nonCOPS Office funds. Federal funds (other than COPS Office funds) may be used to meet your local match only if the\nfederal funds are authorized by statute for that purpose and approved in writing by both the federal agency\nproviding those funds and the COPS Office. What you should do:\nMatching contributions must be made on an increasing basis during each year of the three-year program with the\nfederal share decreasing accordingly. The local match must be paid in full during the active award period;\npayments made prior to the CHP award start date or after the award end date do not qualify as a local match. Recipients are strongly encouraged to pay local match during each quarterly financial reporting period to avoid\npotential noncompliance. If your agency must withdraw from the award period prior to the end of award funding, 32 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nyour agency is responsible for ensuring that the federal share of funds expended is limited to a maximum of 75\npercent of the total program costs expended. If you have questions about the timing of your local match\npayments, please contact your COPS Office Staff Accountant at 800-421-6770. Your agency must maintain records that clearly demonstrate the source of the local match, the amount of the local\nmatch, and when the local match was contributed. The local match must be in addition to funds previously\nbudgeted for specific law enforcement purposes as indicated on your agency\u2019s fiscal year budget.",

You do not need\nto provide these supporting documents to the COPS Office, but such records must be produced in the event of an\naudit, monitoring site visit, or office-based grant review. In addition, recipients are required to report the amount\nof local match contributed on the quarterly Federal Financial Report (SF-425), line j. Sources for local match requirements may include the following:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Funds contributed by private sources; Funds from federal programs whose statutes specifically authorize their use as matching funds; Funds from state or local governments that are committed to matching funds for your program; and/or\nNonfederal asset forfeiture funds (subject to approval from the state or local oversight agency). To maximize the number of communities that would be able to take advantage of CHP award funding, only a\nlimited number of local match waiver requests were granted to applicants who were able to demonstrate severe\nfiscal distress. The COPS Office relied on the fiscal health data provided in section 7 of the CHP application and a\ncomparison of the applicant\u2019s fiscal health data with that of the overall 2017 CHP applicant pool to make waiver\ndecisions. 30. School Resource Officer (SRO) Training Requirement\nCondition:\nCOPS Office-funded SRO(s) are required to complete a National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO)\nbasic training course no later than nine months after the date shown on the award congratulatory letter.

This new SRO must\ncomplete the training no later than nine months after being placed in the schools. Why this condition: This NASRO basic training course is intended not only to provide information on various important school safety\ntopics, but is also designed to promote effective collaboration and partnerships among the school, law\nenforcement agency and other entities. The COPS Office will pay the training fee directly to NASRO and pay allowable travel costs (airfare, hotel, and per\ndiem) up to $1,000 per COPS Office-funded SRO. Any travel costs over this amount must be paid for by the\nrecipient. The COPS Office will provide the recipient with contact information that must be used to arrange for\nclass registration and travel reimbursement. 33 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What you should do: The recipient must ensure all COPS Office-funded SROs complete the NASRO training no later than nine months\nafter the date on the award congratulatory letter.

What are the specific rules regarding termination of award funding? The COPS Office has the right to sanction or terminate your agency\u2019s project when there is reason to believe that\nyour agency is\n\u2022 failing to make satisfactory progress toward the goals or strategies outlined in its application;\n\u2022 filing false statements or certifications in connection with an application, periodic report, or other awardrelated documents;\n\u2022 not adhering to award requirements or conditions;\n\u2022 not submitting financial or programmatic reports in a timely manner;\n\u2022 not substantially complying with the award requirements or other applicable provisions of federal law;\n\u2022 proposing substantial plan changes to the extent that, if originally submitted, would have resulted in the\napplication being denied funding;\n\u2022 providing other good cause for sanctions or termination as determined by the COPS Office. In these instances, the COPS Office may\n\u2022 condition a future award or elect not to provide future award funds to your agency until appropriate actions\nare taken to ensure compliance;\n\u2022 disallow all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance;\n\u2022 recommend civil or criminal enforcement by other agencies;\n\u2022 require that some or all of the award funds be remitted to the US Department of Justice;\n\u2022 temporarily withhold payments pending correction of the situation by your agency;\n\u2022 wholly or partly suspend or terminate your award;\n\u2022 withhold or restrict your agency from obtaining future awards;\n\u2022 take other remedies that may be legally available. 34 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual In the event that sanctions are imposed or your award is terminated, your agency will be notified in writing of our\ndecision and the reason(s) for that decision.",

Accepting the award After you have reviewed the conditions of your CHP award and your agency agrees with these conditions, you are\nready to accept the award. The Director of the COPS Office has signed the award document indicating approval of\nyour award, an obligation of federal funds to your organization, and our commitment to the award. As stated at\nthe beginning of this section, to officially begin your award and draw down your funds, the authorized officials (see\nthe Glossary of Terms in the appendices) of your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount\nAccess\u201d link in the upper-right corner to log in, review, and electronically sign the award document with the award\nterms and conditions; the Financial Clearance Memorandum and, if applicable, the special award conditions and\nhigh risk conditions in the award document supplement within 90 days of the date shown on the award\ncongratulatory letter. Who should sign the award document for our agency? The authorized officials are the law enforcement and government executives who have ultimate and final\nresponsibility for all programmatic and financial decisions regarding this award as representatives of the legal\nrecipient. COPS Office awards require that both the top law enforcement executive (e.g., chief of police, sheriff, or\nequivalent) and the top government executive (e.g., mayor, board chairman, or equivalent) sign the award\ndocument. For non-law enforcement agencies (universities, etc.), the authorized officials are the programmatic\nand financial officials who have the ultimate signatory authority to sign contracts on behalf of your organization. Typically, these are the same executives named on your agency\u2019s 2017 CHP application. If one or both of these\nindividuals have changed, please update your \u201cAgency Contacts\u201d online at www.cops.usdoj.gov through the\n\u201cAccount Access\u201d link and create accounts for them so that they may electronically sign the award.

Award funds will not be released until we have received your agency\u2019s signed award\ndocument, your budget has received final clearance, and any other relevant award conditions particular to your\nagency have been satisfied. Failure to submit your signed award document within the 90-day award acceptance\nperiod may result in your CHP award being withdrawn and the funds deobligated without additional notification.

For assistance with financial management and award administration, please contact the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one payment system available for accessing federal award funds\u2014the Grant Payment Request\nSystem (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables recipients to use a secure Internet connection to request\nfunds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States Department\nof the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the primary system\nthat agencies use for EFT. A recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made since July 2009. For\nmore information regarding GPRS, please go to www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/\noffices/ocfogprs.htm to view the User Guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a new GPRS account? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s) will be\nresponsible for requesting federal funds for your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The individual(s)\nselected must click on the following link and register with the GPRS system to become a drawdown specialist for\nyour agency: https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome. Once you have been approved, you will receive an e-mail containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement\nexecutive and/or government executive or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process. All individuals who need access to GPRS must register separately and\ncreate their own unique GPRS username account, as these accounts are not meant to be shared. How do we add an award to an existing GPRS account? If you are currently registered for an active COPS Office award username in GPRS and would like to add a recently\nfunded COPS Office award number to your existing COPS Office award username, contact the COPS Office GPRS\nregistration team via e-mail at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 User name (for COPS Office awards) First/last name\nVendor number (as listed on your award document)\nAward number(s) to be added 36 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual How do we fill out the payment enrollment forms?",

If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated Clearinghouse\n(ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on the COPS Office\nwebsite at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf. Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 Your agency must complete the \u201cPayee/Company Information\u201d section following the directions on the back of the\nform and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial institution must\ncomplete the \u201cFinancial Institution Information\u201d section and have the appropriate financial official sign the form. If you are already a COPS Office award recipient, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long as\nyour OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment form\ninformation, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Staff Accountant. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you are\nrequired to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFRs) using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able to make\ndrawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the COPS\nOffice by the deadline date. Recipients are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at\nhttps://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see the section of this\nmanual, titled \u201cReports\u201d. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. 37 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nearlier.

As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once.

These records must include both federal funds\nand any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? As required by 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your\naccounting system should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the\nfollowing objectives for federal awards:\n\u2022 Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. \u2022 Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. \u2022 Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your CHP award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, cancelled checks, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your CHP award (including payroll, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, and purchase orders) must be retained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 CFR \u00a7200.333 (Retention requirements for\nrecords). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever you\nfind more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving these records has been\nstarted before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These\nrecords should be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to\nmaintain adequate records to document award expenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds\nthat cannot be supported with appropriate records. 39 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What if we have more than one award? If your agency has more than one COPS Office award or an award from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization from the\nCOPS Office, or in the case of an award from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your accounting\nsystems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the US Department of Justice, the Comptroller\nGeneral of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may access these\nrecords for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 40 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual",

Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The\ntwo primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and US Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving federal\nfinancial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on June 26,\n2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and reporting\nrequirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 CFR Part 200\u2014Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) on\nDecember 26, 2013. This guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments awarded on or after\nDecember 26, 2014 and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of SAA requirements. 2 C.F.R.\nPart 200, Subpart F \u2013 Audit Requirements, available at www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl, establishes the requirements for organizational audits that\napply to COPS Office award recipients. Recipients must arrange for the required organization-wide (not award-byaward) audit in accordance with the requirements of Subpart F. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7200.514 (Scope of audit) except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or a\nvendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute in\neffect on January 1, 1987 to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit is\nto express opinions on the recipient\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address specific\ncompliance issues with respect to COPS Office award requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, federal\nagencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.338 (Remedies for\nnoncompliance). See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.505. These sanctions under \u00a7200.338 could include the following:\n\u2022 Disallowing (that is, denying both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of\nthe activity or action not in compliance\n\u2022 Initiating suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 CFR part 180 and federal awarding\nagency regulations (or in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding be initiated by a\nfederal awarding agency) 41 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\n\u2022 Temporarily withholding cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or\nmore severe enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity\n\u2022 Wholly or partly suspending or terminating the federal award\n\u2022",

Questions and comments regarding SAA audits may be\ndirected to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the OIG for award audits? The OIG is a separate component of the US Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits are\ndesigned to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on an\nannual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the\nOIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the geographical distribution of\nawards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and expired), and type of award (hiring\nand non-hiring). As such, the fact that a recipient has been selected for an OIG audit is not necessarily indicative of\na suspected concern or problem area. 42 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What are the steps in an OIG audit? The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Audit Liaison Section serves as the liaison between recipients and the\nOIG\u2019s Audit Division, which conducts the audit.

Recipient incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget or a budget\nmodification, were in excess of the approved budget, or were charged to the award after the expiration date\nand an award extension was not obtained. \u2022 Unsupported costs. Specific award expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by adequate\ndocumentation (including but not limited to receipts or purchase orders), that may have been allowable\nunder the program, but for which no prior written approval was obtained from the COPS Office, or award\nexpenditures were in excess of actual approved award costs. \u2022 Lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Recipient failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. \u2022 Failure to retain. Recipient lacked documentation to support retention planning efforts during the award\nperiod and/or failed to demonstrate an increase in the baseline of locally funded sworn officer positions at\nthe conclusion of the 36 months of federal funding, over and above what the recipient would have funded in\nabsence of the award. \u2022 Supplanting. Recipient could not document efforts to backfill vacant local sworn officer positions, or recipient\ncould not explain reductions in local law enforcement budget or in sworn officer positions during the award\nperiod. \u2022 Lack of adequate community policing. Recipient had difficulty demonstrating community policing activities. 43 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\n\u2022 Funds to better use.

Reports As part of CHP, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as quarterly\nProgrammatic Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CHP funding separately\nfrom other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal awards) to ensure accurate financial and\nprogrammatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial internal controls in\nplace to monitor the use of CHP funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms and conditions. Good stewardship in this area includes written accounting practices and use of an accounting system that tracks all\naward drawdowns and expenditures and has the ability to track when CHP award-funded positions are filled or\nvacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit complete reports, or submit them\nin a timely manner, may result in the suspension and possible termination of your agency\u2019s COPS Office award\nfunding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within 30\ndays after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the award\nperiod.

How do we file a Federal Financial Report (SF-425)? All COPS Office award recipients are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Award recipients are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office website at\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link in the upper-right corner to log in; once you are logged\nin, select \u201cApplications\u201d from the agency portal menu, click on the \u201cSF-425\u201d icon, and follow the instructions to\ncomplete and submit your reports. The online SF-425 requires the same reporting information as the paper\nversion. The use of this online application enables authorized users to view past SF-425s and allows them to file or\namend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports (SF-425) due?

In addition, once you have completed your final\ndrawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of federal funds drawn down by your agency. The\nfinal SF-425 should also report the total amount of the local cash match contributed over the 36-month award\nperiod, which should be at least 25 percent of the total award project, unless waived by the COPS Office in writing. When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency has incurred but has\nnot yet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the award period to request reimbursement for funds\nobligated. Please be advised that 2 CFR Part 200.343(a) requires recipients to submit final SF-425s and 2 CFR Part 200.343(b)\nrequires recipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of\nthe award. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance.

Community policing defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies and supports the systematic use of\npartnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to\npublic safety issues such as crime, fear of crime, and social disorder. Problem solving\nProblem solving is the process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to\ndevelop effective responses that are evaluated rigorously. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems\nAnalysis: Analyzing problems\nResponse: Responding to problems\nAssessment: Assessing problem-solving initiatives Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location) Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions\nto the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused\ninto all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about\ntheir responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A major conceptual\nvehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way is the SARA\n(Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the\nscope of severity, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the selected problem is\ntypically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents similar in one or more\nways, and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a place, a\nperson or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these.",

      "content": "Problems can be a type of behavior, a place, a\nperson or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from the\ncommunity, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Analyzing\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding of\nthe dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish correlation,\nand develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to find out as much\nas possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who? what? when? where? how? why? and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. 61 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Response: Responding to problems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an identified\nproblem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response should follow\nlogically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific problem. The goals\nof the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially reducing the problem to\nreducing the amount of harm caused by the problem or improving the quality of community cohesion. Assessment: Assessing problem-solving initiatives\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by determining if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but also\ngathers data that builds knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process, outcomes,\nor both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis should be\nreviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and tested. The\nentire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim, offender,\nand location (the crime triangle) and those aspects that could have an impact on them\u2014for example, capable\nguardians for victims, handlers for offenders, and managers for locations. Rather than addressing root causes of a\nproblem, the police focus on the factors that are within their reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and\naccess to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating risk with unwanted behavior.

Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify community\nconcerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies, prosecutors, probation\nand parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies, health and human\nservices departments, child support, ordinance enforcement, and schools. 62 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Community members and groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. Partnerships with these factions of the community can engage the community in\nachieving specific goals at town hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized\noffices/storefronts in the community, and team beat assignments. Nonprofits and service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its behalf\ncan be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share certain\ninterests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups, advocacy\ngroups, and the faith community. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because they\noften bring considerable resources to bear on problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify problems\nand provide resources for responses, often including their own security apparatus and community outreach. The\nlocal chamber of commerce can also assist in disseminating information about police and business partnerships\nand initiatives. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. It can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community agencies\nor new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on public\nperceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime.

Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the entire\ndepartment, including the way the department is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management needs to infuse community policing ideals throughout\nthe agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem solving\nand partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and communication that\ntake place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing, and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the dominant way of doing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor need to be a part\nof the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor\ngroups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing\nimplementation. 64 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nDecision making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and in decision making. Decentralized\ndecision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision making\ninvolves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving efforts, and\nallowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various\nresources to attack a problem and allowing the officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the\ncommunity will help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan is to\nhave value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their\nefforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and value statement should be\nsimple and communicated widely. Everything should connect back to this plan. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures\nwhere appropriate. Organizational evaluations",

Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures\nwhere appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime rates),\ncommunity policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include increased community\nsatisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality of life. Community policing\ncalls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks not only at measured outcomes but also at\nhow feedback information is used. Transparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the\ncommunity is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant information on\ncrime and social disorder problems, as well as police operations with the community. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensures that local patrol officers have decisionmaking authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term assignments, the\ndevelopment of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. 65 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nGeographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers in specific neighborhoods or\nareas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance customer service and facilitate more contact between\npolice and citizens, thus establishing strong relationships and mutual accountability. Beat boundaries should\ncorrespond to neighborhood boundaries, and other government services should recognize these boundaries when\ncoordinating government public-service activities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers must be able to handle multiple responsibilities and take a team\napproach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the community. Community policing encourages its\nadoption agency-wide, not just in special units, although there may be a need for specialist units that are tasked\nwith identifying and solving particularly complex problems or managing complex partnerships. Resources and finances\nAgencies must devote the necessary human and financial resources to support community policing to ensure that\nproblem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustainable and effective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency,\nincluding recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff including sworn officers,\nnonsworn officers, civilians, and volunteers, as well as personnel evaluations, supervision, and training. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment, selection,\nand hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving responsibilities\nand encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service, not just a spirit of adventure. A community\npolicing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it looks for recruits, whom it is recruiting and hiring, and\nwhat is being tested. Some community policing agencies also look for the involvement of the community in this\nprocess through the identification of competencies and participation in review boards.

Some community policing agencies also look for the involvement of the community in this\nprocess through the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations Tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are incorporated into job\ndescriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional structures should support sound problem-solving activities,\nproactive policing and community collaboration, and citizen satisfaction with police services. Training\nTraining at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles and tactics. It\nalso needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to (a) identify\nand correct conditions that could lead to crime, (b) raise public awareness, and (c) engage the community in 66 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nfinding solutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors can encourage problem solving and help\nofficers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized within the\norganization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information systems (technology) Community policing is information-intensive and technology plays a central role in providing ready access to\nquality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective and ensures\nthat officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their beat. In addition, technological\nenhancements can greatly assist with improving two-way communication with citizens and developing agency\naccountability systems and performance outcome measures. Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with the ability to communicate externally with the public and internally with their\nown staff. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages agencies to develop two-way\ncommunication systems through the Internet to provide online reports, reverse 911 and e-mail alerts, discussion\nforums, and feedback on interactive applications (surveys, maps), thereby creating ongoing dialogs and increasing\ntransparency. Technology also encourages effective internal communication through memos, reports, newsletters, e-mail and\nenhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other entities for more\nefficient operations. Community policing advocates the use of technology to develop accountability and\nperformance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a broad array of measures\nand information. Community policing also promotes the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely\ninformation on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers in their\npatrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem analysis functions\nby enabling agencies to gather information on greater aspects of events including more detailed information on\noffenders, victims, crime locations, and quality-of-life concerns, and to further enhance analysis. Quality and accuracy of data Information is only as good as its source; therefore it is not useful if it is not high quality and accurate.",

When schools,\ncommunities, and law enforcement agencies work together to creatively tackle problems, they may be able to\nachieve a number of positive outcomes, including the following:\n\u2022 An increased ability of law enforcement agencies, schools, and community groups to gather and analyze\nuseful and timely information about crime and fear of crime in schools in accordance with applicable privacy\nlaws;\n\u2022 An increased ability of law enforcement agencies, schools, and community groups to work together in\ndeveloping innovative, systemic, long-term approaches to reducing and preventing different kinds of crime in\nand around their schools and preventing unnecessary law enforcement involvement in non-criminal student\nmisbehavior. Measurable outcomes may be determined by implementing strategies focused on targeted\ncrimes, thereby improving the quality of life for those affected (students, teachers, school personnel, and\nparents), promoting a safer environment that is conducive for learning, and decreasing the fear of crime and\nviolence among students, school employees, and the surrounding community;\n\u2022 An increased understanding of how to effectively interact with youth through coordinated training on topics\nsuch as basic childhood and adolescent development and age-appropriate responses, disability and special\neducation issues, conflict resolution and de-escalation techniques, bias-free policing including implicit bias\nand cultural competence, restorative justice techniques, and working with specific student groups such as\nstudents with disabilities or limited English proficiency and students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT);\n\u2022 An increased understanding of an SRO\u2019s roles and responsibilities, including an understanding that school\ncode of conduct violations and routine discipline of students remains the responsibility of school administrators and that law enforcement actions (such as arrest, citations, ticketing, or court referrals) are only to be\nused as a last resort for incidents that involve criminal behavior or when it becomes necessary to protect the\nsafety of students, faculty, and staff from the threat of immediate harm;\n\u2022 An increased ability through coordinated training for schools and law enforcement agencies to properly train\nand respond to school safety threats;\n\u2022 An increased ability to plan for and respond appropriately to emergencies.

The MOU\nmust be submitted to the COPS Office within 90 days of the date shown on the award congratulatory letter. The\nimplementation of the CHP award without submission and acceptance of the required MOU may result in\nexpenditures not being reimbursed by the COPS Office and/or award de-obligation. The following information\nshould be included within an MOU. Purpose of the MOU This statement may already exist within your ongoing partnership or may need to be developed jointly to assist in\ndefining the primary purpose of your partnership. The statement of purpose should describe the agencies that are\nentering into the partnership and the effective date of the agreement. Description of partner roles and responsibilities This description must include the roles and responsibilities of the school, the school district, and the law enforcement agency, and each partner should be specifically listed within the document. It must clearly indicate that SROs\nwill not be responsible for requests to resolve routine discipline problems involving students. The administration of\nstudent discipline, including student code of conduct violations and student misbehavior, is the responsibility of\nschool administrators unless the violation or misbehavior involves criminal conduct. The placement of law enforcement officers in schools carries a risk of contributing to a \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d\nprocess where students are arrested or cited for minor, nonviolent behavioral violations and then diverted to the\njuvenile court system. This pipeline wastes community resources and can lead to academic failure and greater\nrecidivism rates for these students. Recipient agrees that any officers deployed while implementing school-based\npolicing under the COPS Hiring Program award cannot be involved in the administrative discipline of the students. The MOU must include the roles and responsibilities of the school partner. These roles may include providing a\nsecure work space for the SRO to conduct interviews and maintain confidential records; establishing standing\nmeetings; and working with school administrators in identifying problems and evaluating progress under the MOU,\nincluding data collection and evaluation.",
