Pursuant to 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.330, a subaward is for the purpose of carrying out a portion of the federal award, and a\ncontract is for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the recipient\u2019s own use. The substance of the\nrelationship is more important than the form of the agreement in determining whether the recipient of the passthrough funds is a subrecipient or a contractor. Keep in mind that the awarding and monitoring of contracts must\nfollow documented procurement procedures, including full and open competition, pursuant to the procurement\nstandards in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.317 \u2013 200.326, and the issuance of subawards must meet the requirements of 2 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 200.331. Any recipient of an award will be responsible for monitoring subawards and contracts in accordance with all\napplicable statutes, regulations, and guidelines. Primary recipients will be responsible for oversight of subrecipient\nor partner spending and monitoring specific performance measures and outcomes attributable to the use of COPS\nOffice funds. All sole-source procurements of goods and services (those not awarded competitively) in excess of $250,000\nrequire prior approval from the COPS Office. Please see the Sole Source Justification fact sheet at\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov/svpp#programdocuments. 7 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nConsultant expenses include goods or services that directly contribute to the implementation or enhancement of\nthe project. The use of a consultant should be more economical than direct employment. Compensation for\nindividual consultant services procured under a COPS Office award must be reasonable and allocable in accordance\nwith Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cost principles, and consistent with that paid for similar services in\nthe marketplace. The services should be commensurate with the rate or salary paid by the primary employer. Unless otherwise approved by the COPS Office, independent consultant rates will be approved based on the salary\na consultant receives from his or her primary employer, as applicable, up to $650 per day (or $81.25 per hour). Please note that this does not mean that the rate can or should be as high as $650 for all consultants. If individuals\nreceive fringe benefits from their primary employer, such fringe benefit costs should not be included in the\ncalculation of consultant rates. A consultant rate justification will need to be submitted for review and approval to\nthe COPS Office for any consultants hired through a noncompetitive bidding process and paid more than $650 per\nday prior to incurring any costs. Determinations of approval will be made on a case-by-case basis.

See also award condition 13, \u201cDuplicative Funding.\u201d 8 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual 4. Comprehensive School Safety Assessments\nCondition:\nRecipients awarded funding through the SVPP must conduct comprehensive school safety assessments for all\nschools involved in the funded project within the 24-month grant implementation period. The assessments should\nbe completed as soon as possible as they can be used as strategic evaluation tools to identify school safety issues\nand potential resolutions. This condition can be waived for recipients that can demonstrate that comprehensive\nschool safety assessments have already been performed or updated within the previous three years. The COPS\nOffice will monitor SVPP grants to ensure that recipients comply with this condition. Why this condition: In order for school safety interventions to be most effective, they should be incorporated into broader school\nsafety planning and assessment efforts and be designed to meet the unique individualized needs of each school\nand challenges of each jurisdiction and each school at which they will be implemented. Comprehensive school\nsafety assessments examine the overall safety, accessibility and emergency preparedness of school buildings and\nground and are essential to school safety decision making. Information about conducting site assessments,\nincluding free assessment software can be found at https://rems.ed.gov/SITEASSESS.aspx. What you should do:\nAgencies should keep record of the date(s) of the assessment(s) as well as specific areas of the school(s) where\nproblems were identified and the proposed (if any) recommendations for resolution. Participants (law\nenforcement, teachers, students, any staff, et cetera) should also be included. Please contact your Grant Program\nSpecialist at 800-421-6770 or at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov.",

Please contact your Grant Program\nSpecialist at 800-421-6770 or at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable\njustification for delays will be granted no-cost extensions. Extension requests must be received prior to the end date\nof the award. 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.308(d)(2). Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. When justified, the COPS Office will seek to accommodate reasonable\nrequests for no-cost time extensions to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed. Requests to extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before\nthe official award end date. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension before the award end date\nmay result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. Please note that the project period of 9 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nperformance will be extended, if necessary, until the deliverable is considered final. If the award is set to expire,\nprior to the final approval of the deliverable, a no-cost extension will be executed for a reasonable amount of time\nfor the recipient to complete the final deliverable. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nAward modifications under the SVPP are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.308. For federal awards in excess of $250,000, any modification request involving the reallocation of funding between\nbudget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of the total approved budget requires\nprior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award amount or budget modification\npercentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In addition, all modification\nrequests involving new budget items or any budget modification that changes the scope of the project requires\nprior written approval by the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Please be aware that the COPS Office will\nnot approve any modification request that results in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you are required to expend federal\nfunds only as approved in the FCM. Requests to change or alter an award that meet certain threshold\nrequirements must be submitted to the COPS Office for written approval, prior to their purchase or\nimplementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it was originally\noutlined and accepted by your agency.",

Your agency may reprogram its budget up to an aggregate (over the course of your project) of 10 percent of the\ntotal project cost without prior written approval from the COPS Office. However, you should notify your COPS\nOffice Grant Program Specialist of any reprogramming that falls below the 10 percent threshold as well. For\nawards in excess of $250,000, any reprogramming of funds that totals an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the\napproved budget requires prior written approval from the COPS Office. What you should do: You are required to notify your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist if you determine that your agency will need\nto reprogram award funds.

Please contact your Grant Program Specialist with questions. 7. Information Sharing with Law Enforcement\nCondition:\nRecipients are required to ensure that schools within their jurisdiction share school threat information and data\nwith the appropriate local law enforcement agencies. Why this condition:\nPreventing and responding to school violence requires meaningful partnerships and information sharing with\nvarious community stakeholders, especially schools and law enforcement. What you should do:\nSchool threat information should be shared with appropriate local law enforcement agencies as soon as possible to\nensure that there is adequate situational awareness to evaluate and respond to threats in a timely manner. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). 2 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 200.327 \u2013\n200.328.",

The progress report is used to track your agency\u2019s progress toward implementing school safety strategies\nand to collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing the recipient\u2019s capacity to improve school safety\nthrough COPS Office funding. The Federal Financial Report is used to track the expenditures of the recipient\u2019s award\nfunds on a cumulative basis throughout the life of the award. Why this condition:\nFederal regulations and policies require that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government must be\nmonitored carefully to ensure the proper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on\na continuing basis, the progress of our programs and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with SVPP\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d tab on the COPS Office website at\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard\nForm 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days\nafter the end of the award period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during\nthe funding period, and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your 11 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date;\nhowever, you will have a 90-day grace period after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for\neligible expenditures incurred before the award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic\nor financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable\nexpenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports\nare discussed in greater detail in the section titled \u201cReporting Requirements\u201d in this manual. All reports should be\nsubmitted within the deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial\nactions; failure to submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal regulations requires that recipients receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be monitored to\nensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutes and regulations. The COPS Office is\nalso interested in tracking the progress of our programs and implementing evidence-based school safety strategies\nand programs. Both aspects of award implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the\nmonitoring process coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the\nCOPS Office may include site visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and\nprogrammatic reporting, and audit resolution.",

As a COPS Office award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and\nrespond to any requests for information pertaining to your award. This includes all financial records, such as\ngeneral accounting ledgers and all supporting documents. All information pertinent to the implementation of the\naward is subject to agency review throughout the life of the award, during the close-out process and for three-years\nafter submission of the final expenditure report. 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.328(e), and 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.333 and 200.336. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are complying with COPS Office award requirements. In addition,\nthe monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance to help ensure recipients\nunderstand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and nonroutine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients\u2019 compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\nSite visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to conduct site\nvisits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is threefold:\n1.\n2.\n3. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review implementation of evidence-based school safety strategies and programs To provide customer service and technical assistance 12 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare for the\nreview of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period of one or more days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while on-site or, if necessary,\nfollowing the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or\ntechnical assistance on the implementation of their award. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an EOBGR\nconducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative for\nconducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall award monitoring strategy. The\npurpose of the EOBGR is threefold:\n1.\n2.\n3. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review implementation of evidence-based school safety strategies and programs To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards.

In addition, award recipients will also have an\nopportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that originates\nfrom an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs\ngenerally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance Division, or the COPS\nOffice Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a noncompliance issue to the ANCR. External\nnoncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media, citizens, law enforcement\nagencies, other Federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office ANCR staff\nmembers determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the OIG. Each ANCR referral is\nresolved as a violation or nonviolation based upon the preponderance of the supporting documentation or other\nfacts to determine if the award recipient is in compliance or noncompliance. Audit liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event your\nagency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from noncompliance\nor poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with your agency to resolve and\nclose these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may include repayment of award funds,\nproviding adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance, or providing proof of policies or procedures that\nwere created or revised to directly address the causes for the noncompliance as a proactive preventative measure\nto avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award funds,\nor a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time.

      "content": "14 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition: In establishing financial assistance programs, Congress linked the receipt of federal funding to compliance with\nfederal civil rights and nondiscrimination laws. As a result, recipients are required to comply with the civil rights\nand nondiscrimination laws referenced above. A hold may be placed on your award if it is deemed that your\nagency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an ongoing federal civil rights\ninvestigation. If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate or draw down federal funds under\nyour agency\u2019s COPS Office award until you comply with federal civil rights laws or cooperate with any ongoing\nfederal civil rights investigation. What you should do:\nIncluded with your award package is a memorandum from the Office for Civil Rights, Office of Justice Programs,\nU.S. Department of Justice, which addresses the federal civil rights statutes and regulations applicable to your\naward. You should review this memorandum to understand your agency\u2019s civil rights responsibilities. As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the applicable\nfederal civil rights and nondiscrimination laws to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective\nenforcement of such laws, and to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes providing\naccess to records, accounts, documents, information, facilities, and staff. 11. Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP)\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan. 28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E.\nWhy this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus Crime\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that established the COPS Office, that \u201cthe full\nand equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal justice\nsystem is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act\u2019s program to reduce crime and delinquency in the United\nStates\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.301. The Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) does not impose quotas or hiring\nrequirements on recipients of federal funds. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private\nbusiness and has received a single award for $25,000 or more and has fifty or more employees (counting both fulland part-time employees but excluding political appointees), then it has to prepare a Utilization Report and submit\nit to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within 120 days from the date of the award. Although the OCR has discretion\nto review all submitted Utilization Reports, it will review the Utilization Reports from recipients that receive an\naward of $500,000 or more. 15 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual",

Why this condition: To further federal spending transparency, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006\n(FFATA) requires, among other things, that information on federal awards (federal financial assistance and\nexpenditures) be made available to the public via a single, searchable website, which is www.USASpending.gov. Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and subaward information, and\nthe award term provides guidance to report the related information as required by FFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and systems\nin place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements should it\nreceive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required to report award information\non any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to report information on the names and\ntotal compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the website at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool\nthat your agency will use to capture and report subaward information and any executive compensation data\nrequired by FFATA. The subaward information entered in FSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov\nassociated with your agency\u2019s award, furthering federal spending transparency.

The COPS Office authorizes noncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the recipient. The item/service is available only from one source. The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive\nsolicitation. The COPS Office will review your request and the supporting information that you provide and will make a\ndetermination as to whether or not an exception can be made to the general rule regarding competition.

GPRS is a web-based system that enables recipients to use a secure Internet connection to request\nfunds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States Department\nof the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the primary system\nthat agencies use for EFT. An award recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made since July\n2009. For more information regarding GPRS, please visit the following website:\nhttps://ojp.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm. Setting up your account How do we set up a new GPRS account? If you are a new award recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s)\nwill be responsible for requesting federal funds for your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The\nindividual(s) selected must click on the following link and register with the GPRS system to become a drawdown\nspecialist for your agency: https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome. All individuals that need access to GPRS\nmust register separately and create their own unique GPRS username account, as these accounts are not meant to\nbe shared. Once you have been approved, you will receive an email containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your Law Enforcement\nExecutive, Government Executive, or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process. Once you receive your temporary password, you should login to the GPRS\nwebsite and change your temporary password to a permanent password. If you ever have an issue regarding your\nGPRS password, you have the option to utilize the \u201cForgot Password\u201d link on the webpage. It will email you a new\ntemporary password. If this does not work, please contact the GMS Helpdesk (888-549-9901, option 3) for a\npassword reset for GPRS with the username you selected upon registration.

When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? Current regulations state that all COPS Office award recipients are required to submit their initial Federal Financial\nReport (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) at the end of the period that includes the award start date,\nregardless of when the award was accepted, and thereafter, at the end of every calendar quarter, regardless of\naward activity.

You will not be able to make drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 report for\nthe most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Recipients are\nencouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425 report, see the section in\nthis manual titled \u201cReporting Requirements.\u201d 41 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nFiling the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances.",

How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements; however, your reimbursement\nrequests should cover a specific time frame and include only costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM). As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once. Can we earn interest on our award funds? For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified at 31\nC.F.R.

For nonfederal entities other than states, payment methods must minimize the time between your drawdown of\nfederal funds and your payment of award costs to avoid earning excess interest on your award funds. You must\naccount for interest earned on advances of federal funds as follows:\n\u2022 The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance at 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.305(b)(9) states that\ninterest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year\nmay be retained by the nonfederal entity for administrative expenses. \u2022 Any interest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts that is in excess of\n$500 per year must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment\nManagement System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nnetwork or a Fedwire Funds Service payment.

Financial Record Maintenance Under the COPS Office SVPP, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial\nrecords to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include both federal funds\nand any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for\nthe funds awarded. As required by 2.C.F.R. \u00a7 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your\naccounting system should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the\nfollowing objectives for federal awards:\n\u2022 Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. \u2022 Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. \u2022 Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your SVPP award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your SVPP award (including payroll, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, and purchase orders) must be retained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 C.F.R \u00a7C.F.R. \u00a7 200.333 (Retention requirements\nfor records).

If your agency has more than one COPS Office award or an award from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization from the\nCOPS Office, or in the case of an award from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your accounting\nsystems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Comptroller\nGeneral of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may access these\nrecords for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 45 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual V. Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The\ntwo primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving federal\nfinancial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on June 26,\n2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and reporting\nrequirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 C.F.R. Part 200\u2014Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) on\nDecember 26, 2013. This guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments awarded on or after\nDecember 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of SAA requirements. 2\nC.F.R. Part 200, Subpart F \u2013 Audit Requirements, available at www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl, establishes the requirements for organizational audits that\napply to COPS Office award recipients. Recipients must arrange for the required organization-wide (not award-byaward) audit in accordance with the requirements of Subpart F. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.514 (Scope of audit) except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.501(c).",

An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually.

The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on an\nannual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the\nOIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the geographical distribution of\nawards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and expired), and type of award (hiring\nand nonhiring). As such, the fact that a recipient has been selected for an OIG audit is not necessarily indicative of\na suspected concern or problem area. 47 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What are the steps in an OIG audit?

Funds could be used more efficiently based on management actions such as reductions\nin outlays; deobligation of funds; withdrawal; costs not incurred by implementing recommended\nimprovements; and other identified savings. 48 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual\n\u2022 Questioned costs. Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted from a\nviolation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, award terms and conditions, or other\ndocument governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable and do not\nreflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because costs at the time\nof the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. \u2022 Policy and procedure. Weaknesses are identified in a recipient\u2019s accounting practices, fiscal stewardship,\naccuracy of data used in the development of the award applications, and/or inventory controls that led to the\nrecommendation cited in the audit. The recipient is required to develop or revise policies and/or procedures\nconsistent with their existing practices and submit to the COPS Office to forward to the OIG to close the\nrecommendation. After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Audit Liaison Section\nwill continue working as the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The\nCOPS Office will issue a closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must keep\nall documentation related to the audit for a period of three years following the audit\u2019s closure. 49 2019 COPS Office School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual VI. Reporting Requirements As an SVPP award recipient, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Programmatic Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report SVPP award\nfunding separately from all other funding sources, in order to ensure accurate financial and programmatic\nreporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have adequate financial internal controls in place\nto monitor the use of all funding, and also to ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms and conditions.",
