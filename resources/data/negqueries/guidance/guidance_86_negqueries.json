Samuels, Jr.\nDirector, Federal Bureau of Prisons\n1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n\u00a7 551.160 Purpose and scope. To advance towards becoming a clean air environment and to protect the health\nand safety of staff and inmates, the Bureau of Prisons will restrict areas and\ncircumstances where smoking is permitted within its institutions and offices. The Bureau recognizes the right to negotiate issues pertaining to this policy consistent with the\nMaster Agreement, statute, case law, and regulation. Medical and public health authorities have established the hazards of tobacco smoke. Of\nparticular concern are risks posed to nonsmokers by passive inhalation of environmental tobacco\nsmoke (ETS). The Surgeon General has long concluded that, as scientific research indicates,\nsecond-hand tobacco smoke is a cause of lung disease in otherwise healthy nonsmokers. On January 7, 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officially endorsed a report by\nan outside panel of scientific advisers to the agency, which stated that \u201cexposure to second-hand\ncigarette smoke causes lung cancer in adults and greatly increases the risk of respiratory illness\nin children.\u201d Federal Regulations from 28 CFR are shown in this type. Implementing instructions are shown in this type. The Bureau recognizes that when smokers quit, they may face physical discomfort, weight gain,\nand stress-related difficulties; however, these symptoms may be lessened with the appropriate\ninterventions of a smoking cessation program. According to the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, many who quit smoking relapse. Effective smoking cessation programs should\nprovide counseling and monitoring to enhance success. Since 2011 Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) has mandated that ALL FEHB plans offer 100% coverage to assist staff in\nquitting. a. Summary of Changes\nPolicy Rescinded\nP1640.04\nSmoking/No Smoking Areas (03/15/2004)\n\u25a0 On April 15, 2006, the BOP discontinued the sale and inmate use of both smoke and\nsmokeless tobacco products in institutions; therefore, inmate smoking cessation program was\namended to be available only to incoming inmates, not existing inmates. \u25a0 Staff smoking cessation program was removed based on the guidelines placed by the\nprevious program statement. b. Program Objectives. The expected results of this program are:\n\u25a0 The designation of smoking areas may reduce exposure to second-hand smoke. \u25a0 All Bureau facilities will be free of second-hand smoke, except staff residences, perimeter\npatrol vehicles, and towers when occupied by one person. \u25a0 Areas where smoking is permitted will be clearly identified. 2. DEFINITIONS\n\u00a7 551.161 Definitions. For the purposes of this subpart, smoking is defined as inhaling the smoke of any\nsubstance through the use of smoking apparatus including, but not limited to,\ncigars, cigarettes, or pipes. An area designated as free of second-hand smoke is defined as one in which there are no\nlighted tobacco products (e.g., cigars, cigarettes, pipes). Designated area is defined as a smoking area which the Warden has clearly identified. P1640.05 1/7/2015 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 2 3. STAFF SMOKING/NO SMOKING AREAS This section also applies to visitors, volunteers, and contractors. \u00a7 551.162 Smoking generally prohibited.",

Wardens must establish an institution Smoking Cessation\nProgram consistent with local resources for newly committed inmates within the first 90 days of\nincarceration. The institution A&O Booklet will inform inmates of a Smoking Cessation Program\u2019s\navailability, including application and participation procedures. A Smoking Cessation Program\nmust, at a minimum, address:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Nutrition. Physical activity (exercise). Stress management. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). Institutions conduct these activities through a combination of:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Videos. Classroom presentations. Recreation activities. The sale of nicotine replacement patches in the Commissary. Group or individual counseling. b. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). Nicotine replacement patches may assist with the\ngradual tapering of nicotine consumption. Each institution Commissary will stock or sell patches\nthrough the Special Purchase Order (SPO) process. Inmates may purchase patches with staff\napproval. An inmate requesting NRT must have an initial medical assessment to purchase a six to ten-week\nsupply of patches (see below). The inmate then obtains an initial written approval from a Bureau\nhealth care provider using the Nicotine Replacement Therapy Approval form (BP-A1019),\ncertifying that the inmate\u2019s health status has been reviewed and he or she is approved to use the\npatches. The health care provider will:\n\u25a0 Discuss the patch\u2019s proper use, describe possible side effects, and warn the inmate about\nproblems associated with overuse (such as the use of two or more patches at the same time,\nor the use of a patch and continued use of cigarettes).

The inmate takes the signed BP-A1019 to the Commissary, which allows him/her to purchase\ntwo weeks of NRT at a time. The Commissary staff member initials the BP-A1019 each time the\ninmate purchases NRT. The inmate keeps the BP-A1019 until the final supply of patches has\nbeen purchased. When the inmate completes the NRT (6 or 10 weeks), the Commissary staff member takes the\nBP-A1019 from the inmate and sends it to the Health Services Unit for inclusion in the Inmate\nHealth Record within 30 days of when the inmate should have made the last authorized purchase. 6. INSTITUTION SUPPLEMENT Each institution must develop an Institution Supplement containing information on smoking\nrestrictions, and identifying any authorized outdoor smoking areas within the institution. The Warden forwards a copy of the Institution Supplement to the Regional Health Systems\nAdministrator for review and approval.
