P5300.22 11/07/2016 2 Volunteers whose services are discontinued may not be considered for future volunteer service at\nany BOP location. The Records subsection explains record maintenance for Level I and II volunteers. Attachment\nA defines the content of an Official Volunteer File. Multi-Institution Volunteers. Volunteers are required to attend initial and refresher training at\nonly one institution. The correctional services component of volunteer training covers all\nsecurity levels. Prior to volunteers beginning service at subsequent facilities, the program\nmanager must provide an institution-specific orientation to augment initial or refresher training. Ex-Offenders. For the purposes of this Program Statement, ex-offenders are defined as former\ninmates who have completed their term of supervision, if applicable. Before providing volunteer\nservices, the ex-offender must have a documented period of at least three years of crime-free\nconduct after release. The RAC will also check with the Special Investigative Supervisor/Agent\n(SIS/SIA) to ensure there are no STG assignments or concerns. Security, Badging, and Sign-In Procedures (formerly Institution Security). Level I\nVolunteers enter the institution via a memo signed by the Warden or designee that is coordinated\nby the program manager. Copies are provided to the Control Center, Front Lobby Officer, and\nother designated areas, as well as to the RAC. The program manager monitors the number of\nvisits to ensure it does not exceed Level I requirements. For Level II visitation volunteers, a memo signed by the Warden or designee is distributed to the\nControl Center, Front Lobby, and other designated areas by the program manager to identify\ninmates being visited. A Moderate Background Investigation (MBI) clearance is required for volunteers with\nunescorted badges. The national automated volunteer system is used to create and number volunteer badges. A\nroster is generated by the RAC quarterly or as changes occur from the automated volunteer\nsystem to account for and control badges. The roster is provided to Correctional Services for\naccountability. Excess pink and blue badge paper is accounted for to ensure compliance with the\nProgram Statement Correctional Services Manual. Two badges are created for each volunteer. One may not be removed from the designated\nCorrectional Services area. The other will be worn in an easily visible place while the volunteer\nis in the institution. The front side has the volunteer\u2019s picture, first initial and last name,\ndepartment to be visited, date of expiration, and authorized signature. The reverse side has the P5300.22 11/07/2016 3 volunteer\u2019s first and last name, institution and department to be visited, issue date, expiration\ndate, and authorized department/areas. Procedures for laminating and embossing badges now adhere to the Correctional Services\nManual. Badges are removed from designated areas when volunteers become inactive, are\npending service discontinuation, or whose services are discontinued. Training. Defines training for RACs, MCs (Mentor Coordinators), RAAs, and volunteers. Within the first year RACs and RAAs receive at least 20 hours of initial standardized training\ndeveloped nationally. MCs receive 8 hours of standardized training developed nationally. RAAs ensure training is provided to the RACs. The NRB ensures training is provided to RAAs.",

      "content": "\u25a0 Volunteers will be recognized for their contributions and accomplishments. 2. DEFINITIONS\na. Volunteers. For the purposes of this Program Statement, volunteers are private citizens who\nprovide a variety of gratuitous services to the Bureau of Prisons. Gratuitous services are\nuncompensated services that would otherwise not be performed by a paid Government worker. Per 31 U.S.C. Section 1342, the Federal Government is not permitted to accept voluntary P5300.22 11/07/2016 5 services that are not pursuant to a prior contract or under an advance agreement that they will be\ngratuitous. The gratuitous services agreement under which the services are performed must\nstate, among other things, that the volunteers waive all claims to financial reimbursement or\ncompensation from the Bureau for their services, time, or expenses. The gratuitous service\nagreement should be entered into before the services are provided. Volunteers are ordinarily any adult 18 years of age or older (except at high security and\nadministrative institutions where volunteers must be at least 21 years of age). Volunteers cannot serve as both a volunteer and contractor in the Bureau. Bureau staff may not serve as volunteers at any facility housing Bureau inmates except in limited\ncircumstances not involving one-on-one contact with inmates (e.g., choirs). These activities\nmust be approved by the Warden (Bureau institutions) or branch administrator (contract\nfacilities). b. Non-Volunteers \u2212 Government Providers. A number of Federal, state, and local\ngovernment agencies provide services to inmates that are part of these agencies\u2019 duties; for\nexample, the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of\nLabor, state workforce departments, etc. These providers are not considered volunteers. Non-Federal providers or Federal providers without Federal Government credentials must\ncomplete an NCIC Check (BP-A0660). The Warden approves their entry into the institution via\nmemo for each entrance into the institution, which is kept on file with the NCIC by the program\nmanager for a period of three years. 3. CLASSIFICATION\na. Level I Volunteers. Authorized to perform a service four days or less per year for an\ninstitution or administrative office. These volunteers will receive general training; however, they\nare not badged. b. Level II Volunteers. Authorized to perform a service more than four days per year for an\ninstitution or administrative office. These volunteers receive a badge and are required to attend\nvolunteer and/or mentor training. 4. TYPES OF VOLUNTEERS Volunteers can be specifically approved to provide several different types of services, such as\nmentoring, visitation, and assistance with transitional needs or resources, as well as programs or P5300.22 11/07/2016 6 activities associated with the needs of a specific department. However, the BOP prohibits the\nuse of volunteers to deliver health care. The delivery of health care is defined as the clinical\nassessment, diagnosis, treatment, and education of inmates regarding their medical, dental,\nmental health, or nursing treatment plan. Institutions may use volunteers to present health\npromotion/disease prevention educational sessions or nationally standardized self-help programs\n(e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous) if the institution\u2019s sponsoring department determines the volunteer\nhas the requisite health education training and experience, and the educational materials are\nreviewed for accurate and ethical content.",

If volunteers are used to present health education\nsessions, local procedures must be developed for selection, training, staff supervision, facility\norientation, and a definition of tasks, responsibilities, and authority that is approved by the health\nauthority (Health Services Administrator or Chief Psychologist). All volunteers need to be specifically approved for the type of service they are performing as\noutlined below. For each type of service being performed they are required to be supervised by\nan appropriately specified department head or program manager. Therefore, a volunteer may\nreceive supervision/program management by more than one staff member if engaged in several\ntypes of volunteer services. a. Program. Volunteers may provide structured activities, seminars, workshops, and classes\nthat support institutional programs and needs; for example, volunteers providing religious\nservices to authorized faith groups. They are under the direction of a program manager. The\nprogram manager determines the instructional schedule of the volunteer and identifies the\ninmates who participate in the program/activity. b. Administrative. Volunteers who provide support to the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Central and\nRegional Offices.\nc. Transitional. Volunteers must be processed as Level II. They may be engaged to\nconcentrate on services and resources inmates will need in preparation for and during their\ntransition back to the community. These volunteers may work with inmates and their families on\npost-release planning services such as transportation, housing assistance, employment, benefits,\nfaith-based support, and other reentry-related needs. They must document any external contacts\nusing the Transitional/Mentor Volunteer Contact Form (BP-A1068). Volunteers may work with\nmultiple inmates. d. Mentoring. Volunteers must be processed as Level II. They concentrate on personal\ndevelopment of individual inmates. This usually occurs one-on-one; however, due to the\ngeographic isolation of some facilities, the availability of mentors is limited. If a sufficient\nnumber of mentors is not available for one-on-one mentoring, one mentor may provide\nmentorship to a group of inmates with the program manager\u2019s and Warden\u2019s approval. Mentor\nrelationships ordinarily begin while an inmate is incarcerated and continue following release. P5300.22 11/07/2016 7 Sessions for mentors and assigned inmates are scheduled in conjunction with the program\nmanager and in a manner that does not conflict with authorized visiting procedures. Days, times,\nand locations of mentoring sessions are at the Warden\u2019s discretion, as appropriate for the\ninstitution\u2019s security level. e. Visitation. Volunteers providing visitation services meet one-on-one with inmates in the\nvisiting room during normal visiting hours. Visits will be supervised by the Visiting Room staff. The RAC serves as program manager for visitation volunteers. Approved visitation volunteers are provided a pen or pencil and blank paper upon request for\ntaking notes, unless the Warden has established local procedures prohibiting this practice. The\nprogram manager coordinates the availability of these items. Visitation volunteers are\nauthorized to visit specific inmates who have been pre-arranged prior to their visit (at least two\nweeks in advance).",

COMMUNICATIONS AMONG VOLUNTEERS, INMATES, FORMER INMATES,\nEX-OFFENDERS, AND INMATE FAMILIES Only mentoring and transitional volunteers who are approved to communicate with inmates,\nformer inmates, ex-offenders, and inmate families (as defined for Bureau visiting purposes) may\nhave program-related contact regarding the inmates to whom they have been assigned. They\nmay also have program-related contact regarding the inmate\u2019s personal or spiritual growth,\npreparation for release, and through the transition process for reintegration in the community. Program-related contacts include liaison with local organizations that have the potential to\nprovide assistance. Contacts must be professional in nature \u2013 that is, activities related to a specific program area or\nthat provide specific reentry assistance, which:\n\u25a0 Assist with specific program content or reentry needs identified through the inmate\u2019s\nassessment. \u25a0 Coordinate resources related to a program or reentry need. \u25a0 Obtain information from or coordinate with an inmate or family member related to program\ncontent or reentry need. Volunteers may use appropriate materials, which are subject to Front Entrance procedures and\napproved in advance by the program manager before distribution to a specific inmate or the\ninmate population. Inmates can also bring program-related supplies and materials to a mentoring P5300.22 11/07/2016 8 or reentry/transitional planning session with prior review by and approval of the program\nmanager. a. Methods of Contact. The Volunteer shall make a written request for approval of telephone\ncalls and correspondence communication with an inmate through the program manager. The\nprogram manager will submit the request to the SIS department for approval. The program\nmanager will notify the volunteer if the communication is approved/disapproved. However, if\nthe volunteer fails to request approval of communication with an inmate, his/her services can be\ndiscontinued. Approved types of contact include telephone, email, regular mail, and other\nidentified electronic communications. Three-way calls are prohibited. Mail, publications, and\nenclosures must comply with the Program Statements Correspondence and Incoming\nPublications. Program managers may arrange video teleconferencing (if available) to facilitate\nneeded contact between the inmate and volunteer. b. Contact Monitoring. Phone calls and correspondence within the institution are subject to\nmonitoring and other agency screening procedures. Certain categories of inmates receive\nenhanced monitoring. All telephone, electronic, and written communication between an\nincarcerated inmate or family member and a volunteer must be documented using the\nTransitional/Mentor Volunteer Contact Form, BP-A1068, provided by the program manager to\nthe volunteer. In-person contact with family members and volunteers must also be documented\non this form. These forms are submitted by the volunteers to the program managers at least\nmonthly, or as otherwise determined by the program manager. The program manager maintains\nthese forms for a period of five years. A Release of Information Consent (BP-A0192) must be\nsigned by the inmate before any family/community contact and placed in the program manager\u2019s\nfile.",

Recruitment. Technical assistance. Training. c. Reentry Affairs Coordinators (RACs). The RACs manage volunteer services at the\ninstitution, including local recruitment, clearance and security compliance, training, file\nmanagement, and recognition of volunteers. The RAC works with program managers and the Affirmative Employment Committee to recruit\nvolunteers who meet the needs of the inmate population. The RACs are supervised by a\ndesignated Associate Warden and will be notified at the time of position acceptance and when\nsupervision changes occur. d. Mentor Coordinators (MCs). MCs work with the RAC, mentor program managers,\nchaplains, and other pertinent staff to develop resources to fulfill inmate mentoring services. e. Program Managers.

Assistance from a\nprogram manager may be necessary when a volunteer needs to complete forms. 7. RECRUITMENT The RAC and department heads, in conjunction with the Affirmative Employment Committee,\nwill develop a formal strategy and volunteer plan in accordance with a nationally standardized\nformat to recruit a volunteer workforce that meets the needs of the institution and inmate\npopulation. a. Recruitment Areas. Volunteers are normally recruited from the vicinity of the institution. RACs/MCs and department heads will maintain contact with individuals from the community,\ncolleges and universities, public service, and religious organizations having an interest in\nvolunteerism, as well as the public at large. The Community Relations Board (CRB) is also an excellent resource for institution programs\nand initiatives. The RAC will advise the CRB of specific volunteer needs in the institution and\nnotify staff of volunteer opportunities within the community. b. RAC/MC Work Hours for Volunteer Activities. Community outreach, volunteer\nrecruitment, and other related activities may occur outside normal working hours to promote\neffective recruitment strategies, attend collaborative events, participate in community-based\nnetworking events, and other related activities. The RAC and MC\u2019s work hours may be adjusted\nby request of the RAC/MC or supervisor in accordance with the Master Agreement. For\nexample, if an event is on Saturday, with the supervisor\u2019s advanced approval, the RAC/MC may\nsplit work hours between Saturday and an alternate day during that administrative work week. P5300.22 11/07/2016 13 8. BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS AND FILE MANAGEMENT\na. Background Investigations. A background investigation will be conducted on all volunteers\nas outlined in the chart below. The RAC or program manager, as applicable per the Distribution\nof Duties Chart, ensures background investigation requirements are completed for each volunteer\nprior to serving as a Level I or Level II volunteer. Level II volunteer candidates may attend\nvolunteer training prior to completion of the background investigation. If a volunteer is serving at one or more institutions, training only has to be completed yearly at\none facility. When a volunteer serves at more than one facility, it is the responsibility of all the\nserviced institutions to ensure the volunteer\u2019s information is uploaded in the national automated\nvolunteer system, training requirements are met, and each institution maintains copies of all\nnecessary OVF forms, except at complexes where one centralized copy will be maintained. The Warden determines the suitability of non-citizens to serve as volunteers. Non-citizens who\nare approved as volunteers are subject to all background investigation requirements for the level\nof service to be provided.",

Background investigations are ordinarily completed within 45 days from the date\nthe application is received. If this timeframe cannot be met, the RAC documents the reason in\nthe OVF. If clearance is not obtained within six months, the RAC provides a report to the RAA\nfor further resolution. However, badges may not be issued to Level II volunteers until all\nclearances are obtained. While a volunteer is waiting for background clearance approval as a\nLevel II volunteer, he/she may serve as a Level I volunteer in accordance with Level I\nrequirements. However, visitation volunteers will not be limited to four visits per year while\npending background clearance, as long as other requirements are met; e.g., training. All Level II volunteer applicants will be given two opportunities to obtain fingerprint clearance. After two negative responses are received from the Civil Applicant System (CAS) due to\nunreadable prints, a Name Check is conducted following standardized national procedures for\neither U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens. These procedures are available on the Reentry\nSallyport page. If the fingerprint or Name Check reveals previous criminal activity that would P5300.22 11/07/2016 15 compromise institution security as determined by the Warden, the volunteer application for a\nLevel II status will be denied. The volunteer may be granted Level I status by the Warden.\nb. National Automated Volunteer System. The national automated volunteer system allows\nusers at institutions, regional offices, and the Central Office to enter demographic and other key\ninformation regarding Level I and II volunteers. Requests for access to the system are made\nthrough the RAA, who submits a help desk ticket. RACs are responsible for entering active, inactive, and service discontinued for Level II\nvolunteers, as outlined in the system manual. A copy of the Training Manual can be accessed\nvia Sallyport. c. Processing of Volunteers.

For volunteers in inactive status,\nthe file is maintained for three years past the date placed in inactive status and then destroyed. 9. MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL VOLUNTEERS Individuals may serve as volunteers in more than one institution. Background investigative\ninformation for multi-institutional volunteers is shared with all facilities desiring to use the\nvolunteer. All investigation components must be completed before the volunteer may serve, including a\ncross-reference with the national automated volunteer system to ensure he/she has not been\ndiscontinued or is pending discontinuation from service at another location. An OVF is maintained at all institutions or centralized at a complex using the volunteer\u2019s\nservices. The volunteer is required to attend initial and refresher training at only one institution. The\ncorrectional services\u2019 component of volunteer training will cover all security levels. Prior to a\nvolunteer beginning service at subsequent facilities, the program manager is required to provide\nan institution-specific orientation to augment the initial or refresher training. Training documentation for all sessions is shared with the other institution(s) for which the\nvolunteer provides services. 10. EX-OFFENDERS Programs can often be enriched by the contributions of ex-offenders who share their experiences\nand personal progress. Wardens may approve ex-offenders convicted of felony offenses in any\njurisdiction to serve as volunteers. In addition to meeting the requirements for training and background investigations, the RAC will\nensure the following are completed before an ex-offender may be approved to serve as a\nvolunteer:\n\u25a0 Documented period of at least three years of crime-free conduct after release and has\ncompleted any term of supervision, if applicable. \u25a0 Check to ensure the ex-offender has no separatees within the institution.",

Exoffenders must not be granted waivers for unescorted status or passes. 11. SECURITY, BADGING, AND SIGN-IN PROCEDURES\na. Sign-In Procedures. Level I volunteers are approved to enter the institution via a memo\nsigned by the Warden or designee, coordinated by the program manager. Approval shall not be\ngranted until the background clearance requirements for volunteer services are met. Copies\nshould be provided to the Control Center, Front Lobby Officer, and other designated areas, as\nwell as the RAC. The program manager monitors the number of visits to ensure they do not\nexceed Level I requirements. For Level II visitation volunteers, a memo signed by the Warden or designee is generated and\ndistributed to the Control Center, Front Lobby, and other designated areas by the program\nmanager to identify the inmates being visited. b. Badges. For Level II volunteers, the RAC uses the national automated volunteer system for\ncreating and numbering volunteer badges. A roster is generated from the system by the RAC\nquarterly or as changes occur to account for and control volunteer badges. The rosters should be\nprovided to correctional services for distribution. Excess pink and blue badge paper is accounted for using a bin card system. Each fiscal year, the\ntotal amount of each color of blank badge paper is accounted for and written on the bin card\n(separate cards for each color). Each time a sheet of badge paper is used, it is deducted from the\nbin card. The blank badge paper and bin cards are maintained in a secure file cabinet. Two badges with photos are created for each volunteer. Both are maintained in an area\ndesignated by Correctional Services. One is completed on both sides and always remains in the\ndesignated area. The second volunteer badge is worn in an easily visible place by the volunteer at all times while\nin the institution. The front of the badge has a photo of the volunteer and the following\ninformation:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Volunteer\u2019s first initial and last name. Department/area to be visited.

Prior to the discontinuation of a volunteer\u2019s services for any reason,\nthe RAC, along with the program manager and Associate Warden, consults with the Warden and\nRAA. If the discontinuation of services is deemed appropriate, these procedures are followed:\n\u25a0 The RAC generates a letter to notify the volunteer of the reason(s) for the discontinuation of\nservices, state that entrance is no longer permitted into any institution, and include appeal\nprocedures.\n\u25a0 If the volunteer is providing services at other locations, these institutions are documented in\nthe letter and respective Wardens notified to ensure the volunteer is removed from their\nlocations. \u25a0 The RAC removes the volunteer\u2019s badges from the designated areas. They are maintained in\nthe OVF until the appeal process is completed. \u25a0 The RAC updates the volunteer\u2019s status in the national automated volunteer system to\n\u201cpending discontinuation.\u201d Notes regarding the incident are detailed in the system. Volunteers have 30 days from the receipt of the service discontinuation letter to appeal in writing\nto the Warden. The final determination of a volunteer\u2019s discontinuation of services will\nordinarily be rendered within 90 days of the receipt of the appeal. Once a final determination has been made, the RAC updates the volunteer\u2019s status in the national\nautomated volunteer system as outlined below. The reason for the volunteer\u2019s status change is\ndocumented in the system:\n\u25a0 If services are discontinued, the status is changed from \u201cpending discontinuation\u201d to\n\u201cdiscontinued\u201d and the badges are destroyed. \u25a0 If reinstated, the status is changed from \u201cpending discontinuation\u201d to \u201cactive.\u201d If an appeal is not received from the volunteer within the 30-day timeframe, the RAC updates the\nvolunteer\u2019s status in the national automated volunteer system to \u201cdiscontinued\u201d and documents\nthe reason in the system. Badges are also destroyed. Volunteers whose services have been discontinued from any BOP institution or facility may not\nbe approved or reinstated for service at any BOP location. P5300.22 11/07/2016 22 b. Regional/Central Office Procedures. Prior to the discontinuation of a volunteer\u2019s services\nfor any reason, the program manager consults with the Regional Reentry Administrator (RAA)\nand Regional Director (RD) or National Reentry Affairs Branch (NRB) Administrator and\nAssistant Director (AD). For the regional offices, the RAA generates a letter notifying the\nvolunteer of the reason(s) for the discontinuation of services. The letter should state that\nentrance is no longer permitted into any Bureau facility, and include appeal procedures. For the Central Office, the NRB generates a letter notifying the volunteer of the reason(s) for the\ndiscontinuation of services. The volunteer may appeal discontinuation of services in writing to\nthe Deputy Regional Director or Deputy Assistant Director of the appropriate division within 30\ndays of receipt of the notice of discontinuation of services.",
