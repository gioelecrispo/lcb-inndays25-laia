Should local facilities make any changes outside the\nrequired changes in the national policy or establish any local procedures to implement the national\npolicy, the local Union may invoke to negotiate procedures or appropriate arrangements. 2. STRUCTURE OF PSYCHOLOGY SERVICES\na. Mission Statement. Psychology Services Departments actively support the Bureau\u2019s mission\nby contributing to the operation of safe, humane, cost-effective, and appropriately secure facilities\nand by providing reentry programming to reduce recidivism and facilitate offenders\u2019 successful\nreturn to the community. Specifically, the mission of Psychology Services is to provide three key\nservices in the Bureau:\n\u25a0 Mental Health Care. Psychology Services Departments provide mental health care for\ninmates, which include the assessment and treatment of a wide range of mental disorders. The\nmental health care provided to the inmates is consistent with professional standards and best\npractices in correctional psychology. \u25a0 Reentry Services. Psychology Services Departments offer evidence-based, cognitivebehavioral programming to address risk factors associated with criminal conduct; i.e.,\ncriminogenic needs. This programming facilitates successful reentry by reducing an offender\u2019s\nlikelihood of recidivism. \u25a0 Behavioral Scientist Expertise. Behavioral science is the systematic analysis and\ninvestigation of human behavior; psychologists are trained behavioral scientists. By sharing\ntheir understanding of human behavior, psychologists play a significant role in the orderly\noperation of Bureau facilities. Psychologists share their expertise during formal training events\nand informal, routine consultations with staff. b. Model of Service Delivery. The Psychology Services Department is organized as a separate,\ncentralized department within the institution or complex with adequate privacy, space, and\nresources to meet the institution\u2019s need for psychological services as described above. The offices\nof residential Psychology Treatment Program (PTP) staff should be located within the respective\nunit. In addition, grouping of staff offices is appropriate when such grouping is done in accordance\nwith the special Psychology Services missions of an institution. P5310.17 8/25/2016 3 The Bureau has chosen cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as a theoretical model to guide\npsychological service delivery because of its proven effectiveness with inmate populations. CBT\nis a broad term and includes a variety of cognitive-behaviorally based treatment protocols utilized\nin the Bureau, to include Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Dialectical Behavior\nTherapy (DBT). Empirical support for CBT\u2019s effectiveness is noted both in the treatment of\nmental disorders and criminal thinking patterns. Therefore, CBT is utilized to address two\ncomponents of the Psychology Services mission \u2013 mental health care and reentry services. CBT\nemphasizes the learning and practice of skills associated with improved mental health and\nadaptive, pro-social behavior.",

CBT\nemphasizes the learning and practice of skills associated with improved mental health and\nadaptive, pro-social behavior. Therefore, inmates who participate in CBT and related interventions\nare better able to achieve goals the Bureau has for all inmates, including responsibility, selfawareness, and independence. Specific to reentry services, the Bureau has also organized services under a Risk-Need-Responsivity\nmodel. Here, treatment resources are directed toward inmates who are at the highest risk of reoffense based on validated assessment procedures. Treatment protocols are selected or designed\nto address risk factors for criminal reoffending. These include but are not limited to those identified with substance use disorders; sex offenders;\nand those with offense supportive attitudes and beliefs; i.e., criminal thinking patterns. Interventions are delivered in a manner that is responsive to each inmate\u2019s unique treatment needs,\nto include learning style and level of motivation. The Bureau\u2019s core value of correctional excellence underlies the service delivery model for\nbehavioral scientist expertise. Psychology Services staff are \u201ccorrectional workers first\u201d and in\nthis context they are uniquely situated to offer their perspective on understanding human behavior. As fellow correctional workers, psychologists work alongside their Bureau peers, offering their\nexpertise through both formal training events and informal staff consultation. The presence of\nPsychology Services in the institution also increases the likelihood Bureau staff will feel\ncomfortable utilizing Employee Assistance Program and/or Crisis Support Team services. c. Priorities for Delivery of Psychological Services. The following list of priorities describes\nthe professional duties and responsibilities of a Psychology Services Department. The Chief\nPsychologist is responsible for ensuring the department adheres to the priorities and for ensuring a\nfair and equitable distribution of the workload associated with meeting these priorities.

The Chief Psychologist, with\nthe Warden\u2019s approval, may delegate Cost Center Manager authority to a Program Coordinator. (1) Operating Funds. The Branch is responsible for submitting annual budget requests for PTPs\nand other specialty program funding, to include funding for practicum and psychology pre-doctoral\ninternship programs, forensic evaluation programs, SMU programs, CARE3-MH sites. Typically,\nfunding is provided based upon standardized formulas developed within the Branch. Branch\napproval is required to reprogram these funds. Drug abuse programs, sex offender programs, and inmate trust funds are mandated for specific\nprogram areas and are used only to fund activities related to these programs. Use of these funds\nfor other programs or to offset deficits in other cost centers is not permitted.",

Funds for\nsex offender programs are provided within the general Psychology Services budget. P5310.17 8/25/2016 11 (2) Tangible Incentives in PTPs. Tangible incentives are funded by the Trust Fund. Monetary\nprogram completion awards as outlined in applicable policies (i.e., Psychology Treatment\nPrograms and Treatment and Care of Inmates with Mental Illness) are deposited to the\ninmate\u2019s commissary account. Monetary awards should only be given in conjunction with a\nparticipant\u2019s successful completion of PTP phases or goals defined in their treatment plans. Tangible incentives such as t-shirts, sweatshirts, food items (e.g., snacks, popcorn, drinks) or mugs\nwith the program logo may be appropriate. The selection of tangible incentives to be offered at the\ninstitution is at the Warden\u2019s discretion. Tangible incentives are provided as special recognition\nfor participants who demonstrate behaviors reflecting the attitudes of change, a commitment to\ntreatment, conformity with program norms, progress on treatment plan goals, and behaviors that\nare expected in the general society. Behaviors which merit tangible incentives are clearly\ndocumented in PDS. These incentives are separate from the monetary awards for phase\ncompletion. (3) Positions. Branch approval is also required for the reprogramming of any Psychology Services\npositions. Authorized positions in drug treatment cost centers are funded at 100%, due to ongoing\ngovernment-wide initiatives related to drug abuse treatment. Salary savings generated by leaving a\ndrug treatment position vacant cannot be utilized for other institution requirements. (4) Staff Training. National training project codes have been established to fund all Psychology\nServices training. The Branch submits annual requests for national training funds and disperses\nthese funds in a manner consistent with the Psychology Services mission; i.e., training focused on\nrelevant clinical populations and evidence-based practices. Psychology Services operating funds\nare not to be utilized to fund staff training. 4. PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES FOR INMATES The delivery of psychological services in the Bureau is guided by the American Psychological\nAssociation\u2019s (APA\u2019s) Ethical Principles for Psychologists and Code of Conduct, as well as the\nAPA\u2019s guidelines for the professional practice of psychology. Psychologists are responsible for the\nassessment and treatment of mental disorders in the inmate population. Utilizing their clinical\nexpertise, psychologists identify inmates in need of mental health care and determine the type of\npsychological services to be provided. Health Services staff perform similar functions with respect\nto psychiatric mental health care. Mental health providers in Psychology Services make the final\ndetermination regarding who will receive psychological care, and the nature of the care they will\nreceive.

To this\nend, the Branch designates certain Evidence-Based Practices (EBPs) as Priority Practices. Priority\nPractices are:\n\u25a0 EBPs.\n\u25a0 Interventions addressing core mental health and/or reentry needs of the inmate population. \u25a0 Services for inmates with the greatest need for mental health intervention and/or the greatest\nrisk of recidivism. \u25a0 Cost effective interventions selected and supported by the Branch as preferred service\nmodalities for the agency. The Branch places information regarding Priority Practices for each type of institution on\nSallyport. Chief Psychologists are responsible for selecting interventions from the Priority\nPractices list consistent with their institution\u2019s security level, care level, and mission. Ordinarily,\nPsychology Services Departments are actively engaged in the provision of Priority Practices as an\nessential function. Priority Practices are offered before other types of programming groups. Inmate Orientation to Psychology Services. Each institution is responsible for providing newly\narriving inmates with information about available psychological services \u2013 both locally and at\nother Bureau institutions as applicable. This information is presented to inmates during the\ninstitution\u2019s Admission and Orientation (A&O) Program and in the A&O Handbook. In addition,\ninmates may be provided with additional information at the time of their psychological intake and\nvia postings on bulletin boards and/or TRULINCS. The Chief Psychologist ensures the Psychology Services A&O Lesson Plan and Psychology\nServices section of the A&O Handbook describe the services provided by the department and the\nprocedures for inmate access to Psychology Services. Each institution will use the standardized\nA&O Lesson Plan available on Sallyport, with the necessary institution-specific information\ninserted. The Psychology A&O Lesson Plan must include, at a minimum, information on drug\ntreatment programs, mental health programs, sex offender programs, suicide prevention, privacy\nand confidentiality, and local procedures for obtaining psychological services. The Psychology\nServices A&O Lesson Plan is presented by a psychologist. During the A&O presentation, the\npsychologist makes every effort to present the material in a manner which will motivate inmates\nwith a need for services to pursue and engage in treatment. Inmate requests for services are responded to immediately for crisis situations or potential suicide\nrisk, and ordinarily within three (3) working days for routine requests. Responses for routine\nrequests may include an appointment, an invitation to the department\u2019s open house hours,\nplacement on a waiting list for the desired services, clarification, or redirection.

For inmates in holdover\nstatus, no further evaluation is required, unless significant mental health or PREA-related concerns\nare noted. Inmates with a Psychology Alert assignment are also promptly evaluated by a psychologist,\nconsistent with procedures outlined in the SENTRY Psychology Alert Function Program\nStatement.

Psychology Services intake screening procedures for non-holdover inmates are detailed below:\n(1) Pretrial or Pre-Sentence Detainees in MCCs, MDCs, FDCs, FTCs, or Jails. The\nPsychology Services intake screening process for pretrial or pre-sentence detainees in pretrial\nstatus, in MCCs, MDCs, FDCs, FTCs, or Jail Units, provides for screening for mental health\nproblems. Within 24 hours of an inmate\u2019s arrival, he/she completes the BP-A0519 Psychology\nServices Inmate Questionnaire (PSIQ). Upon completion, institution staff (e.g., Receiving and\nDischarge, Health Services) review the PSIQ and immediately alert Psychology Services if the\ninmate reports he/she is thinking of harming or killing him-/herself. If the review is conducted\noutside normal business hours, the on-call psychologist is contacted by telephone. If an inmate\nreports he/she is thinking of harming or killing him/herself, a psychologist conducts a Suicide Risk\nAssessment, as described in the Program Statement Suicide Prevention Program. Ordinarily, completed PSIQs for all other inmates are reviewed by a psychologist within one\nworking day. Inmates who report current symptoms are scheduled for further evaluation and triage\nin a timely manner. This evaluation is documented in PDS, typically as an Initial Intake\nEvaluation note. All other inmate contacts are documented as appropriate. Each Chief Psychologist is responsible for working with the Case Management Coordinator\n(CMC) to ensure procedures are in place to obtain adequate historical psychological information\nfor state boarders and pretrial offenders, ideally in advance of the inmate\u2019s arrival.

Findings from\nthese screenings are documented in PDS using the applicable Risk of Sexual Victimization or Risk\nof Sexual Abusiveness note and relayed to appropriate staff (e.g., via SENTRY, TRUSCOPE). c. Psychological Review of Inmates in Restrictive Housing. A psychologist reviews the\npsychological status of any inmate confined in a SHU, SMU, ADX, or any other similar housing\nfor more than 30 consecutive calendar days. An initial psychological review is conducted on or\nbefore the 30th calendar day of consecutive confinement in restrictive housing. Following this\ninitial review, subsequent reviews occur approximately monthly, but not more than 35 calendar\ndays after the preceding review. Psychological reviews of inmates in restrictive housing rely on data from multiple sources; e.g.,\ncontact with the inmate; input from Correctional Officers working in the unit; information shared\nduring restrictive housing meetings; and relevant documentation contained in PDS. The results of the psychological review are documented in PDS using the appropriate note; i.e.,\nADX Review, SHU Review, SMU Contact. With implementation of the SHU Program, copies of\nSHU Reviews are no longer submitted to the Segregation Reviewing Official or to the inmate\u2019s\nCentral File. Any concerns related to threat to self, threat to others, and adjustment to restrictive\nhousing are summarized in the note. In addition, clinically relevant observations and findings\nspecific to mental health status are required if the inmate meets any of the following criteria:\n\u25a0 A mental health care level assignment of CARE2-MH or above. \u25a0 A PSYCH ALERT assignment. \u25a0 A Suicide Risk Assessment in the previous six months.

Review of Inmates with a Psychology Alert (PSY ALERT) Assignment. The PSY ALERT\nassignment is applied to inmates with substantial mental health concerns that require extra care\nwhen their housing is changed or they are transferred. Generally, the PSY ALERT assignment is to\nbe applied in special mental health cases that will likely pose management and security concerns\nfor the institution when an inmate\u2019s housing is changed or when a transfer occurs. The guiding\nprinciple of the PSY ALERT assignment is continuity of care. Inmates with a PSY ALERT\nassignment are reviewed by a psychologist upon arrival. Inmates with a PSY ALERT assignment\nmust always have a face to face interview with a psychologist before releasing to general\npopulation. Placement in SHU in lieu of general population is not an acceptable alternative to a\nface to face interview with a psychologist. If an inmate with a PSY ALERT assignment arrives at\nthe institution during a time period when no psychologist is scheduled to be on duty, the face to\nface interview is conducted by the Mental Health Duty Officer. In addition, inmates with a PSY ALERT assignment are reviewed by a psychologist when under\nconsideration for a transfer and when placed in restrictive housing. To ensure this review occurs,\napplicable inmates receive a PSY ALERT assignment in SENTRY, as described in the Program\nStatement SENTRY Psychology Alert Function. Enhanced psychological review procedures for\ninmates with a PSY ALERT assignment are detailed in the above Program Statement, as well as\ngeneral guidelines for placing an inmate in PSY ALERT status. e. Psychological Evaluations. Psychological evaluations are clinical assessments based on a\nclinical interview, behavioral observations, psychological testing, and/or review of collateral\ndocumentation, in which the psychologist reaches a conclusion based upon their clinical expertise. Psychological evaluations must be completed as mandated in policy. Examples of policy-mandated psychological evaluations are the Initial Intake Evaluation, courtordered forensic evaluations, and mental health evaluations conducted in conjunction with an ADX\nReferral. In addition, psychological evaluations may be performed at a clinician\u2019s discretion,\ngenerally to help formulate a diagnosis and/or treatment plan. Inmates may decline to participate in a clinical interview or complete psychological testing\nassociated with a psychological evaluation. However, an evaluation may still be completed relying\non behavioral observations and a review of available documentation. The following Psychology\nServices Program Statements detail procedures for specific types of psychological evaluations: P5310.17 8/25/2016 18 \u25a0 Forensic and Other Mental Health Evaluations: Procedures for court-ordered pretrial and\npost-trial forensic evaluations, Witness Security Program forensic evaluations, and evaluations\nfor disciplinary purposes.",

In addition to the above psychological evaluations, psychologists may also assist with GED\naccommodation requests by administering, scoring, and interpreting an intellectual assessment\ninstrument; e.g., Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and rendering a diagnosis when appropriate. These evaluations are conducted at the request of the Education Department, with a psychologist or\npre-doctoral psychology intern responsible for conducting the intellectual assessment and\nEducation staff responsible for conducting the achievement assessment. 6. PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR INMATES\na. Outpatient (Nonresidential) Mental Health Treatment. Inmates with a need for mental\nhealth services may be offered group and/or individual mental health treatment. Typically, inmates\nreceiving these services have an identified need for treatment, a current mental health diagnosis,\nand a treatment plan supporting individual and/or group treatment. However, inmates presenting\nwith mild adjustment issues, or other short-term stressors, may participate in brief, individual\ncounseling sessions which do not require a current mental health diagnosis or a treatment plan. These brief counseling sessions are documented in PDS as Clinical Contacts. Under the supervision of the Chief Psychologist, the decision to engage an inmate in individual\nand/or group mental health treatment is based on clinician\u2019s professional judgment , contingent\nupon such factors as:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 The type of psychological problem(s) diagnosed. Limits of professional expertise. The inmate\u2019s motivation to participate in treatment. Departmental staffing level. Departmental priorities. Individual treatment; i.e., individual therapy, while a resource-intensive intervention, is more\nappropriate for some inmates. The decision to offer individual therapy as opposed to group\ntreatment may be based on several factors, such as the inmate\u2019s current diagnosis, presentation,\nP5310.17 8/25/2016 19 housing assignment, and interpersonal skills, as well as other factors; e.g., security concerns,\nresource limitations. Individual therapy services are documented in PDS using the Individual\nTherapy note, in conjunction with a current Diagnostic and Care Level Formulation and a\nTreatment Plan. Group treatment has proven to be both a clinically effective and efficient use of resources in the\ntreatment of inmates with substance use disorders, mental illnesses, or behavioral problems. Group treatments have the benefit of pro-social modeling (i.e., social learning) by the facilitator\nand other participants, building social support, and allowing the immediate practice of new skills. A number of evidence-based programs supported by the Bureau are offered in a group format. The provision of outpatient mental health care for inmates with mental illness is detailed in the\nProgram Statement Treatment and Care of Inmates with Mental Illness. b. Reentry Programming. Psychology Services clinicians are uniquely qualified to provide\nreentry-related cognitive-behavioral interventions. Specifically, reentry programming is offered to\naddress risk factors associated with criminal conduct; i.e., criminogenic needs.",

In addition,\nprograms that effectively address criminogenic needs have also been shown to reduce institution\nmisconduct. Reentry programming is offered in the context of a PTP; e.g., Journal Groups in RDAP. In\naddition, psychologists may offer reentry programming independent of a PTP; i.e., on an outpatient\n(nonresidential) basis; e.g., Anger Management Group, Criminal Thinking Group. Outpatient\nreentry programming relies on empirically supported interventions, primarily REBT. Relying on\nREBT as a guiding model creates theoretical continuity, ensuring that learning and practice are\nbuilt upon similar principles regardless of the institution, treatment provider, or treatment program\nin which they occur. REBT emphasizes the learning and practice of skills associated with\nadaptive, pro-social behavior. Therefore, inmates who participate in REBT are better able to\nachieve goals the Bureau has for all inmates, including responsibility, self-awareness, and\nindependence. Outpatient reentry programming groups may be open or closed, are evidence-based, and:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Use an established Bureau protocol and demonstrate fidelity to this model. Are facilitated by a psychologist. Meet at least every other week. Have a continuity in membership, no greater than 12 participants. P5310.17 8/25/2016 20 c. Restrictive Housing Interventions. In conjunction with its reentry mission, Psychology\nServices utilizes a variety of strategies to intervene with inmates in restrictive housing settings. These strategies include:\n\u25a0 Prevention. Through early intervention, prevention strategies decrease the likelihood inmates\nwill engage in behaviors which result in restrictive housing placement. Examples of\nprevention strategies include the BRAVE Program, outpatient Criminal Thinking and Anger\nManagement groups, and outreach efforts to reduce the likelihood inmates with a history of sex\noffenses will seek protective custody. \u25a0 Diversion. Diversion strategies offer alternative approaches to the management of inmate\nmisconduct, and other behaviors, which typically lead to restrictive housing placement. Examples of diversion strategies include Psychology Services involvement in the Inmate\nDiscipline Program and Psychology Services review of SMU and ADX Referrals. \u25a0 Mitigation. Mitigation strategies reduce the likelihood restrictive housing placements will\nhave an adverse impact on inmates. Examples of mitigation strategies are routine rounds in\nrestrictive housing units, referrals to recreation programs, the Psychology Advisory List, and\nspecialty mental health training for staff working in restrictive housing units. \u25a0 Intervention. Intervention strategies provide direct clinical and supportive services in\nrestrictive housing settings. Intervention strategies in restrictive housing may include routine\npsychological services, outpatient mental health treatment, reentry programming, or protocols\nspecifically designed for use in restrictive housing settings; e.g., Turning Point.\n\u25a0 Transition. Transition strategies provide opportunities for inmates to successfully transition\nfrom restrictive housing to general population or to the community. The Reintegration\nHousing Unit, which serves inmates with a lengthy history of protective custody placements, is\nan example of a transition strategy. \u25a0 Oversight. Oversight strategies involve Central Office quality assurance reviews of restrictive\nhousing placements, to include reviews of specific inmates in long-term restrictive housing\nplacements. The Branch\u2019s Restrictive Housing Initiatives Sallyport page contains restrictive housing resource\nmaterials and details programs, procedures, and practices related to each Psychology Services\nrestrictive housing strategy.",

Turning Point Handouts for Restrictive Housing. The Turning Point handouts for restrictive\nhousing offer a nationally standardized approach to pretreatment and rapport building for inmates\nin this setting. Turning Point handouts are to be utilized as the primary in-cell self-help resource\nfor inmates in restrictive housing. Psychologists are required to offer Turning Point handouts to\nany inmate housed in SHU for more than 30 days; however, use of the protocol is voluntary and P5310.17 8/25/2016 21 inmates may refuse to make use of the materials. Turning Point is not a treatment program, it is a\nset of adjunctive materials used as a toolkit for intervening with inmates in restrictive housing. The Turning Point handouts build on the concepts and skills taught in the Bureau\u2019s evidence- based\nPTPs (e.g., RDAP, Challenge Program) and outpatient Priority Practices (e.g., Criminal Thinking\nGroups). The two primary goals of the Turning Point handouts are: (1) to engender positive\nrapport and cooperative interaction with Psychology Services staff, and (2) to motivate and prepare\ninmates for participation in evidence-based programs upon their return to the general population. The handouts also offer suggestions to improve coping and adjustment in SHU, as well as a\npreliminary discussion of reentry-related issues; e.g., preparing to change, attitudes, and criminal\nthinking. The handouts are organized into sets or series, which are generally completed in a\nprescribed sequence. The Turning Point handouts for restrictive housing, and accompanying\nresource materials, are available on the Branch\u2019s Restrictive Housing Sallyport page. For\ninformation about how to obtain other Turning Point protocols (e.g., Turning Point for SOMP),\ncontact the Psychology Services Branch. d. Crisis Intervention. The Chief Psychologist ensures a system is in place to respond promptly\nto emergency Psychology Services referrals, to include establishment of a fair and equitable on call\nMental Health Duty Officer rotation for the department. After-hours referrals by staff are\ndiscussed by telephone with the Mental Health Duty Officer, who assesses and responds to the\nmental health needs of the inmate in ways that meet acceptable clinical, community, and\ncorrectional standards. The Mental Health Duty Officer determines how best to respond to the\nemergency, using a full range of clinical options; e.g., talking with the inmate and staff via\ntelephone, or going into the institution. When a staff member makes a referral based on observed\nbehavior or inmate statements, the psychologist who interviews the inmate ordinarily interviews\nthe referring staff member. The referring staff member\u2019s remarks are summarized in the clinical\nnotes. Psychologists provide crisis intervention services in a variety of contexts. Most importantly,\npsychologists work actively to prevent inmate suicides. Suicide prevention is a vital function of\nthe agency, which contributes directly to the safety and security of staff and inmates. Specific\nrequirements for intervening with suicidal inmates are found in the Program Statement Suicide\nPrevention Program. Potentially suicidal inmates are not the only inmates who may warrant crisis intervention services.",

Specific\nrequirements for intervening with suicidal inmates are found in the Program Statement Suicide\nPrevention Program. Potentially suicidal inmates are not the only inmates who may warrant crisis intervention services. For example, inmates who have recently experienced a very significant loss, a serious assault or\ninjury, or a highly charged interpersonal conflict may benefit from crisis intervention services. In\nthese instances, when there is no suggestion of suicide risk, crisis intervention contacts are\ndocumented in PDS as a Crisis Intervention note. P5310.17 8/25/2016 22 e. Management of Disruptive Behaviors. The Chief Psychologist ensures Psychology Services\nstaff assist appropriately with the identification and management of disruptive inmates, in\nparticular those inmates with mental illness. Identification of potentially disruptive inmates\nreduces the risk of harm to staff and other inmates. Potentially disruptive inmates may be\nhighlighted in the institution\u2019s Psychology Advisory List. Bureau psychologists may be asked to lend their expertise as behavioral scientists to the\nmanagement of disruptive inmates. Psychologists\u2019 understanding of de-escalation techniques and\nother communication skills; antisocial attitudes and behaviors; interactions between criminality,\nmental illness, and substance abuse; and basic principles of behavior therapy contribute to their\nability to assist in the management of disruptive behavior. Psychologists\u2019 value as behavioral scientists lies in two primary domains. First, psychologists have\nthe ability to advise Executive Staff on broad environmental issues that, if changed, may prevent or\nminimize future incidences of disruptive behavior and ensure all staff appreciate the essential role\nof positive reinforcement, consistency, and responsiveness in the effective management of\ninmates. Second, psychologists have the ability to actively engage in rapport building with\ninmates to increase their leverage and credibility in confrontation avoidance situations. Although Psychology Services Departments are committed to applying behavioral sciences\nexpertise to assist with inmate management, the effectiveness of these approaches is limited by the\ninstitutional context. Specifically, contingencies cannot be closely controlled in most settings,\ntherefore, the impact of behavioral management interventions on an individual level is often\nconstrained. When lending their behavioral sciences expertise to inmate management,\npsychologists must ensure any efforts to manipulate environmental factors to control inmate\nbehavior are consistent with relevant ethical guidelines; i.e., the efforts are not limited to various\nforms of deprivation. Collaboration with Correctional Services staff in the development of contingency contracts, which\nrely heavily on positive reinforcement, is the behavioral management approach most likely to\nresult in favorable behavior change. Additional information regarding the use of contingency\ncontracts is available on the Branch\u2019s Sallyport page. When psychologists intervene with disruptive inmates, these contacts may be documented in PDS\nin a variety of notes, depending on the specific nature of the contact; e.g., Disruptive Behavior\nInterventions, Suicide Risk Assessment, Suicide Risk Management Plan, Contingency Contract. P5310.17 8/25/2016 23 7.

Sex Offender Treatment Services. Specifics are described in the Program Statement Sex\nOffender Programs. 8. PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES\nPsychology Services staff collaborate routinely with Health Services staff to ensure inmates with a\nneed for psychiatric consultation and treatment receive these services. Psychology Services staff\nplay a significant role in referring inmates for psychiatric treatment, promoting medication\ncompliance, and identifying a need for involuntary medication. Specific strategies to support\ncollaboration between Psychology Services and Health Services are detailed in the Program\nStatement Treatment and Care of Inmates with Mental Illness. In addition, Psychology\nServices staff may consult with Health Services staff in the treatment of inmates with substance use\ndisorders and sex offense histories. Psychologists should be familiar with the Program Statements\ngoverning the delivery of psychiatric services, to include Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment\nand Psychiatric Services. 9. CONTINUITY OF CARE Ensuring continuity of care for inmates throughout their incarceration and as they reenter society is\nan essential Psychology Services function. Psychology services staff support continuity of care\nthrough: P5310.17 8/25/2016 24 \u25a0 Provision of community-based treatment services for inmates transitioning through RRCs and\nHome Confinement, to ensure mental health needs are appropriately addressed during this\ncritical time. \u25a0 Clear, accurate, and sufficiently detailed documentation in PDS, to include timely completion\nof Mental Health Transfer Summaries as appropriate. \u25a0 Timely and appropriate follow-up care consistent with the treating clinician\u2019s professional\njudgment and stated recommendations. \u25a0 Review of available relevant documentation; e.g., PDS, BEMR, SENTRY. \u25a0 Communication with Psychology Services staff in other relevant institutions. \u25a0 Collaborative reentry partnerships with key Bureau staff in Unit Management, Health Services,\nCommunity Treatment Services, Reentry Affairs, and Residential Reentry Management. \u25a0 Collaborative reentry partnerships with key agencies and organizations; e.g., U.S. Probation,\nCourt Services and Offender Supervision Agency, Social Security Administration. Continuity of care procedures are detailed in program-specific Psychology Services Program\nStatements; i.e., Psychology Treatment Programs, Sex Offender Programs, Treatment and\nCare of Inmates with Mental Illness, and Community Transitional Drug Abuse Treatment. 10. PROFESSIONAL DOCUMENTATION Professional documentation benefits inmates and mental health clinicians through the\ndocumentation of treatment plans, services provided, and progress in treatment. Per the APA\u2019s\ncurrent guidelines on record-keeping: \u201cRecord keeping documents the psychologist\u2019s planning and\nimplementation of an appropriate course of services, allowing the psychologist to monitor his or\nher work. Records may be especially important when there are significant periods of time between\ncontacts or when the client seeks services from another professional. Appropriate records can also\nhelp protect both the client and the psychologist in the event of legal or ethical proceedings.\u201d",

He/she must implement a system of control to\nensure timely recording of verbal and written psychological information about inmates. a. PDS. The PDS is the Bureau\u2019s official documentation system for psychological services. Consequently, all psychological services provided by Psychology Services staff are to be\ndocumented in PDS. Psychology Services staff strive to maintain accurate, current, and pertinent\nrecords of professional services. Crisis-related contacts should be documented as soon as possible,\nand always within 24 hours; crisis-related contacts include Suicide Risk Assessments, Suicide\nWatch Contacts, Post Suicide Watch Reports, Crisis Interventions, and Sexual Assault\nInterventions. Other individual clinical contacts are documented in PDS normally on the day they\noccur, or within three working days. P5310.17 8/25/2016 25 Psychology Services staff use the formats, headers, and templates provided in PDS for their\ndocumentation. PDS also allows local templates to be developed for most types of contacts or\nservices. If documentation templates are developed locally, they must include the basic\nrequirements of the national templates provided in PDS, and may not reduce or eliminate any\ndocumentation categories required by the national format. Psychology Services is committed to maintaining electronic files whenever possible. Consequently,\nsupplemental mental health documentation (e.g., forms, outside records) is uploaded to the\nDocument Manager in BEMR. All supplemental mental health documentation placed in the\nDocument Manager is linked to a clinical note in PDS to facilitate easy identification of the\ndocument. Supplemental documentation should be legible, to ensure the electronic record has the\nsame integrity as a hard copy paper file. Clinical services and corresponding PDS-generated entries documented by practicum students,\npsychology pre-doctoral interns, and post-doctoral residents are reviewed by a licensed\npsychologist within the department before being released to the inmates\u2019 permanent PDS record. PDS documentation guides and resource materials are available on Sallyport. b. SENTRY. In addition, Psychology Services SENTRY assignments are utilized to document\nand disseminate information to Bureau staff working outside of Psychology Services and Health\nServices. Psychology Services SENTRY assignments communicate essential psychological\ninformation to Bureau staff. For example, DRG and PTP assignments provide the Unit Team with\ninformation regarding an inmate\u2019s participation in programs, and the CMA assignment of PSY\nALERT (Psychology Alert) advises Correctional Officers of an inmate who may experience\nsignificant adjustment issues at the time of transfer. Psychology Services SENTRY assignments\nare referenced in applicable Program Statements and referenced on Sallyport. c. Privacy and Confidentiality. Psychology Services staff respect the privacy of inmates who\ndisclose personal information. Inmates should be informed PDS data is not entirely confidential\nand can be released to a law enforcement entity with a need to know; e.g., Bureau attorney, U.S.\nDepartment of Justice employee, U.S. Probation Officer, or other law enforcement personnel.",

In furtherance of suicide prevention and the effective\nmanagement of inmates with significant mental health issues, the Chief Psychologist is responsible\nfor sharing basic mental health information about inmates on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis. Specifically,\nPsychology Services Departments ensure institution staff are made aware of inmates with serious\nmental illnesses, risk of suicide, and/or risk of sexual predation. This information is communicated\nto staff via the Psychology Advisory List, which is disseminated electronically to all staff. In\naddition to identifying an inmate with significant mental health issues, the list advises staff\nregarding potential behaviors of concern and offers recommendations for interacting effectively\nwith the inmate. Important information related to the mental health issues of inmates in restrictive\nhousing is also shared during SHU meetings and/or via the SHU Report. e. Release of Information. An inmate may review his/her PDS records by submitting a request\nto Psychology Services. Prior to releasing the inmate\u2019s records, a psychologist must review the\nrecords to determine if release of this information would present harm to either the inmate or other\nindividuals. If concerns are noted, the psychologist consults the Chief Psychologist to determine an\nappropriate course of action. Any record determined not to present harm will be released to the\ninmate at the conclusion of the review. If any records are identified by a psychologist as not to be\nreleasable based upon the presence of harm, the Chief Psychologist will review the records and\nmake the final determination regarding appropriateness for release. If a portion of the records are\nwithheld, the inmate will be so advised in writing and provided the address of the Freedom of\nInformation Act office to which the inmate may address a formal request for the withheld records. Proprietary information (e.g., raw test data or answer sheets) should not be released if disclosure\nwould compromise the integrity and usefulness of the test. Inmates may not review the electronic\nmedical record directly. Inmates may only review and/or receive copies of records printed from\nthe electronic medical record.",

PSYCHOLOGY SERVICES WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT Psychology Services workforce development efforts are broad in scope and include discipline\nspecific and interdisciplinary professional development activities. Discipline specific workforce\ndevelopment activities include training and continuing professional education for Psychology\nServices staff; scholarly professional activities; community outreach and other recruitment\nstrategies; the demonstration of maintenance of clinical proficiency; and student training programs. a. Recruitment and Retention. The responsibility for recruiting and retaining a highly qualified\nPsychology Services workforce is shared by all agency psychologists, as well as Executive Staff. The Bureau employs a series of targeted recruitment strategies aimed at maximizing the agency\u2019s\nability to recruit capable and skilled mental health professionals. These recruitment and retention\nstrategies include, but are not limited to:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Comprehensive knowledge of Bureau hiring procedures and practices. Close tracking and monitoring of Psychology Services vacancies. Ties to professional colleagues and academic institutions. Community outreach efforts; i.e., professional publications and presentations. Recruitment booths, and related efforts, at professional conferences. Student training programs; i.e., psychology practicum, internship, and post-doctoral resident\nprograms. Paid advertisements in professional trade journals, publications, and websites. Use of social media to raise awareness of the Bureau as a desirable career path. Employee incentives; e.g., above the minimum rate, entry age waiver, student loan repayment,\nrecruitment/relocation/retention incentive. Support for professional licensure and certification. b. Professional Education for Psychology Services Staff. Bureau psychologists and treatment\nspecialists are expected to develop and maintain expertise as correctional mental health\nprofessionals. Specifically, Psychology Services clinicians must be knowledgeable about a wide\nrange of diagnoses, assessment instruments, and evidence-based treatment interventions. Psychologists and treatment specialists working in specific program areas are also required to\ndevelop and maintain expertise specific to these areas; e.g., sex offender treatment, substance\nabuse treatment. In support of this expertise, mandatory national training is provided for\nP5310.17 8/25/2016 28 psychologists and treatment specialists, as detailed in the Program Statement Employee\nDevelopment Manual. Clinical supervision is also provided to develop and maintain the expertise\nof Bureau clinicians. Continuing Professional Education. The Bureau is committed to providing continuing education\nopportunities to psychologists and treatment specialists to increase their expertise in working with\ncorrectional populations. Staff are afforded adequate time to participate in continuing education\nopportunities recommended by the Branch.",

The Bureau is committed to providing continuing education\nopportunities to psychologists and treatment specialists to increase their expertise in working with\ncorrectional populations. Staff are afforded adequate time to participate in continuing education\nopportunities recommended by the Branch. Subject to the availability of funding, the Bureau\u2019s\nContinuing Professional Education (CPE) Program offers psychologists and treatment specialists\nthe opportunity to address individual continuing education needs through participation in\nworkshops, seminars, and training sessions. Priority is given to those who need access to CPE\nhours for licensure or certification; i.e., seeking or maintaining professional licensure or\ncertification. Funding of CPE is limited to training that offers knowledge and skills directly related to clinical\npractice in corrections. The Branch identifies and approves training consistent with this objective. The Branch has been approved by the APA, under current guidelines, to sponsor continuing\neducation for psychologists for certain Bureau-sponsored training programs. The Branch maintains\nresponsibility for this program and its content. Chief Psychologists are encouraged to gain\napproval from the Branch to provide local CPE training for psychologists at their facility and\nnearby facilities. The Branch may also grant National Association of Drug Abuse and Alcohol\nCounselors (NAADAC), International Credentialing and Reciprocity Consortium (ICRC), or stateapproved CPE hours or credits for Bureau-sponsored programs. To maximize taxpayer value,\nCPEs are offered in the most cost-effective format available. When feasible, web-based and selfstudy training opportunities are the preferred method of obtaining CPEs. However, the distinct\nvalue of in-person, interactive CPE training is recognized and supported when funding allows. These programs offer Bureau psychologists and treatment specialists additional opportunities to\naccumulate CPE hours or credits necessary to maintain professional licensure or certification. c. Scholarly Professional Activities. The academic preparation that many psychologists acquire\nduring their graduate training in such areas as basic statistics and research design enables them to\nbe useful in the production of scholarship, including designing and participating in institutional,\nlocal, regional, or national research and program evaluation efforts. Such professional activities\ncontribute to the information and knowledge available in the field of corrections. As a mechanism\nfor learning and making practice more effective, scholarly activities may assist in staff retention. Finally, these activities support the profession and help recruit new staff who, as graduate students\nin doctoral-level clinical and counseling psychology programs, are often consumers of the\nscholarship. P5310.17 8/25/2016 29 (1) Research Approval Process. Research proposals generated at the institution level are\nsubmitted to and reviewed by the institution\u2019s Local Research Review Board Research Committee\nand the Warden. Research proposals submitted by Bureau psychologists should be, as much as\npossible, of an applied nature. Typically, the Chief Psychologist chairs the institution\u2019s Local\nResearch Review Board, and may have primary responsibility to ensure project completion. When research is being proposed by a psychologist, another psychologist is always the chairperson\nfor that reviewing research committee. Following approval at the institution level, research proposals are submitted to the Regional\nDirector for review. Following Regional Office approval, the Chief, Office of Research and\nEvaluation, reviews and approves all research for the Director of the Bureau. Proposals for\nresearch that include subject sampling from multiple sites are routed directly to the Chief, Office of\nResearch and Evaluation.",

Additional details are available in the Program Statement Research. (2) Publications and Presentations. Psychologists may communicate their expertise to other\nprofessionals in the field to share information, coordinate activities, and find solutions to common\nproblems. To this end, psychologists may publish professional articles or present at professional\nconferences. Officially assigned publication and presentation activities, such as a journal article or\na conference presentation, are reviewed by the employee\u2019s supervisor, as with any other work\nproduct. A disclaimer is required for publications when the topic is corrections or criminal\njustice, and if the employee will be identified as a Bureau or Department of Justice (DOJ)\nemployee or the publication\u2019s content could be construed as representing the views, policies, or\npractices of the Bureau or DOJ.

Assessment of Psychologist Competencies. Psychologists provide clinical care consistent with\ntheir requisite knowledge and skills. Psychologists\u2019 expertise is maintained over time through\ncontinuing practice and professional education. As evidence-based treatments evolve over time\nand new treatment technologies emerge, psychologists are responsible for maintaining and\nimproving professional competencies. Through the assessment of professional competencies, the\nBureau ensures psychologists deliver quality care consistent with current standards of practice. Consistent with professional standards, psychologists are expected to demonstrate and maintain\nclinical proficiency. Psychologists\u2019 competencies are demonstrated through professional\ncredentials and core clinical skills, and maintained through participation in clinical supervision and\nthe completion of CPE. P5310.17 8/25/2016 30 (1) Professional Credentials. Consistent with professional standards, Bureau psychologists are\ndoctoral-level, licensed or license-eligible clinical or counseling psychologists. Bureau\npsychologists are strongly encouraged to obtain and maintain professional licensure. Certain\npositions require licensure to satisfactorily perform their duties; e.g., Chief Psychologist, Internship\nProgram Coordinator, Forensic Psychologist. The Chief Psychologist maintains a current credentials portfolio for each psychologist in the\ndepartment. This portfolio will be secured in a GSA security-approved safe or equivalent as\napproved by the institution\u2019s Information Security Officer. Safes will be locked when staff\nmembers are not in their office. Each employee has the right to review or receive a copy of any\ninformation in his/her credentials portfolio. The portfolio contains the following documents, along\nwith primary source verification for these credentials:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Documentation of professional education (diploma or transcript). Documentation of post-graduate specialization or credentials (if applicable). A copy of current professional licensures/certifications (if applicable). Documentation of an externally validated Core Clinical Skills Review (as applicable). If applicable, psychologists are responsible for providing a copy of their renewed professional\nlicenses or certifications, or evidence of application to renew, to the Chief Psychologist or\nCompetency Assessment Psychologist on or before the date the current license or certification\nexpires.",

(2) Core Clinical Skills of Correctional Psychologists. The work of Bureau psychologists is\nroutinely reviewed to ensure adherence to professional standards. The primary purpose of this\nreview is to identify and address training needs in order to ensure the quality of the Bureau\u2019s\nclinical services. At a minimum, a review of core clinical skills is conducted every two years. Core clinical skills include:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Screening for mental health concerns. Psychological assessment. Diagnostic formulation. Treatment planning. Clinical intervention. Professional documentation. Reviews of clinical skills are conducted by doctoral-level, license-eligible psychologists. For\nbargaining unit psychologists, the clinical supervisor conducts the review. Under no circumstances P5310.17 8/25/2016 31 does a bargaining unit psychologist conduct a clinical skills review of another bargaining unit\npsychologist. Typically, reviews of non-bargaining unit psychologists are also conducted by their\nclinical supervisor; however, they may be conducted by other non-bargaining unit psychologists. Non-clinicians are not qualified to conduct a review of clinical skills; therefore, reviews of Chief\nPsychologists are conducted by psychologists in the Psychology Services Branch. New Bureau psychologists receive their first clinical skills review at the conclusion of the first year\nof their appointment, in conjunction with completion of their annual performance appraisal. All\nclinical skills reviews are submitted to the Psychology Services Branch for external review and\nvalidation. Specific review procedures for bargaining unit psychologists, non-bargaining unit\npsychologists, and Chief Psychologists are described below. Core clinical skills may be reviewed through:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Clinical supervision. Review of clinical documentation. Direct observation of the delivery of treatment services. Informal discussion of clinical cases and formal case presentations. At a minimum, clinical skills are assessed through a review of key clinical documentation with\nfeedback, using the Core Clinical Skills Review Form. Completed forms are submitted to the\nPsychology Services Branch for review and external validation. (3) Chief Psychologists. The Psychology Services Branch is responsible for conducting clinical\nskills reviews of Chief Psychologists; these reviews are to be conducted every two years. Clinical\nskills reviews of Chief Psychologists address:\n\u25a0 The Chief Psychologist\u2019s effectiveness in the performance of professional duties, which\ninclude providing services and programs to address inmate needs. \u25a0 The Chief Psychologist\u2019s ability to establish and maintain communication within and outside\nthe organization to provide effective services. \u25a0 The Chief Psychologist\u2019s skill in extending professional and technical advice, including clinical\nsupervision, to improve the effectiveness of services to offenders. For Chief Psychologists, the clinical skills reviews consist of a telephonic interview and\ncompletion of the Core Clinical Skills Review Form. The form is used to document the review\nfindings. The Chief Psychologist is provided with a copy of the form and the original is retained in\nthe Psychology Services Branch. P5310.17 8/25/2016 32",

(4) Non-Bargaining Unit Psychologists. The Chief Psychologist, or another non-bargaining unit\npsychologist designated by the Chief Psychologist, reviews the core clinical skills of nonbargaining unit psychologists in the department. These clinical skills reviews are conducted\nevery two years. The clinical skills review considers the psychologist\u2019s effectiveness in the\nperformance of clinical duties, as reflected in the quality of the following documentation:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Intake Screenings.

The Chief Psychologist or Deputy\nChief Psychologist develops the training plan in collaboration with the non-bargaining unit\npsychologist and shares responsibility for its successful completion. Upon successful completion\nof the plan, a follow-up review may be conducted using the same procedures. (5) Bargaining Unit Psychologists. The bargaining unit psychologist\u2019s clinical supervisor\nassesses his/her core clinical skills every two years, at a minimum. The clinical skills review\nconsiders the psychologist\u2019s effectiveness in the performance of clinical duties, as reflected in the\nquality of the following documentation:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Intake Screenings.",

Student Training Programs. Student training programs fulfill a vital role in the Bureau by the\nsupporting the development of a well-trained pool of correctional psychologists for future Bureau\nemployment. These students also provide a valuable service to the Bureau, by providing direct\ncare for inmates. (1) Graduate Student Practicum. A senior licensed psychologist with an expressed interest in\ntraining students is designated by the Chief Psychologist to oversee the graduate student practicum\nprogram. This psychologist is primarily responsible for organizing and supervising a graduate\nstudent practicum. He/she administers the practicum curriculum at his/her institution, is\nresponsible for the integrity and quality of the training, and has administrative authority\ncommensurate with those responsibilities. The curriculum is tailored to each student\u2019s level of\nexperience and a signed training agreement is kept by the supervising psychologist. The student\u2019s\nlevel of experience may be assessed through an interview of the student, a review of his/her\neducational transcript and prior training experiences, and consultation with his/her clinical director. A non-bargaining unit psychologist, ordinarily the Chief Psychologist, will make the final\ndetermination regarding the duties to be assigned to the student.",

A non-bargaining unit psychologist, ordinarily the Chief Psychologist, will make the final\ndetermination regarding the duties to be assigned to the student. Graduate students enrolled in clinical or counseling doctoral-level psychology programs or related\nmental health professions may be considered for a practicum. One purpose of the practicum is to\nexpose students to direct services offered to inmates and help them become familiar with the\npolicies and procedures of Psychology Services. The other purpose is to assess the students\u2019 fit\nwith corrections work and to encourage consideration of corrections as a career choice. Practicum\nis designed to build upon, not introduce, foundational competencies of professional psychology. Thus, students selected for practicum are ordinarily in their second or third year of graduate study\nand have already had one supervised direct service training experience. A graduate student practicum may be offered through volunteer, contractor, or student temporary\nemployment position authorities. Upon completion of personnel procedures, typically completed\nby Human Resources staff unless other procedures are negotiated at the local level, students\nappointed as volunteers may be issued unescorted volunteer badges. Wardens are the approving\nauthority for unescorted volunteer badges. Students may also have access to document clinical\nservices within PDS. Documentation of services provided is reviewed by the supervising licensed\nP5310.17 8/25/2016 35 psychologist before release to the inmate\u2019s record. Regularly scheduled supervision is provided\nby the licensed supervising psychologist. (2) Pre-doctoral Internship Program. Pre-doctoral Internship Programs are approved by\nExecutive Staff and are seeking or have obtained accreditation by the APA. The Psychology\nServices Branch maintains oversight of these programs. The Central Office allocates internship\npositions to specific institutions that have met guidelines for clinical training. Pre-doctoral Internship Programs are available to psychology graduate students in Clinical or\nCounseling Psychology and provide a high-quality, generalist training experience. The goal of the\nprogram is to prepare entry level professional psychologists who can also function competently in\na correctional environment. \u25a0 Professional Standards. Pre-doctoral Internship Programs operate in accordance with the\nmost recent APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, APA Practice\nStandards, and Bureau Standards of Employee Conduct. The programs are accredited based on\ncriteria established by the APA and membership criteria and bylaws of the Association of\nPsychology Post-doctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC). \u25a0 Administration.

Applicants also complete a standard Office of\nPersonnel Management Application (SF-171) and any other materials requested by the\nparticular internship site (work samples, letter of intent, etc.). These are sent to the Internship\nProgram Coordinator (IPC) at the institution(s) at which they wish to be considered. Prospective intern applicants are made aware of two limiting factors related to consideration. The pre-doctoral internship program is the Bureau\u2019s core strategy for recruiting psychologists\nwho are uniquely qualified for clinical practice in the Bureau. Thus, applicants who do not fit\nP5310.17 8/25/2016 36 employment criteria outlined in Public Law 100-238 may not be selected. This information\nwill be clearly conveyed to all intern applicants on the Bureau\u2019s public website. Prospective interns selected for interviews complete a pre-employment interview, including\nfingerprinting, NCIC check, urinalysis, and physical examination, at the nearest Bureau\ninstitution before beginning their training. Internship candidates must meet all criteria for\nBureau employment. Offers of internship positions are made according to APPIC\nguidelines and are considered tentative until pre-employment personnel procedures are\nsuccessfully completed and until funding for the program is allotted by Congress. This\ninformation will be clearly conveyed to applicants on the Bureau\u2019s public website. \u25a0 Interns ordinarily begin their internship in July or August. They complete the equivalent of 1\nyear of full-time training in no less than 12 months. Interns complete Introduction to\nCorrectional Techniques I.

Their primary responsibilities include intern recruitment and selection, as\nwell as coordinating, directing, and organizing training activities and curriculum at their\nfacility. Training for practice is reflected in the curriculum, since training activities chosen are\nsequential, cumulative, and graded in complexity. These include:\n\uf0d8 Theories and methods of assessment and diagnosis and effective intervention, including\nevidence-based practices for mental health, substance abuse, and criminality. \uf0d8 Theories and methods of consultation, evaluation, and supervision. \uf0d8 Strategies of scholarly inquiry. \uf0d8 Issues of cultural and individual diversity relevant to all of the above. Guidelines for core curriculum items across Bureau internship sites are posted on Sallyport. The IPC is a licensed psychologist and has overall responsibility for the supervision of psychology\ninterns. The IPC devotes at least 50 percent of his/her time to activities directly related to the\ninternship program. The program also has intern training supervisors who are licensed doctoral\nlevel psychologists. In a program with a one-day-per-week outplacement at a co-located Bureau\nfacility, the intern is supervised by a licensed psychologist at that site.

(3) Post-doctoral Residency Training. The Bureau\u2019s Post-doctoral Residency Training is a 12month training opportunity offered to doctoral-level psychologists seeking advanced training in\ncorrectional psychology or a specialty area of emphasis. The specialty area represents an\nemerging, established, or growing agency need; e.g., sex offender treatment, substance abuse\ntreatment, intervening with violent offenders. Post-doctoral training and these positions are used to\nprovide the Bureau with a well-trained pool of applicants to fill psychologist vacancies at the GS12/13 levels. \u25a0 Professional Standards.

ANCILLARY STAFF SERVICES Bureau psychologists bring significant behavioral scientist expertise to the agency, which is of\nbenefit not only to inmates, but also to staff. Psychologists are typically involved in a number of\ninstitutional activities aimed at enhancing the knowledge, professionalism, and mental well-being\nof staff. In this context, psychologists are tasked with providing a variety of services for Bureau\nstaff, to include staff training, professional consultation, and Employee Assistance Program (EAP)\nservices. a. Staff Care. Psychologists take an active role in facilitating care for Bureau staff through their\ninvolvement in the EAP, as described in the Program Statement Employee Assistance Program,\nand Crisis Support Teams, as described in the Program Statement Correctional Services Manual. b. Staff Training. Psychologists assist in the provision of mandatory staff training, to include an\nactive role in Introduction to Correctional Techniques \u2013 I, Annual Training, Semi-Annual Suicide\nPrevention Training, and Quarterly Suicide Prevention Training for SHU Officers. (1) Introduction to Correctional Techniques - Phase I (ICT-I). Psychologists provide training\nto new employees during ICT-I. Ordinarily, this training includes:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 How to recognize and manage inmates with mental illness. How to recognize and intervene with potentially suicidal inmates. How to refer inmates to Psychology Services, to include Psychology Treatment Programs. The availability of services through the EAP. P5310.17 8/25/2016 40 (2) Annual Training. The core curriculum for Annual Training is determined annually by the\nBureau\u2019s Executive Staff. Typically, psychologists are involved in presenting information related\nto suicide prevention, mental illness, and EAP services. In addition, institutions with special\nmissions/programs related to Psychology Services; e.g., SOMP, RDAP, Skills Program, are\nafforded the opportunity to raise staff awareness about these missions/programs during Annual\nTraining. (3) Suicide Prevention Training. The Program Statement Suicide Prevention Program details\nmandatory suicide prevention training requirements. In addition, the Program Statement Treatment and Care of Inmates with Mental Illness outlines\nspecialty mental health training available at select sites. In addition to mandatory training, psychologists may offer supplemental psychological training to\ninterested Bureau staff. Additional psychological knowledge can be a valuable resource,\nenhancing staff\u2019s ability to effectively manage inmates. Learning more about key topics, such as\ncognitive behavioral treatment, criminal thinking, mental illness, and behavioral principles, affords\nBureau staff the opportunity to increase their expertise in these important areas and apply this\nknowledge directly to their interactions with inmates. Supplemental behavioral sciences-informed\ntraining and resource materials have been developed by the Branch and are made available to staff\non Sallyport and BOP-Learn. c. Professional Consultation. In addition to formalized staff training, psychologists also consult\nwith Bureau staff, offering their behavioral scientist expertise in a variety of settings.",
