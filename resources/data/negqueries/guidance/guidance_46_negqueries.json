Kane\nActing Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons\nThis Change Notice (CN) implements changes to Program Statement (PS) 5111.04, Institution\nHearing Program, dated July 3, 2006. It provides guidance and direction relating to Case\nManagement Activity (CMA) assignments, and processing/transferring foreign-born non-U.S.\ncitizens (aliens) from the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) to Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement (ICE). It also removes outdated procedures and terminology, and includes\nupdated procedures and processes. Deleted text is marked with a strikeout. Inserted text is marked\nin green. 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE To outline procedures for managing and designating foreign-born non-U.S. citizens (aliens) who\nare serving Federal sentences and who are eligible to participate in the Institution Hearing\nProgram (IHP). The IHP is a coordinated effort by between the Federal Bureau of Prisons (Bureau), the\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Executive Office for Immigration Review\n(EOIR), to provide deportation, exclusion, or removal proceedings to sentenced aliens. This PS provides the procedures to ensure the maximum number of eligible inmates in Bureau\ncustody participate in the IHP while serving their sentences. This process allows ICE to effect\ndeportation removal immediately upon completion of an inmate\u2019s sentence. 2. SUMMARY OF CHANGES\n\u25a0 SENTRY Case Management Activity (CMA) assignments of \u201cIHP DKT\u201d and \u201cIHP CMP WD\u201d\nare eliminated. \u25a0 New assignments of \u201cIHP CMPWDE\u201d and \u201cIHP CMPWDI\u201d have been added. \u25a0 The CMA assignment \u201cIHP PEND\u201d will be applied to any inmate who requires an IHP hearing,\nbut is not initially designated to a hearing site. \u25a0 IHP PEND and IHP PART will also be used for those cases where an inmate received an order\nof deportation during a previous sentence but the order needs to be reinstated by ICE. The\nCMA denoting \u201cwill deport\u201d remains in place until updated with a completed reinstatement. \u25a0 Attachment A has been updated to include new release sites. \u25a0 Procedures for assigning inmates to hearing or release beds have been clarified, and the\nimportance of reviewing CMA assignments on re-committed inmates is stressed. \u25a0 Length of sentence and time until projected release date are reduced for transfer referrals. \u25a0 The former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is now referred to as Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\u25a0 All references to stipulated deportation procedures have been removed.\n\u25a0 All references to IHP unit assignments have been removed. \u25a0 FCC Oakdale is now an Enhanced IHP site and all references to its exception to the Enhanced\nIHP have been removed. \u25a0 The following Case Management Activity (CMA) assignments have been deactivated: NO\nIHP; IHP CMPWDE; IHP CMPWDI; IHP CMP NP. \u25a0 New CMA assignments of IHP COMPLT, IHP NO HRG, and IHP INTRVW have been added.\n\u25a0 All references to release sites have been removed. \u25a0 Attachment A has been updated to include CMA assignment guidance and processes. 3. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. The expected results of this program are:\na. Inmates will be made available to ICE and EOIR for IHP processing prior to sentence\nexpiration. b. Eligible inmates will be identified and transferred to institutions designated as IHP sites.",

STANDARDS REFERENCED. None. 6. BACKGROUND. The Enhanced IHP was implemented on April 25, 1997, as a cooperative\neffort of the Bureau, Immigration and Naturalization Service, the former INS and now ICE, and\nEOIR to meet the Attorney General\u2019s mandate to ensure deportation proceedings begin as\nexpeditiously as possible after the date of conviction, and the proceedings are completed prior to\nthe expiration of the alien\u2019s sentence . This reduces the federal government\u2019s detention costs and enables the Bureau to manage its\npopulation better. 7 6. DEFINITIONS\n(a) IHP Hearing Site.

      "content": "Judicial deportation is issued only if requested by the U.S. Attorney, with the Director,\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s concurrence, and only if the Court chooses to exercise\nthis jurisdiction. An alien with a judicial order does not require designation to an IHP facility. If a Judicial Deportation is ordered, but the deportation order is not provided with other designation\nmaterials, a hearing site must be designated for the inmate. This information should be noted and\nthe SENTRY/security/designation data screen, but Bureau staff need not attempt to obtain a\ndeportation order. A condition of supervision requiring the offender to report to ICE for voluntary deportation does\nnot constitute a judicial deportation order. (e) Reinstatement of Prior Deportation Order. An alien who has been deported, but re-enters the\nUnited States may have the prior order reinstated. However, unless the actual reinstated order is\nprovided at the time of initial designation this information should be noted on the PPG0, and the\ninmate must be designated to a hearing site for processing by ICE. (f) Medically unassigned. An inmate who, because of medical restrictions, cannot be assigned to\nany work program. (g) Contract Detention Center. A facility the Bureau contracts with to house criminal aliens.

This should be documented on the\ne.g., NEEDS IHP, SUBMIT TRF REQUEST WHEN 48 - 60 MOS. REMAIN TO SERVE. 10 9. RE-DESIGNATION PROCEDURES. Inmates not having a hearing site designated. Normally, a referral for transfer to a hearing site will be submitted when an inmate has between\n48\u201360 months remaining to serve. If the Designator is still unable to re-designate a hearing site for\nthe inmate, justification will be entered on the CMC Clearance and Separatee Data form (PP10)\nand retained in the Inmate Central File. ICE will process inmates who were not re-designated to a hearing site at sentence expiration. 11 10. HEARING/RELEASE SITE PROCEDURES (a) Hearing Dockets. EOIR will provide a copy of the calendar docket to the CMC, or designated\nstaff member, approximately one week prior to the hearings. ICE and EOIR will coordinate and\ncomplete the deportation or exclusion hearings. A copy of the calendar docket will be obtained by\nthe CMC from either ICE or EOIR at intervals sufficient to provide for the inmate\u2019s attendance in\ncourt. (b) Hearing Room. The Warden will make available a suitable room for EOIR judge(s) or video\nteleconference equipment to conduct hearings. If new construction is needed, the Warden will\ncontact the CCD Administrator, who will coordinate with ICE Headquarters to cover the\nconstruction costs. (c b) Public Hearings Representatives. IHP hearings are considered public. An inmate\u2019s family\nmembers, friends, the media, and the public are eligible to attend. A representative is eligible to\nattend an IHP hearing.

If deportation is not ordered, ICE will remove its\ndetainer and provide written documentation to institution staff, which will be retained When\nremoval is not ordered at the conclusion of the administrative proceeding, a written copy of the\nfinal order should be placed in the J&C and Inmate Central Files. The lifting of an ICE detainer\nrequires a written notification provided by ICE. (a) 12 18 Months or Less Until Expiration of Sentence Projected Release Date. Inmates will normally remain at the hearing site for release processing (e.g., to CCC a Residential\nReentry Center [RRC]) and be assigned to general population. (b) More than 12 18 Months Until Expiration of Sentence Projected Release Date. Inmates will be transferred to general population at the hearing site or be referred for redesignation to any appropriate institution commensurate with security and programming needs. (2) Inmates Ordered Deported/Removed. If removal is ordered, coordinate with ICE regarding\nthe placement of an ICE detainer and obtaining a copy of the removal order for placement in the\ninmates J&C and Inmate Central Files. Release beds at hearing sites will be used primarily for\ninmates with 12 months or less until expiration of sentence. Ordinarily, once moved to a release\nsite, an inmate will remain there until his or her sentence expires. As more release beds become available, hearing site institutions may refer inmates with less than\n12 months remaining to release-only sites to prevent delaying the hearing process. Considerations\nshould include the proximity of release sites and availability of transportation to release sites. P5111.04, CN-1 5/23/2017 8 (a) 12 18 Months or Less Until Expiration of Sentence Projected Release Date. Inmates should be moved to a release bed remain at the hearing site, where they will normally\nremain for release processing. (b) More than 12 18 Months Until Expiration of Sentence Projected Release Date. Inmates should be referred for re-designation to a release site, normally an IHP facility with release\nbeds only commensurate with their security and programming needs. (3) Management Concerns. A transfer referral to any appropriate institution may be submitted\nfor justifiable reasons, such as CIM, concerns and disciplinary, or medical problems concerns. If\nthe inmate is unable to return to an IHP site prior to expiration of sentence, ICE will assume\ncustody at expiration of sentence. (4) Medical Concerns. Inmates requiring medical and/or psychiatric care shall be submitted for\ndesignation or re-designation under normal procedures. The referral to the medical designator will\nindicate the inmate\u2019s IHP status, e.g., NEEDS IHP HEARING; ORDERED DEPORTED - NEEDS\nRELEASE SITE; IHP COMPLETE - NOT ORDERED DEPORTED. Following completion of treatment, placement should be made the inmate should be referred for\nplacement at a hearing or release site.",

If a transfer to a medical center is for short-term purposes,\ne.g., surgery with return to parent institution, the CMC at the sending institution will advise ICE\nthat the inmate is expected to return to the parent institution. (5) Program Participation. Normally, inmates at hearing sites pending a hearing and inmates at\nrelease sites with orders of deportation will not be considered for transfer for program participation\nor for nearer release purposes. (6) Transfer to ICE Custody for the Hearing Process. A Memorandum of Understanding\ncontains instructions regarding the release of inmates to ICE custody at facilities where the\ncourtroom is outside the institution\u2019s secure perimeter. Procedures for transferring inmates with\nCIM assignments to ICE custody for hearings are contained in the CIM Manual. 12. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS (a) Detainers. Detainers and/or state sentences (concurrent or consecutive) do not affect IHP\nparticipation. P5111.04, CN-1 5/23/2017 9 (b) Administrative or Judicial Deportation Orders. An Administrative or Judicial Deportation\ncan be ordered prior to initial designation or can be given after an institution is designated for an\ninmate. (1) If deportation has been ordered prior to initial designation, ICE will provide a copy of the\ndeportation order to the USMS, which will be forwarded to the CCM office, along with the request\nfor designation. It will be noted on the Inmate Load and Security Designation form. (a) Ordinarily, a release site will be designated for inmates with less than 60 months remaining to\nserve. (b) Ordinarily, any appropriate institution will be designated for inmates with 60 months or more\nremaining to serve. It will be noted on the Inmate Load and Security Designation form (BP-337) that the inmate should\nbe referred for re-designation to a release site between 48-60 months of release. (2) If an Administrative or Judicial Deportation is ordered after initial designation for an inmate\nnot at a hearing site, the inmate will be transferred to a release site. (a) Ordinarily, a release site will be designated for inmates with less than 60 months remaining to\nserve. (b) Ordinarily, any appropriate institution will be designated for inmates with 60 months or more\nremaining to serve. The inmate should then be referred for redesignation to a release site between\n48-60 months of release. (3) The appropriate CMA assignment will be entered once the unit team is made aware of the\ndeportation order. (c) Determination of Hearing/Release Site. To expedite ICE deportation, whenever possible, a\nsite close to the eventual area of deportation should be designated for inmates. For example, Eastern Canadian and European citizens should be housed in the Northeast Region;\nMexican and Central and South American citizens should be housed in the South Central or\nWestern Region. (d) Other. Inmates not falling under the above guidelines will be referred to CCD for further\nguidance and direction. P5111.04, CN-1 5/23/2017 10 1311.

The ICE Officer-inCharge at the local ICE office will coordinate with institution staff to monitor the inmate\npopulation and identify aliens appropriate for the IHP. ICE will lodge a detainer if one has not\npreviously been lodged. 12. APPEALS (a) Appeals. Ordinarily, appeals of deportation/removal decisions do not require in-person\nhearings. EOIR provides appeal forms. Inmates at non-hearing sites should be advised to request\nappeal forms from:\nInmates appealing a deportation decision may be transferred to a Release Site prior to receiving the\nfinal deportation order or appeal decision. The CMA assignment will be updated. If the decision is overturned on appeal, the local ICE office will remove the detainer and notify the\ninstitution. The CMA assignment will be updated to reflect the new decision. EOIR provides appeal forms. Inmates at non-hearing sites should be advised to request appeal\nforms from:\nBoard of Immigration Appeals\nOffice of the Chief Clerk\nPO Box 8530 5107 Leesburg Pike, Suite 2000\nFalls Church, VA 22041 If an order is overturned on appeal, coordinate with your designated ICE POC regarding the lifting\nof ICE detainers, should any be present.

This assignment has been deactivated and is no longer applicable. Indicates that ICE has reviewed the inmate and has no interest. The CMAD is the date of the\ndecision order. If loaded, this is the final and only IHP CMA assignment. (d ) IHP CMP WD- IHP Complete Will Deport. This assignment has been deactivated;\nhowever, it may still exist on older or re-committed cases. Indicates the inmate completed the IHP\nprocess and received a deportation order. P5111.04, CN-1 5/23/2017 12 (e b) IHP CMPWDE- IHP Complete Will Deport EOIR. This assignment has been deactivated\nand is no longer applicable. Indicates a deportation decision resulting from an EOIR hearing. The\nCMAD is the date of the decision. (f c) IHP CMPWDI- IHP Complete Will Deport ICE. This assignment has been deactivated\nand is no longer applicable. Indicates ICE issued a deportation decision, such as reinstatement or\nan administrative removal order. The CMAD is the decision date. If a release site was designated for the inmate initially because documentation was available to\nindicate an order of deportation exists for the current offense, the CMA of IHP CMPWDI is\nentered. (g d) IHP CMP ND- IHP Complete No Deport. This assignment has been deactivated and is no\nlonger applicable. Indicates a decision was made not to deport the inmate after a hearing was\ncompleted. The CMAD is the decision date. If loaded, this is the final and only IHP CMA\nassignment. If an appeal decision is subsequently received, the CMA assignment and CMAD will be replaced\nas appropriate. When inmates are recommitted to the Bureau, IHP CMA assignments from the previous\ncommitment(s) must be reviewed at initial classification. If an inmate has an order of deportation\nthat was given during service of a previous sentence, the inmate does not have to have another\nhearing with EOIR. However, that order must be reinstated, which requires ICE to conduct an interview with the\ninmate. In these cases, the \u201cwill deport\u201d CMA and CMAD should remain, but add the CMA of\nIHP PEND if at a non-hearing site, or IHP PART if at a hearing site, to indicate the deportation\nprocess needs action, i.e., interview by ICE needed. Once the order is reinstated, the CMAD should be updated to the date of reinstatement and IHP\nPEND or PART should be removed. This will facilitate appropriate identification of inmates not\neligible for UNICOR, as the order of deportation itself remains valid, even though it may need to\nbe reinstated.",
