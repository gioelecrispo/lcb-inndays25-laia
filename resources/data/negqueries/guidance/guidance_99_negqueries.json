ADMINISTRATION Providing health care within a correctional environment presents unique challenges not\nencountered by practitioners elsewhere. The Health Services Division\u2019s goal is to provide\nmedically necessary health care services. On occasion, there may be an incompatibility between medical and correctional guidelines;\nconflicts related to medical care should be resolved, as far as practical, in favor of medicine. At\nthe same time, the medical staff must be part of the institution\u2019s correctional team. a. Delegation of Authority. The Director\u2019s authority to provide for the care and treatment of\npersons charged or convicted of offenses against the United States has been delegated to the\nAssistant Director, Health Services Division (HSD). The Assistant Director, HSD, directs and\nadministers all activities related to the physical and psychiatric care of inmates, the Bureau\u2019s\nSafety and Environmental Health Program, and Food and Farm Services. The Assistant Director, HSD, has delegated the clinical direction and administration of all\nactivities related to the physical and psychiatric care of inmates to the Medical Director. The\nMedical Director is the final health care authority for all clinical issues. The Director delegates to the Regional Directors and Wardens authority to make\nrecommendations to the appropriate judge regarding the mental competency of inmates. The\nDirector retains the authority to audit and review any action taken under these delegations. b. Core Principles. The following core principles support the Health Services Mission\nStatement:\n\u25a0 Human Value. All inmates have value as human beings and deserve medically necessary\nhealth care. \u25a0 Public Safety. Health care for inmates must be delivered within the constraints of\ncorrectional concerns and responsibilities inherent to the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 overall mission. P6010.05 06/26/2014 2 \u25a0 Inmate Rights and Responsibilities. Inmates must understand their right to access health\ncare as well as their responsibilities to participate in health care in a manner that ensures\nmaximal benefit from offered services. \u25a0 Evidence-Based Care. Standards of care for inmates will employ proven treatment\nstrategies, generally supported by outcome data. \u25a0 Public Health.",

The PCA/DCA is taxable and is considered to\nbe a portion of the recipient\u2019s base pay for purposes of compensation, lump sum payments,\nworkers\u2019 compensation, and life insurance benefits. Applicability of the PCA/DCA to retirement\ncomputation is found in section l.(1).\n(3) When a physician/dentist has to repay a Federal loan that has an optional provision for\nwaiver of all or part of the loan in return for service, the physician/dentist will have the amount\ndeducted from any PCA/DCA. (4) A PCA/DCA may not be paid to any physician/dentist who:\n\u25a0 Is employed on less than a half-time or intermittent basis. \u25a0 Occupies an internship or residency training program.\n\u25a0 Is a re-employed annuitant, or is fulfilling a scholarship obligation (i.e., a National Health\nService Corps scholarship or any other scholarship program that requires repayment by\nGovernment service). (5) Physicians/dentists granted Leave Without Pay (LWOP) while under a service contract must\nhave their PCA/DCA payments terminated during the period of absence. Payments of a prorated amount of the PCA/DCA under the expired portion of the contract will\nresume upon return to the same position. No part of the LWOP may be counted toward meeting the 24-month Federal service requirement. l. Applicability to Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees\nRetirement System (FERS)\n(1) Computation Rules. No part of a PCA/DCA may be treated as basic pay for any retirement\ncomputation purposes unless, before the date of the separation on which the entitlement to\nannuity is based, the separating individual has completed at least 15 years of service as a\ngovernment physician or dentist; after this condition has been met, any amounts received as\nPCA/DCA are treated as base pay for retirement purposes, but only to the extent the amounts are\nattributable to service performed on or after December 28, 2000, and only to the extent of the\npercentage as follows: P6010.05 06/26/2014 26 Total amount of service performed\non or after 12/28/2000 as a\nGovernment physician or dentist is:\nLess than 2 years At least 2, but less than 4 years At least 4, but less than 6 years At least 6, but less than 8 years At least 8 years Allowable percentage: 0\n25\n50\n75\n100 For purposes of an annuity based upon disability, or a survivor annuity based upon the service of\nan individual who dies before separating from service, all amounts received as PCA/DCA are\ntreated as basic pay. m. Contract Implementation\n(1) Authority. The Medical Director is authorized to determine a physician\u2019s/dentist\u2019s basic\neligibility for inclusion in the PCAP/DCAP and retains authority to approve all PCA/DCA\ncontracts. (2) New PCA/DCA Contract. The contract for an allowance is negotiated with the\nphysician/dentist, then forwarded for final approval to the Medical Director through the\ninstitution\u2019s Human Resource Manager (HRM), the Warden, and the Regional Director. In\naddition to the contract, the request must include a cover letter from the Warden containing the\nfollowing:\n\u25a0 Description of the specialty required. \u25a0 Rationale and justification for the PCA/DCA as appropriate (recruitment and retention\nproblems).\n\u25a0 An analysis of the applicant\u2019s credentials.\n\u25a0",

After reviewing the request, the\nMedical Director notifies the Warden through the Regional Director of the decision. n. Renewal of PCAP/DCAP Contract. Each physician/dentist desiring to renew a contract\nneeds to notify the institution\u2019s HRM of his/her intent to renew. The HRM forwards the request,\ncover letter, and contract through the Warden and Regional Director to the Medical Director. To avoid delays in renewal agreements, applications for the Medical Director\u2019s approval must be\nsubmitted 60 days in advance of the desired effective date. The effective date cannot precede the\ndate of the Medical Director\u2019s signature. P6010.05 06/26/2014 27 The institution HRM contacts the Medical Director\u2019s office requesting approval should the\nMedical Director\u2019s approval not be received at least one pay period prior to the proposed\neffective date. Renewal of a PCAP/DCAP contract is not automatic. Any contractual, job performance, or\norganizational difficulties must be addressed prior to renewal. o. Adjustment of PCAP/DCAP Contract After 24 Months/Change in Board Certification. After a physician/dentist completes 24 months of Federal service as a physician or dentist, or\nthere is a change in Board Certification, a new PCA/DCA agreement is to be completed. The institution HRM initiates a new contract indicating the new amounts in accordance with the\nnew schedule. The Warden and the physician/dentist will date and initial these changes and send\nthe contract through the Regional Director to the Medical Director for final approval. The contract\u2019s beginning and ending dates must not change. p. Contract Effective Date. The PCA/DCA contract is effective the beginning of the first pay\nperiod after the date the Medical Director signs the contract. The Medical Director may authorize a retroactive PCA/DCA under administrative error\ncircumstances (i.e., institution/regional/Central Office staff inadvertently caused a delay in\nprocessing the PCA/DCA). q. Institution\u2019s Human Resource Manager (HRM) Responsibility. The HRM explains to\neach physician/dentist the PCA/DCA\u2019s purpose and major aspects, terms, and conditions. Upon approval of the agreement, the original agreement is forwarded to the HRM, who provides\na copy to the physician/dentist and files the original on the left-hand side of the Official\nPersonnel Folder. When a physician/dentist is separated from service while receiving a PCA/DCA, or when the\ncontract expires without renegotiation or renewal, the HRM must notify the National Finance\nCenter (NFC) and furnish a copy of the notification to the Medical Director\u2019s office. r. Assistance. Questions regarding the PCAP/DCAP may be directed to the Medical Director\u2019s\noffice. P6010.05 06/26/2014 28 18.

CPE goals in the Bureau are commensurate with quality standards of medical practice in the\ncommunity. a. Institution CPE. The HSA is responsible for the in-house CPE Program. All primary health\ncare providers will complete a minimum of 24 hours of in-house CPE per year. This can be\naccomplished through self-study magazine articles, videos, audio cassettes, etc. Employees will notify the HSA of self-study materials completed. The method of notification\nwill be determined locally. The HSA will provide adequate duty time for staff to complete inhouse CPE. Documentation of training will be placed in the employee\u2019s training record. All health care practitioners, including HSAs and AHSAs, will maintain CPR and AED\ncertification using American Red Cross or American Heart Association-established standards. The minimum level of the course should be the Basic Life Support (BLS) Heartsaver Course. There will be a written policy and procedure outlining the orientation of new health services\nstaff, in-house consultants, and other new institution staff. The orientation program will include,\nbut not be limited to:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 HSU services. Emergency procedures. HSU security procedures. Levels of care provided to the inmates.

P6010.05 06/26/2014 29 (1) The CPE Capitation Program is for health care providers, including physicians, mid-level\npractitioners, nurses, laboratory staff, HSAs, EMTs, etc. Capitation allocations may also be used\nto provide funding for external continuing education. This program is authorized for civilian/military/college continuing medical educational units. CPE Capitation funds may be used for home study/ correspondence/on-line courses from\naccredited providers. CPE capitation funds will not be distributed at the institution level. This program may not be used to obtain a degree (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4107(d)(1)). Funds may not be used for professional journals or magazines. CPE capitation funds will not be used for expenses related to obtaining professional licensure or\ncertification (e.g. application fees, exam registration fees, etc.) All funding for travel must meet Federal travel regulations. (2) CPE Residential Program. The National Continuing Professional Education Office\nannually sponsors CPE specialty education programs. These programs are based upon needs\nassessments submitted by the designated health care professionals. CPE residential programs are designed to study factors influencing the frequency and distribution\nof diseases, injuries, and other health-related events pertinent to health care in a correctional\nenvironment. All educational offerings will be based upon defined needs and explicit objectives, educational\ncontent, and methods. As required by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), the\nCentral Office CME/CPE Governing Board will review the Residential Program at least\nbiannually. These reviews are to evaluate the continuing need for the program and the sponsored\nactivities in relationship to the Health Services mission. The CME/CPE Governing Board will\nreview issues such as:\n\u25a0 Whether to add and/or delete professional disciplines.\n\u25a0 Whether to consider increasing and/or decreasing the discipline\u2019s funding level. \u25a0",

CPE capitation funding is approved on an institution need and\navailable funding basis for all health care personnel. (2) CPE Capitation Approval Process. Any health care professional who desires to attend\nCPE will request CPE approval from the HSA via a memorandum justifying attendance or\nparticipation in the educational activity. A completed Training Authorization (SF-182) and\ncourse brochure or literature must accompany the memorandum to begin the approval process. The HSA and EDM will review the requested CPE and forward the request via an SF-182 to the\nWarden for final approval. CPE may be a recruitment and retention tool that is used to maintain medical skill proficiency. Therefore, HSAs are encouraged to approve CPE requests contingent upon the following:\n\u25a0 Applicability to the profession. \u25a0 Institution HSU needs. \u25a0 Availability of CPE funds. HSAs maintain the authority to approve or deny CPE training requests. If the HSA approves the\nCPE training request, the request will be forwarded to the EDM for review and to the Warden for\nfinal approval. The required approval processing time will be established at the institution. The program/educational activity must be provided by an accredited sponsor or provider,\n(ACCME, AMA, ANA, etc.), and be approved for continuing education credit. Programs should\nbe based on required or demonstrated educational need. d. Funding Allocation\n(1) CPE Capitation Funding is based upon Central Office determinations of CPE capitation\nneeds, proper use in prior fiscal years, and the availability of funds. CPE capitation funding varies each year and notification will be sent to each institution with the\napproved funding level.

PRECEPTORSHIP PROGRAM FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS Correctional institutions may enter into agreements with educational institutions (colleges or\nuniversities) to provide students. When students and postgraduate students are present, their\nstatus will be defined in the organization\u2019s human resources policies. When students and postgraduate students are present and involved in patient evaluation, they are required to identify\nthemselves as students, and the patient must concur with examination, evaluation, or treatment\nby a student. To meet legal requirements, there are required procedures to establish a preceptorship program. The basic requirement will be an agreement on the scope of work and funding arrangements, if\napplicable, between the correctional and educational institutions. P6010.05 06/26/2014 33 HSAs are strongly encouraged to establish preceptorship programs for health care professionals\nwhere feasible, and will contact their contracting officer for details on the procurement\nregulations. At institutions with physician assistant/nurse practitioner (PA/NP) and other health professional\npreceptorship programs, the CD will monitor the student\u2019s progress and verify, in conjunction\nwith the HSA, acceptable performance to support payment of the contract charges, if applicable. BP-A0793, Physician Assistant/Nurse Practitioner Preceptorship Agreement, is a procedural\nguide and provides examples of required documents that can help establish a preceptorship\nprogram. The examples are specific to a PA/NP program, but can be modified for other health\nprofessionals. 20. AGENCY ACA ACCREDITATION PROVISIONS\nth a.
