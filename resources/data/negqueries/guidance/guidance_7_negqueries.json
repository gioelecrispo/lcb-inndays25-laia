      "content": "U.S. Department of Justice Federal Law Constraints\non Post-Election \u201cAudits\u201d\nPublished July 28, 2021 U.S. Department of Justice\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is committed to ensuring full compliance\nwith all federal laws regarding elections. This includes those provisions\nof federal law that govern the retention and preservation of election\nrecords or that prohibit intimidation of, or interference with, any\nperson\u2019s right to vote or to serve as an election of\ufb01cial. The Department is also committed to ensuring that American elections are secure and re\ufb02ect the choices\nmade on the ballots cast by eligible citizens. \u201cThe November 3rd election was the most secure in\nAmerican history,\u201d according to a Joint Statement issued by federal and state of\ufb01cials and released by\nthe federal Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency. In many jurisdictions, there were automatic\nrecounts or canvasses pursuant to state law due to the closeness of the election results. None of those\nstate law recounts produced evidence of either wrongdoing or mistakes that casts any doubt on the\noutcome of the national election results. In recent months, in a number of jurisdictions around the United States, an unusual second round of\nexaminations have been conducted or proposed. These examinations would look at certain ballots,\nelection records, and election systems used to conduct elections in 2020. These examinations,\nsometimes referred to as \u201caudits,\u201d are governed, in the \ufb01rst instance, by state law. In some\ncircumstances, the proposed examinations may comply with state law; in others, they will not. But\nregardless of the relevant state law, federal law imposes additional constraints with which every\njurisdiction must comply. This document provides information about those federal constraints, which are\nenforced by the Department of Justice. 1 | Federal Law Constraints on Post-Election \u201cAudits\u201d U.S. Department of Justice\nConstraints Imposed by the Civil Rights Act of 1960 The Civil Rights Act of 1960, now codi\ufb01ed at 52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 20701-20706, governs certain \u201c[f]ederal\nelection records.\u201d Section 301 of the Act requires state and local election of\ufb01cials to \u201cretain and\npreserve\u201d all records relating to any \u201cact requisite to voting\u201d for twenty-two months after the conduct\nof \u201cany general, special, or primary election\u201d at which citizens vote for \u201cPresident, Vice President,\npresidential elector, Member of the Senate, [or] Member of the House of Representatives,\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7\n20701. The materials covered by Section 301 extend beyond \u201cpapers\u201d to include other \u201crecords.\u201d Jurisdictions must therefore also retain and preserve records created in digital or electronic form. The ultimate purpose of the Civil Rights Act\u2019s preservation and retention requirements for federal\nelections records is to \u201csecure a more effective protection of the right to vote.\u201d State of Ala. ex rel. Gallion v. Rogers, 187 F. Supp. 848, 853 (M.D. Ala. 1960) (citing H.R. Rep. 956, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 7\n(1959)), aff\u2019d sub nom. Dinkens v. Attorney General, 285 F.2d 430 (5th Cir. 1961) (per curiam). The Act\nprotects the right to vote by ensuring that federal elections records remain available in a form that\nallows for the Department to investigate and prosecute both civil and criminal elections matters under\nfederal law.",

      "content": "Dinkens v. Attorney General, 285 F.2d 430 (5th Cir. 1961) (per curiam). The Act\nprotects the right to vote by ensuring that federal elections records remain available in a form that\nallows for the Department to investigate and prosecute both civil and criminal elections matters under\nfederal law. The Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses, Eighth Edition 2017 explains that \u201c[t]he\ndetection, investigation, and proof of election crimes \u2013 and in many instances Voting Rights Act\nviolations \u2013often depend[s] on documentation generated during the voter registration, voting,\ntabulation, and election certi\ufb01cation processes.\u201d Id. at 75. It provides that \u201call documents and records\nthat may be relevant to the detection or prosecution of federal civil rights or election crimes must be\nmaintained if the documents or records were generated in connection with an election that included\none or more federal candidates.\u201d Id. at 78. The Department interprets the Civil Rights Act to require that covered elections records \u201cbe retained\neither physically by election of\ufb01cials themselves, or under their direct administrative supervision.\u201d Federal Prosecution of Elections Offenses at 79. \u201cThis is because the document retention\nrequirements of this federal law place the retention and safekeeping duties squarely on the shoulders 2 | Federal Law Constraints on Post-Election \u201cAudits\u201d U.S. Department of Justice\nof election of\ufb01cers.\u201d Id. If a state or local election authority designates some other individual or\norganization to take custody of the election records covered by Section 301, then the Civil Rights Act\nprovides that the \u201cduty to retain and preserve any record or paper so deposited shall devolve upon such\ncustodian.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701. Therefore, if the original election of\ufb01cial who has custody of records covered by the Act hands over\nthose election records to other of\ufb01cials (for example, to legislators or other of\ufb01ceholders) or the of\ufb01cial\nturns over the records to private parties (such as companies that offer to conduct \u201cforensic\nexaminations\u201d), the Department interprets the Act to require that \u201cadministrative procedures be in\nplace giving election of\ufb01cers ultimate management authority over the retention and security of those\nelection records, including the right to physically access\u201d such records. Id. In other words, the\nobligation to retain and preserve election records remains intact regardless of who has physical\npossession of those records. Jurisdictions must ensure that if they conduct post-election ballot\nexaminations, they also continue to comply with the retention and preservation requirements of Section\n301. There are federal criminal penalties attached to willful failures to comply with the retention and\npreservation requirements of the Civil Rights Act. First, Section 301 itself makes it a federal crime for\n\u201c[a]ny of\ufb01cer of election\u201d or \u201ccustodian\u201d of election records to willfully fail to comply with the retention\nand preservation requirements. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701. Second, Section 302 provides that any \u201cperson,\nwhether or not an of\ufb01cer of election or custodian, who willfully steals, destroys, conceals, mutilates, or\nalters any record or paper\u201d covered by Section 301\u2019s retention and preservation requirement is subject\nto federal criminal penalties. Id. \u00a7 20702. Violators of either section can face \ufb01nes of up to $1000 and\nimprisonment of up to one year for each violation. Election audits are exceedingly rare.",

But the Department is concerned that some jurisdictions\nconducting them may be using, or proposing to use, procedures that risk violating the Civil Rights Act. The duty to retain and preserve election records necessarily requires that elections of\ufb01cials maintain\nthe security and integrity of those records and their attendant chain of custody, so that a complete and 3 | Federal Law Constraints on Post-Election \u201cAudits\u201d U.S. Department of Justice\nuncompromised record of federal elections can be reliably accessed and used in federal law\nenforcement matters. Where election records leave the control of elections of\ufb01cials, the systems for\nmaintaining the security, integrity and chain of custody of those records can easily be broken. Moreover,\nwhere elections records are no longer under the control of elections of\ufb01cials, this can lead to a\nsigni\ufb01cant risk of the records being lost, stolen, altered, compromised, or destroyed. This risk is\nexacerbated if the election records are given to private actors who have neither experience nor expertise\nin handling such records and who are unfamiliar with the obligations imposed by federal law. 4 | Federal Law Constraints on Post-Election \u201cAudits\u201d U.S. Department of Justice\nConstraints Imposed by the Federal Laws Prohibiting Intimidation\nFederal law prohibits intimidating voters or those attempting to vote. For example, Section 11(b) of the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965 provides that \u201cNo person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, shall\nintimidate, threaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any person for voting or\nattempting to vote, or intimidate, threaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any\nperson for urging or aiding any person to vote or attempt to vote\u2026.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10307(b). Similarly,\nSection 12 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 makes it illegal for any person, \u201cincluding an\nelection of\ufb01cial,\u201d to \u201cknowingly and willfully intimidate[], threaten[], or coerce[], or attempt to intimidate,\nthreaten, or coerce, any person for . . . registering to vote, or voting, or attempting to register or vote\u201d in\nany election for federal of\ufb01ce. Id. \u00a7 20511(1)(A). Likewise, Section 131 of the Civil Rights Act of 1957\nprovides that \u201c[n]o person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, shall intimidate, threaten,\ncoerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any other person for the purpose of interfering with\nthe right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose, or of causing such other person to vote\nfor, or not to vote for, any candidate\u201d for federal of\ufb01ce. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(b). The Attorney General is authorized to \ufb01le a civil action seeking preventative relief, including a temporary\nor permanent injunction, against any person who engages in actions that violate these statutes. See 52\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10308(d); 20510(a). And there are criminal penalties as well. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 10308(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n241, 242, 594; see generally Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses, at 33-38, 49-54, 56-58.

See, e.g., Cyber Ninjas Statement of Work \u00b6 5.1 (proposing to select three precincts\nin a large urban county to collect information from individuals through \u201ca combination of phone calls\nand physical canvassing\u201d). This sort of activity raises concerns regarding potential intimidation of voters. For example, when\nsuch investigative efforts are directed, or are perceived to be directed, at minority voters or minority\ncommunities, they can have a signi\ufb01cant intimidating effect on quali\ufb01ed voters that can deter them\nfrom seeking to vote in the future. Jurisdictions that authorize or conduct audits must ensure that\nthe way those reviews are conducted has neither the purpose nor the effect of dissuading quali\ufb01ed\ncitizens from participating in the electoral process. If they do not, the Department will act to ensure\nthat all eligible citizens feel safe in exercising their right to register and cast a ballot in future\nelections.
