      "content": "Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, and\nDisability Discrimination in Hiring This guidance explains how algorithms and artificial intelligence can lead to disability\ndiscrimination in hiring. The Department of Justice enforces disability discrimination laws with respect to state\nand local government employers. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC) enforces disability discrimination laws with respect to employers in the private\nsector and the federal government. The obligation to avoid disability discrimination in\nemployment applies to both public and private employers. How employers use algorithms and artificial\nintelligence\nEmployers, including state and local government employers, increasingly use\nhiring technologies to help them select new employees. For example, employers might use technology:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 to show job advertisements to targeted groups;\nto decide if an applicant meets job qualifications;\nto hold online video interviews of applicants;\nto use computer-based tests to measure an applicant\u2019s skills or abilities; and\nto score applicants\u2019 resumes. Many hiring technologies are software programs that use algorithms or artificial\nintelligence. An algorithm is a set of steps for a computer to accomplish a task\u2014for\nexample, searching for certain words in a group of resumes. Artificial intelligence\ngenerally means that a computer is completing a task that is usually done by a person\u2014\nfor example, recognizing facial expressions during a video interview. While these technologies may be useful tools for some employers, they may also\nresult in unlawful discrimination against certain groups of applicants, including\npeople with disabilities. 1 How the ADA protects against disability\ndiscrimination in hiring\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that seeks to remove barriers\nfor people with disabilities in everyday activities, including employment. The ADA applies to all parts of employment, including how an employer selects,\ntests, or promotes employees. An employer who chooses to use a hiring\ntechnology must ensure that its use does not cause unlawful discrimination on the\nbasis of disability. 1 The ADA bars discrimination against people with many different types of disabilities. Some examples of conditions that may be disabilities include: diabetes, cerebral palsy, deafness,\nblindness, epilepsy, mobility disabilities, intellectual disabilities, autism, and mental health\ndisabilities. A disability will affect each person differently. When designing or choosing hiring technologies, employers must consider how their tools\ncould impact different disabilities. For example, a state transportation agency that designs its hiring technology to avoid\ndiscriminating against blind applicants may still violate the ADA if its technology discriminates\nagainst applicants with autism or epilepsy. When employers\u2019 use of hiring technologies may\nviolate the ADA\nEmployers must avoid using hiring technologies in ways that discriminate against\npeople with disabilities. This includes when an employer uses another company\u2019s\ndiscriminatory hiring technologies. 2 Even where an employer does not mean to discriminate, its use of a hiring technology\nmay still lead to unlawful discrimination. For example, some hiring technologies try to\npredict who will be a good employee by comparing applicants to current successful\n1\n2 See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.4.\nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1630.4, 1630.6. 2 employees. Because people with disabilities have historically been excluded from many\njobs and may not be a part of the employer\u2019s current staff, this may result in\ndiscrimination. Employers must carefully evaluate the information used to build their\nhiring technologies.",

Because people with disabilities have historically been excluded from many\njobs and may not be a part of the employer\u2019s current staff, this may result in\ndiscrimination. Employers must carefully evaluate the information used to build their\nhiring technologies. Screening Out People with Disabilities\nEmployers also violate the ADA if their hiring technologies unfairly screen out a\nqualified individual with a disability. Employers can use qualification standards\nthat are job-related and consistent with business necessity. But employers must\nprovide requested reasonable accommodations that will allow applicants or\nemployees with disabilities to meet those standards, unless doing so would be an\nundue hardship. When designing or choosing hiring technologies to assess\nwhether applicants or employees have required skills, employers must evaluate\nwhether those technologies unlawfully screen out individuals with disabilities. 3\nEmployers should examine hiring technologies before use, and regularly when in use, to\nassess whether they screen out individuals with disabilities who can perform the\nessential functions of the job with or without required reasonable accommodations. For example, if a county government uses facial and voice analysis technologies to\nevaluate applicants\u2019 skills and abilities, people with disabilities like autism or speech\nimpairments may be screened out, even if they are qualified for the job. Some employers try to evaluate their hiring technologies to see how they impact certain\ngroups, like racial minorities. Employers seeking to do the same with respect to people\nwith disabilities must keep in mind that there are many types of disabilities and hiring\ntechnologies may impact each in a different way. 3 See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1630.4, 1630.6, 1630.9, 1630.10. 3 How to avoid disability discrimination when using\nhiring technologies\nTesting technologies must evaluate job skills, not disabilities. Some hiring technologies require an applicant to take a test that includes an algorithm,\nsuch as an online interactive game or personality assessment. Under the ADA,\nemployers must ensure that any such tests or games measure only the relevant skills\nand abilities of an applicant, rather than reflecting the applicant\u2019s impaired sensory,\nmanual, or speaking skills that the tests do not seek to measure. For example, an applicant to a school district with a vision impairment may get passed\nover for a staff assistant job because they do poorly on a computer-based test that\nrequires them to see, even though that applicant is able to do the job. If a test or technology eliminates someone because of disability when that person can\nactually do the job, an employer must instead use an accessible test that measures the\napplicant\u2019s job skills, not their disability, or make other adjustments to the hiring process\nso that a qualified person is not eliminated because of a disability. 4 In addition, employers must ensure that they do not unlawfully seek medical or\ndisability-related information or conduct medical exams through their use of hiring\ntechnologies. 5 For more information about this, see the EEOC\u2019s Enforcement Guidance:\nPreemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations. Reasonable accommodations for applicants with disabilities. The ADA requires that employers provide reasonable accommodations to individuals\nwith disabilities, including during the hiring process, unless doing so would create an\nundue hardship for the employer. 6",

Examples of accommodations include allowing use of assistive equipment, modifying policies, or\nmaking other changes to the way the hiring process or job is performed. For example, if a city government uses an online interview program that does not work with a\nblind applicant\u2019s computer screen-reader program, the government must provide a reasonable\naccommodation for the interview, such as an accessible version of the program,7 unless it would\ncreate an undue hardship for the city government. Some examples of practices that employers using hiring technologies may need to\nimplement to ensure that applicants receive needed reasonable accommodations\ninclude:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 telling applicants about the type of technology being used and how the\napplicants will be evaluated;\nproviding enough information to applicants so that they may decide whether to\nseek a reasonable accommodation; and\nproviding and implementing clear procedures for requesting reasonable\naccommodations and making sure that asking for one does not hurt the\napplicant\u2019s chance of getting the job.
