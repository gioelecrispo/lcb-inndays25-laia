The SMART Office\nwww.smart.gov\nAskSMART@usdoj.gov\n202-514-4689 Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country | 1 2 | Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country What Is SORNA? SORNA refers to the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, which is Title I of\nthe Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248). SORNA\nprovides a comprehensive set of minimum standards for sex offender registration and\nnotification in the United States. SORNA aims to close potential gaps and loopholes\nthat existed under prior law and strengthens the nationwide network of sex offender\nregistration and notification programs. Specifically, SORNA does the following:\nl l l Extends the jurisdictions in which registration is required beyond the 50 states,\nthe District of Columbia and the principal U.S. territories, to also include certain\nfederally recognized Indian tribes. Incorporates a comprehensive group of sex offenders and sex offenses for which\nregistration is required. Requires sex offenders to register and keep their registration current in each\njurisdiction where they live, work and go to school. l Requires sex offenders to provide more extensive registration information. l Establishes a three-tier framework for classifying sex offenders. l Requires sex offenders to make periodic in-person appearances to verify and\nupdate their registration information. l Expands what information is publicly available on registered sex offenders. l Changes the required minimum duration of registration for sex offenders. l Creates a new federal offense for failure to register. Duties of a SORNA Officer\nBecause SORNA implementation is complex and involves a variety of different\nrequirements, many tribal jurisdictions find it helpful to designate a point person \u2014 often\nreferred to as a SORNA Officer or SORNA Compliance Specialist \u2014 to oversee all required\ntasks. The exact title and duties of a SORNA Officer will vary from tribe to tribe. Some\nSORNA Officers are also law enforcement officers for the tribe, in which case the SORNA\nOfficer may be able to personally complete the law enforcement duties required under\nSORNA, such as fingerprinting offenders. Other SORNA Officers are civilians who carry\nout all of the non-law-enforcement functions, such as posting offender information to\nthe public registry website, and work collaboratively with a law enforcement agency\nto carry out law enforcement tasks. Regardless of whether the SORNA Officer collects\nthe information directly or has another agency perform the task, the SORNA Officer\nshould serve as a coordinator and ensure that all the information has been collected and\nentered into the tribe\u2019s registry and the required federal databases.",

Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country | 3 SORNA In-Person Registration Requirements\nSORNA requires that a registered sex\noffender periodically appear in person\nto verify and update certain registration\ninformation according to the following\nduration and frequency requirements:\nl l l Tier I offenders must appear once a year\nfor 15 years. Tier II offenders must appear once every\n6 months for 25 years. Tier III offenders must appear once\nevery 3 months for life. Sex offenders must initially register in\nperson in each jurisdiction where they\nlive, work or go to school. Further, SORNA\nrequires an in-person appearance by the\noffender when updating certain registration\ninformation, such as residence address. When Must Initial Registration\nOccur? Incarcerated sex offenders must\nbe registered before their release\nfrom imprisonment, while nonincarcerated sex offenders must be\nregistered within 3 business days\nof sentencing for the registration\noffense. If convicted, sentenced or\nincarcerated in another jurisdiction,\nregistration must take place\nwithin 3 business days of the sex\noffender establishing a residence,\nemployment or school attendance in\nyour jurisdiction. Who Must Register With a Tribal Jurisdiction? All adult sex offenders convicted of a\nregisterable sex offense must register,\nregardless of whether the offender is\na native, non-native or tribal member. There must be a conviction, not just an\narrest or accusation. Juveniles convicted\nas adults must also register, as well as\ncertain juveniles adjudicated delinquent\nof particular sex offenses. See \u201cJuvenile\nOffenders and SORNA,\u201d page 19. Offenses Involving Consensual\nSexual Conduct: \u201cRomeo &\nJuliet\u201d Exception An offense involving consensual\nsexual conduct is not a sex\noffense for purposes of SORNA\nand therefore does not require\nregistration if the victim is at least\n13 years old and the offender is\nnot more than 4 years older than\nthe victim or if the victim is an\nadult (unless the adult is under the\ncustodial authority of the offender at\nthe time of the offense). 4 | Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country Where To Register: Registration\nJurisdictional Issues\nSORNA requires that sex offenders initially\nregister in the jurisdiction of conviction. Thereafter, they must register in any\njurisdiction where they \u2014\nl live, l work, and l go to school. It is possible that a sex offender will\nhave to register in multiple registration\njurisdictions. For example, a sex offender\nwho lives in New Mexico, works in Arizona\nand goes to school in Colorado is required\nto register in all three states and keep their\nregistration current in each. Similarly, a sex\noffender who works on the Navajo Nation\nIndian Reservation and lives in Gallup,\nNew Mexico, is required to register with\nboth the Navajo Nation and the state of\nNew Mexico. If the sex offender moves to\nFlagstaff, Arizona, and continues working\non the Navajo Nation Indian Reservation,\nthey must notify the appropriate\nregistration agency in New Mexico of their\nchange in residence, notify the Navajo\nNation that they now live in Arizona, and\nregister with Arizona. A sex offender may also live, work and go\nto school exclusively in a tribal jurisdiction. If so, the offender is required to register\nonly with the tribal jurisdiction.",

See \u201cState\nDual Registration\u201d box at right for additional\nstate requirements. Tribal and State Lands\nSome tribal lands are arranged\nin a patchwork around state or\ncounty land. In such instances, a\ntribe is responsible for registration\nfunctions on lands subject to its\nlaw enforcement jurisdiction, and a\nstate is responsible for registration\nfunctions on lands subject to its law\nenforcement jurisdiction. State Dual Registration Some states go beyond SORNA\u2019s\nrequirements and require all\nsex offenders living within state\nboundaries to register with the state,\neven if they live, work or go to school\nexclusively on tribal land. Previously Registered Offenders If an offender moves out of your\njurisdiction and is no longer\nrequired to register with your tribe,\nyou may still retain that offender\u2019s\ninformation in your administrative\ndatabase or public registry website. A sex offender may have\nto register in multiple\nregistration jurisdictions. Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country | 5 Tiering\nSORNA classifies sex offense convictions into three tiers based on the nature and\nseriousness of the offense, the victim\u2019s age and the offender\u2019s prior sex offense\nconviction(s). Tier I offenses generally include only misdemeanor offenses punishable\nby no more than 1 year in jail; tier II and tier III offenses are more serious felony offenses\npunishable by more than 1 year in jail. Tribes must ensure that sex offense convictions\nare tiered correctly. The SORNA Officer or tribal prosecutor is typically responsible for\nassessing sex offense convictions and determining the appropriate tier. Tribal offenses: Tribes that have enhanced sentencing under the Tribal Law and Order Act\nmust tier tribal offenses similarly to federal or state offenses. Otherwise, tribes can opt to\ntier all tribal sex offenses as tier I offenses regardless of the nature of the offense. State offenses: State offenses should be tiered similarly to federal offenses. This includes\noffenses from Washington, D.C., and the principal U.S. territories. Military offenses: Military offenses under \u00a7 115(a)(8)(C)(i) of Public Law 105-119 should\nbe tiered similarly to federal or state offenses. For assistance with military convictions\nand obtaining supporting documentation, contact the military fellows at the U.S. Marshals\nService\u2019s National Sex Offender Targeting Center at IOD.NSOTC@usdoj.gov. Foreign offenses: Foreign offenses should be tiered similarly to federal or state offenses.

Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country | 11 Tribe and Territory Sex Offender Registry System\nThe Tribe and Territory Sex Offender\nRegistry System (TTSORS) is provided\nby the SMART Office to assist tribes and\nterritories in implementing SORNA registry\nsystem requirements. TTSORS functions\nas both the administrative registry system\nand the public sex offender registry\nwebsite, and allows offender records to be\nsubmitted directly to the FBI\u2019s National Sex\nOffender Registry (NSOR) file. Only tribal and territorial agencies that\nmanage and register sex offenders can\nenter and update information in TTSORS. The SMART Office provides TTSORS free\nof charge so that tribal jurisdictions do not\nneed to develop or purchase any special\ninformation technology systems to have\na SORNA-compliant registry system. TTSORS is hosted and managed for tribal\njurisdictions, and ongoing professional\nassistance is available by phone, email or\nchat. All that is needed to use TTSORS is a\ncomputer with internet access. Getting Started With TTSORS To get your tribe or territory started\nwith TTSORS, send a request to\nthe Institute for Intergovernmental\nResearch (IIR) at registrysupport@\nnsopw.gov or call 850-385-0600,\next. 222. NSOPW.gov The Dru Sjodin National Sex\nOffender Public Website (NSOPW.\ngov) is the only government\nsystem to link state, territory and\ntribal public sex offender registries\nfrom a national search site. Make\nsure your tribe\u2019s public website is\nlinked to NSOPW.gov. Contact IIR\nfor assistance (registrysupport@\nnsopw.gov). SORNA requirements are already included\nin TTSORS, so when a tribe participates\nin TTSORS, the tribe is automatically able to participate in NSOPW.gov and with the\nSORNA Exchange Portal. By using TTSORS, a tribe\u2019s registry system will be able to \u2014\nl Provide community notifications, l Collect all offender information required by SORNA, and l Share information with other SORNA jurisdictions. Tribes can customize the look of the public website to be unique to the jurisdiction. There are also custom offender information fields that can be tailored to collect\nadditional information as needed. Over 90% of tribes implementing\nSORNA use TTSORS as their registry\nsystem and public website. 12 | Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country Public Registry Website The SORNA Officer is typically responsible for maintaining the tribe\u2019s public sex offender\nregistry website and should ensure that the tribe\u2019s public website is immediately updated\nwith the required registration information.",

Jurisdictions must maintain fingerprints\nand palm prints in digital format in order\nto facilitate immediate access and\ntransmittal of information to various\nentities. Additionally, SORNA requires\njurisdictions to submit finger and palm\nprints to the FBI\u2019s NGI system. Use digital print-taking devices to obtain\nregistered sex offenders\u2019 fingerprints\nand palm prints, or Tribes that plan to mail digitally\nscanned or rolled, inked prints\ndirectly to CJIS may order fingerprint\ncards free of charge.

Take rolled, inked prints; scan and\nupload to the registry; and then mail the\nfingerprint cards to the FBI\u2019s Criminal\nJustice Information Services (CJIS). How To Prepare Fingerprint\nCards and Capture Palm Prints Although SORNA requires jurisdictions\nto maintain fingerprints and palm prints\nin digital format, jurisdictions are not\nrequired to use digital print-taking\ndevices (live scan) to obtain registered\nsex offenders\u2019 prints.

The FBI\u2019s CJIS Division operates\nand maintains NCIC/NSOR. Many tribal jurisdictions have agreements\nin place, such as memoranda of\nunderstanding, with various state and\nlocal law enforcement agencies in order to\naccess and submit offender information\ninto NCIC/NSOR. Some tribal jurisdictions\nhave their own access and can submit\ndirectly. Be aware that having read-only\naccess to NCIC/NSOR is insufficient: A\ntribal jurisdiction must be able to submit\nand update offender information. Tribal Access Program\nThe U.S. Department of Justice\nlaunched the Tribal Access\nProgram (TAP) to provide tribal\njurisdictions with direct access to\nfederal databases, including NCIC/\nNSOR. The SMART Office is a key\npartner and funder of TAP. For\nmore information on TAP, contact\nTribalAccess@usdoj.gov. TTSORS-NSOR Interconnection\nTribal jurisdictions using TTSORS\nand participating in TAP have\naccess to the TTSORS-NSOR\nInterconnection, an enhanced\nfeature in TTSORS that enables\nregistration information entered\ninto an offender\u2019s TTSORS record\nto be electronically submitted\ninto NCIC/NSOR. This feature\nreduces dual entry and assists in\nensuring timeliness, accuracy and\ncompleteness of an offender\u2019s NSOR\nrecord. For more information, contact\nIIR at registrysupport@nsopw.gov. If the SORNA Officer is uncertain of\nwhether the tribe has full access to NCIC/\nNSOR, contact the tribe\u2019s designated\nlaw enforcement agency. Even if there\nis an agreement in place with another\nentity to provide NCIC access, review the\nagreement to be certain that it includes\nsubmitting registered sex offender\ninformation into NSOR. An agreement for\nNCIC access may have been executed\nprior to a tribe implementing a SORNA program and therefore may not cover submitting\nregistration information. If this is the case, consider working with the tribe\u2019s legal\ncounsel to amend the agreement. For tribes participating in TAP, TTSORS users can\ndirectly submit sex offender information into NSOR TTSORS NSOR Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country | 15 DNA Collection and Submission\nSORNA requires DNA samples to be taken\nfrom sex offenders during the registration\nprocess for analysis and entry into the\nFBI\u2019s CODIS database \u2014 if DNA has not\nbeen taken and submitted previously. Some\nstates work with SORNA tribal jurisdictions\nto take, preserve and submit DNA samples\nfrom sex offenders for entry into CODIS and\nto complete the requisite follow-through\nneeded on a match between an offender and\na forensic profile (known as a \u201ccold hit\u201d). Where such cooperation and coordination\nexists, SORNA tribal jurisdictions should\ninclude memoranda of understanding or\ncooperative agreements regarding DNA\nsubmissions as part of their substantial\nimplementation submission to the\nSMART Office.

Once tribes have taken\nand submitted the DNA sample for analysis,\nit can be discarded. There is no need to retain it. How To Check if a DNA Sample\nHas Been Submitted to the FBI\nChecking an offender\u2019s DNA status\nfirst can reduce duplicate testing\nand submissions, saving time and\nresources. To find out if a DNA\nsample for a particular offender\nwas submitted to the FDDU, submit\na status request form at https://\nforms.fbi.gov/fddu-fco-samplestatus. Tribal jurisdictions participating\nin TAP can view an offender\u2019s\nDNA status via their criminal\nhistory record. Near the top of the\ncriminal history record, above the\nbiographical information, there is a\nDNA indicator showing whether a\nDNA profile already exists in CODIS. (This DNA indicator does not show\nwhether DNA has been submitted to\na state laboratory.) Note: It takes 30 days for the DNA\nindicator to be updated in the criminal\nhistory record. If the indicator is\nnegative, submit the status request\nform above to verify if a sample has\nbeen submitted to FDDU. Keep in mind that a sex offender DNA submission could result in a cold hit, and\ncooperation with other agencies \u2014 including the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, state and\nlocal law enforcement, and tribal police \u2014 may be necessary. The FBI provides DNA sample kits free of charge\nto SORNA tribal registration jurisdictions,\nwhich can be submitted directly to the FDDU. 16 | Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country Ordering Kits and Submitting DNA Samples to the FBI\nDNA kits can be ordered from the FBI\nwebsite at forms.fbi.gov/buccalcollection-kit-re-order-form.

See \u201cTribe and Territory Sex Offender\nRegistry System,\u201d page 12. ii. utilizing an email notification system, as discussed in (5) below. 3. Each jurisdiction where the sex offender is required to register. To meet this requirement, jurisdictions must ensure that there is a mechanism\nin place to transmit registration information to any other jurisdiction where an\noffender is required to register. This capacity must include the states, the principal\nterritories, the District of Columbia and every federally recognized Indian tribe that\nhas elected to operate as a SORNA registration jurisdiction. Using the SORNA\nExchange Portal will satisfy this requirement. See \u201cSORNA Exchange Portal,\u201d page\n17. 4. Any agency responsible for conducting employment-related background checks. To meet this requirement, jurisdictions must check within their own governmental\nstructure to determine \u2014\ni. which agencies conduct employment-related background checks, and\nii. how to ensure that those background checks will capture the registration\ninformation submitted by the sex offender to the registering agency. 18 | Guide to SORNA Implementation in Indian Country 5.

Juvenile Offenders and SORNA\nSORNA requires that jurisdictions register\njuveniles convicted as adults as well as\njuveniles adjudicated delinquent of certain\nserious sex offenses. A common misconception is that SORNA\nrequires jurisdictions to register all\njuveniles who are adjudicated delinquent\nfor sex offenses. In fact, SORNA requires\njuvenile registration only if the juvenile\nwas at least 14 years old at the time\nof the offense and was adjudicated\ndelinquent for committing (or attempting\nor conspiring to commit) a sexual act\n(generally speaking, a forcible penetration\noffense) with another by force, by the\nthreat of serious violence, or by rendering\nunconscious or drugging the victim. Exceptions for Juveniles\nSORNA does not require jurisdictions\nto treat their juvenile sex offenders\nthe same as adult registrants in all\nrespects. Jurisdictions have the\ndiscretion to exempt juveniles from\ntheir public sex offender website. Jurisdictions can also establish\ndifferent procedures for juveniles\nthat recognize the unique needs\nof juvenile offenders. For more\ninformation, see the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s Supplemental Guidelines\nfor Juvenile Registration (https://\nsmart.ojp.gov/sorna/currentlaw#Attorney). Because of the severity of these offenses,\njuvenile sex offenders adjudicated\ndelinquent are categorized as tier III offenders under SORNA and are subject to duration\nand in-person verification requirements applicable to all tier III offenders. Although SORNA requires registration for juveniles adjudicated delinquent of certain\nsex offenses, SORNA allows registration to be terminated after 25 years for those who\nmaintain a clean record.

If such documents are not available, the jurisdiction\nshould collect identifying information on those documents (for example, for a passport,\nthe passport number and country of issuance). Note that any information provided might\nbe communicated to foreign law enforcement officials, as deemed necessary. In addition to notifying the U.S. Marshals Service, jurisdictions may directly notify other\nappropriate law enforcement agencies of an offender\u2019s intended international travel if\ncircumstances necessitate, by whatever means the jurisdiction prefers. Failure To Appear for Registration When a tribal jurisdiction receives notice that an offender is relocating to the tribe to live,\nwork or attend school, and then the sex offender fails to appear for registration, the tribe\n(typically the SORNA Officer) must immediately inform the jurisdiction that provided the\nnotification that the sex offender failed to appear. If the tribe receives information that the offender has absconded, SORNA requires the\ntribal jurisdiction to take the following steps:\nl l Determine whether the offender has actually absconded. If no determination can be made, inform tribal police or the designated law\nenforcement agency so that they can attempt to locate the offender. If the absconded offender cannot be located, the tribal jurisdiction must do the following:\nl Update the public sex offender registry website to indicate that the offender is an\nabsconder. l Notify the U.S. Marshals Service. l Seek a warrant for the sex offender\u2019s arrest. l Update NCIC/NSOR and indicate that the offender is an absconder. l Enter the offender\u2019s information into the Wanted Person File in NCIC.
