The 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) provides funding\ndirectly to federally recognized tribal jurisdictions with established law enforcement agencies. TRGP was\ndesigned to expand the implementation of community policing and meet the most serious needs of law\nenforcement in tribal communities through a broadened comprehensive program. In Fiscal Year 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a single Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation\n(CTAS) that encompassed the department\u2019s available Tribal Government\u2013specific award programs. CTAS\nenabled each tribe to submit a single application for available award funding according to the tribes\u2019 needs.",

CTAS\nenabled each tribe to submit a single application for available award funding according to the tribes\u2019 needs. This\ncoordinated process allowed the DOJ to review a single application from a tribe, and it allowed the DOJ awardmaking components to coordinate in making award decisions to address these public safety needs on a more\ncomprehensive basis. The 2016 TRGP, which is also CTAS Purpose Area #1: Public Safety and Community Policing, consists of two types\nof awards. The TRGP-Hiring awards are for entry-level salaries and benefits for newly hired or rehired career law\nenforcement officers, and the TRGP-Equipment/Training (TRGP-E/T) awards provide funding for background\ninvestigations, training, uniforms, basic issue equipment, technology, and vehicles for tribal law enforcement\nagencies. To support community policing, particularly the development of partnerships and problem solving, 2016 TRGP\nrecipients may be offered training and technical assistance by COPS Office training and technical assistance\nproviders. Trainings will assist recipients in the advancement of community policing and may address specific\npublic safety issues facing tribal communities. The COPS Office or its technical assistance providers will notify\nTRGP recipients about training and technical assistance opportunities. Recipients are encouraged to participate\nin the training and technical assistance opportunities to further their public safety efforts. This COPS Office TRGP Award Owner\u2019s Manual will assist your agency with the administrative and financial\nmatters associated with managing your award. It was developed by the COPS Office to ensure that all TRGP\nrecipients clearly understand and meet the requirements of their award. Please review this manual carefully,\nbecause a failure to follow award requirements may result in serious penalties. Please do not hesitate to call the\nCOPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 if you need assistance with the implementation of your award.

Once you have reviewed your award\ndocument, please electronically sign it and make a copy of all pages of the document for your records, along\nwith all award condition pages, within 90 days of the date shown on the award congratulatory letter. Please see\n\u201cAccepting the award\u201d on page 65 of this manual. The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed for any\nallowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of TRGP-Hiring and TRGP-E/T awards is three years\n(36 months). TRGP-Hiring recipients are awarded three years (36 months) of funding for each position funded. Your award number is in the following format: 2016-HEWX-0000 for TRGP-E/T awards and 2016-HHWX-0000 for\nTRGP-Hiring awards funded in Fiscal Year (FY) 2016. The COPS Office tracks award information based upon this\nnumber. Therefore, it is important to have your agency\u2019s award number (or your agency\u2019s ORI number) readily\navailable when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI, the COPS Office assigns\na non-official ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two characters will be \u201cZZ\u201d). If you\nhave any questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your agency\u2019s ORI number\nwhen you contact the COPS Office. 2 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency\u2019s nine- or 13-digit\nfederal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP vendor\nnumber differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for administrative\npurposes in connection with this award program, and should not be used for IRS purposes.

The allowable costs for which your agency\u2019s award has been approved are limited to those\nlisted on the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which are included in your agency\u2019s award package. The FCM specifies the amount of TRGP Hiring funds awarded to your agency. You should carefully review your FCM,\nwhich contains the final officer salary and fringe benefit categories and amounts for which your agency was\napproved. Please note that the salary and fringe benefit costs requested in your award application may have been\nadjusted or removed. Your agency may only be reimbursed for the approved cost categories that are documented\nwithin the FCM, up to the amounts specified in the FCM.

Only actual allowable\ncosts incurred during the award period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown. If your agency experiences\nany cost savings over the course of the award (for example, your award application overestimated the total entry-level\nofficer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use that excess funding to extend the length of the\naward beyond 36 months. Any funds remaining after your agency has drawn down for the costs of approved salaries\nand fringe benefits incurred for each awarded position during the 36-month funding period for each awarded position\nwill be deobligated during the closeout process, and should not be spent by your agency. Why this condition:\nTRGP-Hiring funds may be used only to pay entry-level salaries and fringe benefits for 36 months for full time\ncareer law enforcement officers hired or rehired on or after the award start date. You may use the TRGP award to\nhire or rehire experienced officers, but award funding must be limited to paying your agency\u2019s entry-level salary\nand fringe benefits; any costs higher than entry level must be paid by your agency with local funds. TRGP-Hiring award funding may also be used to pay the approved entry-level salaries and fringe benefits of\nnewly hired officer recruits while they are in basic academy training prior to swearing them in, if it is your\nagency\u2019s standard practice to pay recruits while in training. What you should do: All recipients should keep and maintain the most recent, approved version of 2016 TRGP application, which will\ncontain the approved costs for this award. Refer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable costs. As long as\nfunds are spent during the award period on the approved salaries and benefits (as applicable), equipment,\ntechnology, training, or other costs that were documented in your application\u2019s budget summary and were\napproved through the issuance of the FCM, this award condition will be satisfied. The award number should be\nindicated on all budgetary documentation including purchase orders, receipts, and other documentation. All\nrecipients should keep and maintain the most recent, approved version of their 2016 TRGP application for future\nreference. 5 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Salaries covered by TRGP-Hiring must be based on your agency\u2019s standard entry-level salary and fringe benefits\npackage under the laws or rules that govern hiring by your agency.

Please note that the salary and benefit costs\nrequested in your original application may have been updated or corrected from the original version submitted\nto the COPS Office. Your agency may only be reimbursed for the approved cost categories and amounts that are\ndocumented within the FCM. In addition, your agency may not use TRGP funds for any costs that are not\nidentified as allowable in the FCM. Allowable costs: Indirect costs The recipient understands that indirect costs may only be requested at the time of application. A current, signed,\nfederally approved Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement or documentation showing pending request for\napproval must be included with the application. Indirect costs are costs that are incurred for common or joint purposes and are not readily assignable to a\nparticular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance of the project. Examples\nof indirect costs include those incurred for facility operation and maintenance, depreciation, and administrative\nsalaries. Indirect cost usage must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of Management and\nBudget (OMB) uniform guidance 2 CFR Part 200.56\u2014Indirect (facilities & administrative (F&A)) costs and 2 CFR\nPart 200.414\u2014Indirect (F&A) costs. Additional guidance for your entity can be found in the following locations:\nAppendix III to Part 200\u2014Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for\nInstitutions of Higher Education (IHEs); Appendix IV to Part 200\u2014Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and\nAssignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations; Appendix VII to Part 200\u2014States and Local\nGovernment and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals. Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses that are approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency carefully\ntrack and update its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office award period. The recipient understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of application,\nit will be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a current indirect cost\nrate agreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the award prohibiting the\nobligation, expenditure, or drawdown of funds reimbursement for indirect costs until a current indirect cost rate\nhas been approved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS Office. If your agency\u2019s approved indirect cost rate expires during the award period, a current approved rate must be\nsubmitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down award funding for indirect costs. In addition,\nyour agency must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect any rate change. 6 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual",

In addition, before the COPS Office officially closes out your agency\u2019s award, your agency must reconcile any\nchanges between your approved final indirect cost rate and approved provisional indirect cost rate and, if\nnecessary, repay the COPS Office for any indirect cost rate overpayment. If your agency draws down excess COPS\nOffice award funding for indirect costs, please return the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a revised\nFederal Financial Report (SF-425).

See also award condition #13 on page 15, \u201cDuplicative Funding.\u201d 4. Supplementing, Not Supplanting\nCondition:\nState, local, and tribal governments must use TRGP Hiring award funds to supplement, and not supplant, state, local,\nor BIA funds that are already committed or otherwise would have been committed for award purposes (hiring,\ntraining, purchases, and/or activities) during the award period. In other words, recipients may not use COPS Office\nfunds to supplant (replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to the COPS Office-funded item(s)\nin the absence of the COPS Office award. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds will not be used to replace\nstate or local funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made\navailable for the award purposes. Instead, TRGP award funds must be used to increase the total amount of funds\nthat would otherwise be made available for hiring or rehiring law enforcement officers. What you should do:\nTRGP-Hiring recipients may not use award funds to pay for any item or cost funded under the award\n(equipment, personnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA funds\nor committed to the recipient\u2019s budget. In addition, recipients may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from\none area within the law enforcement budget to another as a result of receiving TRGP award funds. If you have\nquestions concerning this award term and how it pertains to your project budget, please contact your COPS\nOffice Grant Program Specialist.

Each individual\nemployed under the TRGP-Hiring award must be newly hired or rehired on or after the award start date\nunless an exception is authorized in writing by the COPS Office. 7 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Any officer your agency hires brings your force not only to a number over and above the number of funded\npositions that you had on the date of your Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS), including\nfunded but vacant positions, but also to a number over and above the number of locally funded officer\npositions during the award period. During the life of your award, your agency must continue to hire as many new, locally funded officers as you\nwould have hired if you had not received your award. Your agency may not cancel or postpone spending\nmoney in its budget that is committed to hiring other new officers. Your agency must take active and timely steps to fill any vacancies that were created on or after the date of\nyour award application by retirement, resignation, or other reasons with new officers in addition to your\nTRGP-Hiring award-funded positions. Note: This award condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your\nagency under this award. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any partner agencies use COPS Office\nfunds only to supplement, not supplant, their state, local, or BIA funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 36 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated on a caseby-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted no-cost\nextensions. Reasonable justifications may include difficulties in filling COPS Office-funded positions, officer turnover,\nor other circumstances that interrupt the 36 month award funding period. An extension allows your agency to\ncompensate for such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding for each position\nawarded. Extension requests must be received prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do:",

However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days before the award end date. Requests to extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before the official award end date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will be considered only when the recipient provides\njustification of extraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance in which an unforeseen\nnatural disaster prevented a recipient from requesting an extension. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost\ntime extension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the award due to salary and fringe benefits costs that\nwere lower than anticipated, your agency may not extend the 36-month funding period for the purpose of\nexpending those excess funds.

If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time extension,\nplease contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency\u2019s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS Office\nTRGP Hiring program award. Award modifications under TRGP Hiring are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All\nmodification requests involving the purchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office\nprior to their implementation. In addition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification\nrequest that results in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Under federal regulations, you are\nrequired to expend federal funds only as approved in the FCM. Requests to change or alter an award that meet\ncertain threshold requirements must be submitted to the COPS Office for written approval, prior to their\npurchase or implementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it\nwas originally outlined and accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered\nwithin the original scope of the award. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs\n(e.g., construction) will not be approved. What you should do: For all modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link in the\nupper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office, providing the proposed changes, details\nof why the change is needed, etc.",

If applicable, your\nagency is required to sign and submit the modified award document via the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link to officially\naccept the award modification. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the TRGP Hiring award. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may\nbe carried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may be improved, and\n9 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which\nyour agency implements its TRGP award. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or evaluators may study the\neffectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the\nprograms\u2019 effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask\nquestions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel about\ncommunity policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other communities\nand police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits\nand information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information\nabout your award activities. You should fully comply with any requests regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be responsible\nfor submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the reporting period\nand quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is used to track your\nagency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness\nof increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding.",

In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress\nof our programs and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with TRGP\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d portion of the COPS Office website at\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard\nForm 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days\nafter the end of the award period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during\nthe funding period, and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date,\nhowever you will have a 90-day grace period after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds\nfor eligible expenditures incurred before the award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent\nprogrammatic or financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement\nfor allowable expenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to improve compliance with 10 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in section VI, \u201cReports,\u201d on page 80 of this manual. All\nreports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award\nfunds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both\naspects of award implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process\ncoordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include site\nvisits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and audit\nresolution. As a TGRP Hiring award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests for information\npertaining to your award.

What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients\u2019 compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to\nconduct site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is threefold:\ni.\nii.\niii. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions on how to prepare for\nthe review of their COPS Office awards. The site visit is generally performed over a period of one or more\ndays. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while on-site, or if\nnecessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will have an opportunity to seek customer service\nand/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 11 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an\nEOBGR conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative\nfor conducting site visit reviews in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall award monitoring strategy. The\npurpose of the EOBGR is three-fold:\ni.\nii.\niii. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Compliance reviews will be conducted for\nactive awards to address any noncompliance and/or administrative issues identified during the review. In\naddition, award recipients will receive customer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation\nof their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS component may refer a noncompliance issue\nto the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media,\ncitizens, law enforcement agencies, other federal agencies, or other outside sources.",

This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office\nstaff or the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or nonviolation based upon the supporting documentation and/or other factors used to make a determination for\ncompliance or non-compliance.

In the event\nyour agency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance and/or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with\nyour agency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may\ninclude repayment of award funds and/or providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance\nand/or providing proof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the causes\nfor the noncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand/or ANCRs.

Federal Civil Rights Laws\nCondition: As a condition of receipt of federal financial assistance, you acknowledge and agree that you will not (and will require\nany subrecipients, contractors, successors, transferees, and assignees not to), on the grounds of race, color, religion,\nnational origin (which includes providing limited English proficient persons meaningful access to your programs), sex,\ndisability, or age, unlawfully exclude any person from participation in, deny the benefits of or employment to any\nperson, or subject any person to discrimination in connection with any programs or activities funded in whole or in\npart with federal funds. These civil rights requirements are found in the nondiscrimination provisions of Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d); the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as\namended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3789d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794); the Age\nDiscrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. \u00a76101, et seq.); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1681, et seq.); and the corresponding DOJ regulations implementing those statutes at 28 C.F.R.

Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that established the COPS Office, that\n\u201cthe full and equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal\njustice system is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act\u2019s program to reduce crime and delinquency in\nthe United States\u201d 28 CFR \u00a7 42.301. The Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) does not impose quotas or\nhiring requirements on recipients of federal funds. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private business and has received a single award for $500,000 or\nmore and has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but excluding political\nappointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report and submit it to the OCR for review within 90 days from\nthe start date of the award. For assistance in developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click Complying with the EEOP Requirement. If your organization is a government agency or private business and the largest single award it has received is\n$25,000 or more but less than $500,000, and it has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time\nemployees but excluding political appointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report, but it need not submit\nthe report to the OCR for review. Instead, your organization must certify that it is exempt from the submission\nrequirement, that it maintains the Utilization Report on file, and that it will make the Utilization Report available\nfor review on request. For assistance in developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click Complying with the EEOP Requirement. If your organization has fewer than fifty employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the EEOP\nrequirement.",

Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and\nsub-award information, and the award term provides guidance to report the related information as required by\nFFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and\nsystems in place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements\nshould it receive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required to report award\ninformation on any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to report information on\nthe names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the recipient and first-tier\nsubrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the website at www.fsrs.gov, is the\nreporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward information and any executive\ncompensation data required by FFATA. The subaward information entered in FSRS will then be displayed on\nwww.USASpending.gov associated with your agency\u2019s award, furthering federal spending transparency. For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting requirements, please\nsee Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register,\nwww.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-09-14/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 17. Debarment and Suspension\nCondition: The recipient agrees not to award federal funds under this program to any party which is debarred or suspended from\nparticipation in Federal assistance programs. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, recipients are required to ensure that federal funds are not given to parties that are\ndebarred or suspended from participation in federal assistance programs. This is to protect the public interest\nand to ensure proper management and integrity in federal activities by conducting business only with\nresponsible parties. For details regarding the debarment and suspension requirements, please see 2 CFR Part\n180 (Government-wide Debarment and Suspension), and 2 CFR Part 2867 (DOJ-specific requirements.) What you should do: If under a COPS Office award you enter into a contract for goods or services for $25,000 or more or any\nsubaward, you must verify that the vendor or subrecipient and their respective principals (e.g., owners, top\nmanagers) with whom you intend to do business are not excluded or disqualified from participation in federal\nassistance programs.",

Recipients that have Federal contract, award, and\ncooperative agreement awards with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 must disclose\nsemiannually any information about the criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings. Definitions For purposes of this award term and condition:\na. Administrative proceeding means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order\nto make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission\nAdministrative proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals proceedings, and Armed 27 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual b. c. Services Board of Contract Appeals proceedings). This includes proceedings at the Federal and\nState level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or award. It does not\ninclude audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. Conviction, for purposes of this award term and condition, means a judgment or conviction of\na criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or a\nplea, and includes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere. Total value of currently active awards, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts\nincludes\u2014 (1) Only the Federal share of the funding under any Federal award with a recipient cost share\nor match; and\n(2) The value of all expected funding increments under a Federal award and options, even if\nnot yet exercised. Why this condition:\nUnder 2 CFR \u00a7 200.210 (b) (1) (iii), recipients of awards in excess of $500,000 are required to report certain civil,\ncriminal, and administrative proceedings if they have active federal grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts\n(or any combination of these) that total more than $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period.

Nothing in this requirement\nlimits the use of funds necessary for any federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any other entity\ncarrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities.

This does not limit the use of funds for criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication\nactivities. 26. Community Policing\nCondition:\nCommunity policing activities to be initiated or enhanced by your agency were identified and described in your award\napplication. All equipment, technology, training, and/or sworn officer positions awarded under the TRGP Hiring award\nmust be linked to the implementation or enhancement of community policing. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office defines community policing as a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that\nsupport the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the\nimmediate conditions giving rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. TRGPHiring awards must be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities. All newly hired, additional, or\nrehired officers (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) funded under TRGP-Hiring must engage in\ncommunity policing activities. While the COPS Office recognizes that your COPS Office-funded officer(s) (or an\nequal number of redeployed veteran officers) will participate in some or all aspects of your identified community\npolicing plan and advance your agency\u2019s community policing activities over the life of the award, we also\nencourage your agency to move toward an organization-wide philosophy and commitment to community\npolicing. COPS Office awards are designed to increase community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This is\nachieved through problem-solving tactics and community policing partnerships. It enhances police\nprofessionalism by providing officers with the skills and motivation to act in innovative ways to solve community\ncrime-related problems. Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure that it is initiating or\nenhancing community policing in accordance with your proposed plan, and that the officers hired (or an equal\nnumber of redeployed veteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance your agency\u2019s community\npolicing activities over the life of the award.",

What you should do: The community policing activities designated for implementation or enhancement by your agency were\nidentified in your TRGP application. Your community policing needs may change during the life of your award,\nand minor changes to this plan may be made without prior approval of the COPS Office. If your agency\u2019s\ncommunity policing plan changes significantly you must submit those changes in writing to the COPS Office for\napproval. Changes are significant if they deviate from the range of possible community policing activities\nidentified and approved in the original community policing plan submitted with your application. 29 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual 27. Retention\nCondition: At the time of award application, your agency committed to retaining all sworn officer positions funded under the\nTRGP-Hiring award with state and/or local funds for a minimum of 12 months following the conclusion of 36 months\nof federal funding for each position, over and above the number of locally-funded sworn officer positions that would\nhave existed in the absence of the award. Your agency cannot satisfy the retention requirement by using TRGP-Hiringfunded positions to fill locally-funded vacancies resulting from attrition. Why this condition: The retention requirement ensures that the increased officer staffing level under the TRGP-Hiring award\ncontinues with state or local funds for a minimum of 12 months after federal funding ends. What you should do: At the time of the TRGP application, your agency was required to affirm that it planned to retain all sworn officer\npositions awarded under the TRGP-Hiring award and identify the planned source(s) of retention funding. Your\nagency committed to retaining each awarded position for at least 12 months following the conclusion of 36\nmonths of federal funding for that position. The retention period begins for an awarded officer position once\nthat position has completed the 36-month implementation period. If an agency is awarded several officer\npositions, the retention period for each individual officer position begins upon completion of 36 months of\nfunding for that position (not based on the cumulative award end date). The retained TRGP funded position(s) must be added to your agency\u2019s law enforcement budget with state or\nlocal funds at the conclusion of grant funding, over and above the number of locally funded sworn officer\npositions that would have existed in the absence of the award. Absorbing TRGP-funded positions through\nattrition (rather than adding the extra positions to your budget with additional funding) does not meet the\nretention requirement. Your agency should maintain documentation demonstrating when the 36-month award funding period expires\nfor each awarded position and that each retained position is above and beyond the number of officer positions\nthat your agency would otherwise have funded with state or local funds. We understand that your agency\u2019s\nidentified source(s) of retention funding may change during the life of the award, so your agency should\nmaintain documentation of any changes in the event of an audit, monitoring, or other evaluation of your award\ncompliance.",

If a position funded by the TRGP-Hiring award\nbecomes vacant during the retention period, your agency is required to take active and timely steps consistent\nwith your agency\u2019s hiring policies and procedures to fill the position with a new officer to complete the\nremainder of the 12-month retention period. Your agency should maintain documentation demonstrating that\nyou did not delay filling the position and that the steps your agency took to fill the position were consistent with\nyour hiring policies and procedures. 30 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual At the conclusion of federal funding, agencies that fail to retain the sworn officer positions awarded under the\nTRGP-Hiring award may be ineligible to receive future COPS Office awards for a period of three years. If your\nagency is unable to retain any of the awarded officer positions, you should contact your COPS Office Grant\nProgram Specialist for further review. 28. Contracts with Other Jurisdictions\nCondition:\nSworn law enforcement officer positions awarded must be used for law enforcement activities or services that benefit\nyour agency and the population that it serves. The items funded under the TRGP-Hiring award cannot be utilized by\nother agencies unless the items benefit the population that your agency serves. Your agency may use items funded\nunder the TRGP-Hiring award to assist other law enforcement agencies under a resource sharing, mutual aid, or other\nagreement to address multi-jurisdictional issues as described in the agreement. Why this condition: The TRGP was created under a Congressional appropriation specifically designated for tribal law enforcement\nagencies to improve public safety in Indian communities. The TRGP-Hiring award funding is intended to benefit\nthe communities within the recipient\u2019s primary law enforcement jurisdiction. Therefore, the recipient must use\nTRGP award funding to benefit its own population. What you should do: Your law enforcement agency should avoid any agreements with other jurisdictions to share officer positions or\nother awarded equipment, technology, or vehicles unless the agreement complies with the requirement that\nCOPS Office-funded items must benefit the recipient service population. For example, if your jurisdiction has a\ntribal police department and a BIA department, items funded under the award might be able to be used by the\nBIA department as long as this would result in a benefit to the population that you serve. You may not, however,\nallow officers, equipment, technology, or vehicles funded under the award to be used by any agency or\ntransferred to any agency that does not benefit the population that you serve. For example, you may not, during\nthe award term, loan two of your awarded computers to a neighboring county\u2019s sheriff\u2019s department.",

Officers funded under TRGP-Hiring may not provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies unless\nthey will directly benefit the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, your agency may not use an officer funded\nunder TRGP-Hiring to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but your agency may\nuse the officer to provide direct law enforcement services to the population within your agency\u2019s own\njurisdiction. If your agency has an agreement with another law enforcement agency for resource sharing, mutual\naid, etc. TRGP-Hiring officers may respond to requests for assistance and participate in multi-jurisdictional\nactivities as described in the agreement. Before you enter into any agreement with another law enforcement agency, you should contact your COPS\nOffice Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770 for additional guidance. 31 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual 29. Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using TRGP funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with operating\nprinciples of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. The recipient acknowledges that it has completed, signed, and submitted the Reviews\nand Certifications form with its award application certifying compliance with 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found at 28 CFR Part 23. An\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system which receives, stores, analyzes,\nand exchanges or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 CFR Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems that protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use TRGP award funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms\nof technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 CFR Part 23 does not\napply to this award. What you should do:\nAll COPS Office award recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence\nSystems/28 CFR Part 23 as part of their award acceptance so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to\nuse their award funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use\naward funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should indicate this on the\nCriminal Intelligence Systems 28 CFR Part 23 Compliance form that was included with your award package and\ncertify and submit this form along with your signed award document as your agency\u2019s agreement to comply\nwith the operating principles found at 28 CFR Part 23. Your agency must now comply with 28 CFR Part 23 in\noperating the interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system funded through your COPS Office award. 32 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Review of award conditions\u2014Equipment/Training awards",

Assurances and Certifications\nCondition: The recipient acknowledges its agreement to comply with the Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed as\npart of its TRGP Equipment/Training application. Why this condition:\nAlthough the COPS Office has made every effort to simplify the process of applying for and receiving awards,\nseveral provisions of federal law require us to seek your Assurances and Certification regarding certain matters. Most of the Assurances and Certifications apply to all federal award programs. What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS Office award programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at the\ntime of application. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have read, understood, and\naccepted the award terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications. Your agency is required\nto keep Assurances and Certifications forms that were signed as part of its award application. Please read these\ndocuments carefully, because signatures on these documents are treated as a material representation of fact\n33 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual upon which reliance will be placed when the U.S. Department of Justice determines whether to fund the\ncovered award.

Allowable Costs\nCondition: The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs to meet the most serious needs of law enforcement\nin tribal communities. The allowable costs for which your agency\u2019s award has been approved are limited to those\nlisted on the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which is included in your agency\u2019s award package. The FCM\nspecifies the exact items that your agency is allowed to fund with your TRGP Equipment/Training award and specifies\nthe overall amount approved for each budget request category. Your agency may not use TRGP Equipment/Training\naward funds for any costs that are not identified as allowable in the FCM. Why this condition:\nTRGP-Equipment/Training may only be used for the purchase of equipment, technology, training, uniforms, and\nother items approved by the COPS Office as reflected in the FCM. The COPS Office TRGP funds the purchase of\nitems that have a link to the implementation or enhancement of community policing initiatives in your agency. TRGP-Equipment/Training funds may only be used to pay for items and services approved by the COPS Office as\nreflected in the FCM. To be eligible for payment under this award, the purchase of approved items must be\nmade on or after the award start date and comply with the guidelines described in section III, \u201cAccessing Award\nFunds,\u201d on page 70 of this manual. Section IV, \u201cFinancial Record Maintenance,\u201d on page 74, outlines the types of\nrecords you must keep to document that you followed this award condition. Purchases must also reflect the\ncosts that were approved in the FCM. What you should do: All recipients should keep and maintain the most recent, approved version of 2016 TRGP application, which will\ncontain the approved costs for this award. Refer to your FCM for the list of approved allowable costs. Listed\nbelow are the budget categories that may appear on your FCM.

Basic law enforcement training is encouraged for existing police\nofficers who have not received it, depending on the needs of your department and the availability of funding. Award funding may only be used for one cycle of basic training per officer. The recipient agency will be\nresponsible for any additional costs associated with an officer not completing basic training on the first attempt. TRGP funds may also pay for community policing and problem-solving training; specialized law enforcement\ntraining in such topics as counterterrorism, family violence, and crime prevention and detection; and training\nrelated to Indian Country jurisdictional issues. Only requests for training by recognized training providers such as\nthe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, the FBI, the BIA Indian Police Academy, a state police academy,\nCOPS Office Regional Community Policing Institutes, or a tribal community college will be considered. In\naddition, funding may be used to attend training conferences such as the National Native American Law\nEnforcement Association\u2019s annual training conference or any COPS Office-sponsored conference. Funding for community policing or other law enforcement training will cover only travel, lodging, and per diem\nexpenses for each representative to and from the training site (if training is conducted more than 50 miles from\nyour agency headquarters). State academy training costs include training instruction fees, academy tuition,\ncourse fees, textbooks, manuals, supplies, and travel in connection with the training (transportation, lodging, per\ndiem, etc.) if the training is located more than 50 miles from the job site. If your state academy does not charge\nfor the training, your department will be reimbursed only for travel in connection with the training. Departments\nthat send officers to the BIA Indian Police Academy will be reimbursed for travel costs only, as there is no cost for\ntuition at the BIA Indian Police Academy for tribal officers. TRGP-E/T funds may pay for computer training for systems, hardware, or software that recipients already own\nbut may not be utilizing to the fullest extent due to of a lack of training. Applicants must demonstrate that the\ntraining enhances law enforcement activities, particularly in support of community policing. TRGP-E/T funding\nmay be used only for training costs not already funded in the applicant\u2019s budget with state, local, or BIA funds. In addition, TRGP-E/T funding may be used for off-site training required to increase tribal capacity to operate a\ncrime information gathering system compatible with the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting System.

A current, signed,\nfederally approved Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement or documentation showing pending request for\napproval must be included with the application. Indirect costs are costs that are incurred for common or joint purposes and are not readily assignable to a\nparticular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance of the project. Examples\nof indirect costs include those incurred for facility operation and maintenance, depreciation, and administrative\nsalaries. Indirect cost usage must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of Management and\nBudget (OMB) uniform guidance 2 CFR Part 200.56\u2014Indirect (facilities & administrative (F&A)) costs and 2 CFR\nPart 200.414\u2014Indirect (F&A) costs.

Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses that are approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency carefully\ntrack and update its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office award period. 37 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual The recipient understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of application,\nit will be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a current indirect cost\nrate agreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the award prohibiting the\nobligation, expenditure, or drawdown of funds reimbursement for indirect costs until a current indirect cost rate\nhas been approved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS Office. If your agency\u2019s approved indirect cost rate expires during the award period, a current approved rate must be\nsubmitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down award funding for indirect costs. In addition,\nyour agency must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect any rate change. If your agency has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, then you may request up to a flat 10 percent de\nminimis indirect cost rate applied to the modified total direct costs (MTDC). In addition, before the COPS Office officially closes out your agency\u2019s award, your agency must reconcile any\nchanges between your approved final indirect cost rate and approved provisional indirect cost rate and, if\nnecessary, repay the COPS Office for any indirect cost rate overpayment. If your agency draws down excess COPS\nOffice award funding for indirect costs, please return the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a revised\nFederal Financial Report (SF-425).

For example, recipients who have budgeted funds\nto pay for new computer equipment may not reallocate those funds to pay for any other law enforcement cost\nas a result of receiving TRGP-E/T award funds for the same computer equipment. TRGP Equipment and Training\u2014To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 \u2022 Equipment and technology must be purchased on or after the award start date (unless an exception is\nauthorized in writing by the COPS Office) in addition to purchases that the recipient has obligated funding\nin the current budget to make. Funds currently allocated to purchase equipment or technology may not be\nreallocated to other purposes or reimbursed upon the receipt of a TRGP-E/T award. For example, recipients\nwho have budgeted local funds to pay for a new computer system may not reallocate those funds to pay for\nany other law enforcement cost as a result of receiving TRGP-E/T funds for the same computer system.",

Any training covered by TRGP-E/T funds is in addition to the number of hours of training already provided\nby your agency. Funds currently allocated for training may not be reallocated to other purposes. Note: This award condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your\nagency under this award. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any partner agencies use COPS Office\nfunds only to supplement, not supplant, their state, local, or BIA funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 36 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 36 months will be evaluated on a caseby-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted no-cost\nextensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays, or other\ncircumstances that interrupt the 36 month award funding period. An extension allows your agency to compensate for\nsuch delays by providing additional time to complete the full 36 months of funding. Extension requests must be\nreceived prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. 39 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the award end date. Requests\nto extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before the official award end date. Extension\nrequests received after the expiration date will be considered only when the recipient provides justification of\nextraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance in which an unforeseen natural disaster\nprevented a recipient from requesting an extension. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension by\nthe end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency\u2019s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS Office\nTRGP Equipment/Training award. Award modifications under TRGP Equipment/Training are evaluated on a case-bycase basis. All modification requests involving the purchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the\nCOPS Office prior to their implementation.",

In addition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any\nmodification request that results in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may expend award funds\nonly as approved in the FCM. Any requests to change or alter awards require written approval from the COPS\nOffice prior to their implementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your\naward as it was originally awarded and accepted by your agency. Please be advised that reprogramming\nrequests for unallowable costs (e.g., construction) will not be approved. What you should do: For all modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link in the\nupper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office, providing the proposed changes, details\nof why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific award modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified award may begin\nfollowing written approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for active awards will\noften be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes.

Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the TRGP Equipment/Training award. The recipient agrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may\nbe carried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may be improved, and\nwhy certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which\nyour agency implements its TRGP award. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or evaluators may study the\neffectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the\nprograms\u2019 effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask\nquestions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel about\ncommunity policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other communities\nand police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information.",

You will be asked to facilitate any site visits\nand information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information\nabout your award activities. You should fully comply with any requests regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be responsible\nfor submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the reporting period\nand quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is used to track your\nagency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness\nof increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government must be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress\nof our programs and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with TRGP\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d portion of the COPS Office website at\n41 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard\nForm 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days\nafter the end of the award period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during\nthe funding period, and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date,\nhowever you will have a 90-day grace period after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds\nfor eligible expenditures incurred before the award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent\nprogrammatic or financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement\nfor allowable expenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to improve compliance with\nreporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in section VI, \u201cReports,\u201d on page 80 of this manual. All\nreports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award\nfunds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities.",

Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both\naspects of award implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process\ncoordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include site\nvisits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and audit\nresolution. As a TGRP Equipment/Training award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests\nfor information pertaining to your award. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain\na monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are complying with COPS Office\naward requirements. In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance\nto help ensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients\u2019 compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\nSite visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to\nconduct site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is threefold: 1. i.\nii.\niii. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies To provide customer service and technical assistance 42 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions on how to prepare for\nthe review of their COPS Office awards. The site visit is generally performed over a period of one or more\ndays. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while on-site, or if\nnecessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will have an opportunity to seek customer service\nand/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an\nEOBGR conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative\nfor conducting site visit reviews in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall award monitoring strategy. The\npurpose of the EOBGR is three-fold: 2. i.\nii.\niii. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies To provide customer service and technical assistance",

This\nreview is generally performed over a one to two day period. Compliance reviews will be conducted for\nactive awards to address any noncompliance and/or administrative issues identified during the review. In\naddition, award recipients will also receive customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS component may refer a noncompliance issue\nto the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media,\ncitizens, law enforcement agencies, other federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case\nbasis, COPS ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate\ncomplaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office\nstaff or the OIG. Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or non-violation based upon the supporting\ndocumentation and/or other factors used to make a determination for compliance or non-compliance. Audit liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event\nyour agency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance and/or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with\nyour agency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may\ninclude repayment of award funds and/or providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance\nand/or providing proof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the causes\nfor the noncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award\nfunds, or a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time. Under certain conditions,\nadditional actions may include referral and placement on the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s High Risk List, which\nwill include mandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training and being 43 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual subject to increased monitoring of current and future awards while on the list.",

Federal Civil Rights Laws\nCondition: As a condition of receipt of federal financial assistance, you acknowledge and agree that you will not (and will require\nany subrecipients, contractors, successors, transferees, and assignees not to), on the grounds of race, color, religion,\nnational origin (which includes providing limited English proficient persons meaningful access to your programs), sex,\ndisability, or age, unlawfully exclude any person from participation in, deny the benefits of or employment to any\nperson, or subject any person to discrimination in connection with any programs or activities funded in whole or in\npart with federal funds. These civil rights requirements are found in the nondiscrimination provisions of Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d); the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as\namended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3789d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794); the Age\nDiscrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. \u00a76101, et seq.); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1681, et seq.); and the corresponding DOJ regulations implementing those statutes at 28 C.F.R. Part 42\n(subparts C, D, E, G, and I). You also agree to comply with Executive Order 13279, as amended by Executive Order\n13559, and the implementing regulations at 28 C.F.R Part 38 Partnerships With Faith-Based and Other Neighborhood\nOrganizations, which requires equal treatment of religious organizations in the funding process and\nnondiscrimination of beneficiaries by faith-based organizations on the basis of belief or nonbelief. Why this condition: In establishing financial assistance programs, Congress linked the receipt of federal funding to compliance with\nfederal civil rights laws. As a result, recipients are required to comply with the civil rights requirements found in\nthe nondiscrimination provisions referenced above. A hold may be placed on your award if it is deemed that\nyour agency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an ongoing federal civil\nrights investigation.",

Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP)\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the development\nand implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that established the COPS Office, that\n\u201cthe full and equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal\njustice system is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act\u2019s program to reduce crime and delinquency in\nthe United States\u201d 28 CFR \u00a7 42.301. The Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) does not impose quotas or\nhiring requirements on recipients of federal funds. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private business and has received a single award for $500,000 or\nmore and has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but excluding political\nappointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report and submit it to the OCR for review within 90 days from\nthe start date of the award.

False Statements\nCondition:\nFalse statements or claims made in connection with COPS Office awards may result in fines, imprisonment, or\ndebarment from participating in federal awards or contracts, and/or any other remedy available by law. Why this condition: This condition advises recipients of the consequences of submitting false claims or statements on applications,\nfinancial and programmatic reports, or other award documents. What you should do:\nEnsure that all documentation related to your agency\u2019s receipt and use of award funding (award applications,\nprogress reports, Federal Financial Reports, etc.) is true and accurate. 13. Duplicative Funding\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees to notify the COPS Office if it receives, from any other source, funding for the\nsame item or service also funded under this award. Why this condition: This award was provided to your agency to address its law enforcement needs that are not funded with other\nfunds, including federal, state, local, tribal, or BIA funds. Consequently, your agency may not use this funding for\nitems or services that you already have funding for from other sources. What you should do: If your agency receives funding from another source for the same item(s) or services(s) also funded under this\naward, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. If necessary, the COPS Office\nwill work with your agency to reprogram funding for items or services that are allowable under this award\nprogram. 14.

Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and\nsub-award information and the award term provides guidance to report the related information, as required by\nFFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and\nsystems in place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements\nshould it receive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required to report award\ninformation on any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to report information on\nthe names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the recipient and first-tier\nsubrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the website at www.fsrs.gov, is the\nreporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward information and any executive\ncompensation data required by FFATA. The subaward information entered in FSRS will then be displayed on\nwww.USASpending.gov associated with your agency\u2019s award, furthering federal spending transparency. For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting requirements, please\nsee Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register,\nwww.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-09-14/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 17. Debarment and Suspension\nCondition: The recipient agrees not to award federal funds under this program to any party which is debarred or suspended from\nparticipation in Federal assistance programs. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, recipients are required to ensure that federal funds are not given to parties that are\ndebarred or suspended from participation in federal assistance programs. This is to protect the public interest\nand to ensure proper management and integrity in federal activities by conducting business only with\nresponsible parties. For details regarding the debarment and suspension requirements, please see 2 CFR Part\n180 (Government-wide Debarment and Suspension), and 2 CFR Part 2867 (DOJ-specific requirements.) What you should do: If, under a COPS Office award, you enter into a contract for goods or services for $25,000 or more or any\nsubaward, you must verify that the vendor or subrecipient and their respective principals (e.g., owners, top\nmanagers) with whom you intend to do business are not excluded or disqualified from participation in federal\nassistance programs.",

Definitions For purposes of this award term and condition:\na. b. c. Administrative proceeding means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order\nto make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission\nAdministrative proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals proceedings, and Armed\nServices Board of Contract Appeals proceedings). This includes proceedings at the Federal and\nState level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or award. It does not\ninclude audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. Conviction, for purposes of this award term and condition, means a judgment or conviction of\na criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or a\nplea, and includes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere. Total value of currently active awards, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts\nincludes\u2014 (1) Only the Federal share of the funding under any Federal award with a recipient cost share\nor match; and\n(2) The value of all expected funding increments under a Federal award and options, even if\nnot yet exercised. Why this condition:\nUnder 2 CFR \u00a7 200.210 (b) (1) (iii), recipients of awards in excess of $500,000 are required to report certain civil,\ncriminal, and administrative proceedings if they have active federal grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts\n(or any combination of these) that total more than $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period. The\npurpose is to protect the public interest and to ensure proper management in federal activities by conducting\nbusiness with responsible parties. What you should do: If the total value of your active grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts from all federal awarding agencies\nexceeds $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period, then you must ensure that the proceedings\ndescribed in paragraph 2 of this award term that are reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) are\ncurrent. The information about the reported proceedings is made available in SAM via the designated integrity\nand performance system (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System\n(FAPIIS)). During the award period, you must either report for the most recent five year period new information\nabout any proceeding(s) that you have not reported previously or affirm that there is no new information to\nreport.",

Travel Costs\nCondition:\nTravel costs for transportation, lodging and subsistence, and related items are allowable under the TRGP\nEquipment/Training Program with prior approval from the COPS Office. Payment for allowable travel costs will be in\naccordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.474 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for\nFederal Awards) as adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 2800.101. Why this condition:\nTRGP-E/T will fund award-related travel costs for the recipient agency or other (nonrecipient) individuals to\nattend training and technical assistance conferences, seminars, or classes or to visit a site specified in the original\napplication. Allowable expenses for award-related lodging, meals, and incidental expenses that were included in\nthe application were approved by the COPS Office as part of your agency\u2019s TRGP-E/T award and final budget. For\nmore information, please refer to award condition #3 on page 34, \u201cAllowable Costs.\u201d What you should do: Your agency should refer to your FCM for a list of approved travel costs and use TRGP-E/T funds only for those\napproved travel costs incurred during the award period. In addition, your agency should keep timely and\naccurate records of all travel expenses. If at any time these costs change, you should immediately contact your\nCOPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 27. Contracts with Other Jurisdictions\nCondition:\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, and civilian positions awarded must be used for law enforcement activities\nor services that benefit your agency and the population that it serves. The items funded under the TRGP\nEquipment/Training award cannot be utilized by other agencies unless the items benefit the population that your\nagency serves. Your agency may use items funded under the TRGP Equipment/Training award to assist other law\nenforcement agencies under a resource sharing, mutual aid, or other agreement to address multi-jurisdictional issues\nas described in the agreement. 60",

The TRGP-E/T award funding is intended to benefit the\ncommunities within the recipient\u2019s primary law enforcement jurisdiction. Therefore, the recipient must use TRGP\naward funding to benefit its own population. What you should do: Your law enforcement agency should avoid any agreements with other jurisdictions to share officer positions or\nother awarded equipment, technology, or vehicles, unless the agreement complies with the requirement that\nCOPS Office-funded items must benefit the recipient service population. For example, if your jurisdiction has\nboth a tribal police department and a BIA department, items funded under the award might be able to be used\nby the BIA department as long as this would result in a benefit to the population that you serve. You may not,\nhowever, allow officers, equipment, technology, or vehicles funded under the award to be utilized by any\nagency or transferred to any agency that does not benefit the population that you serve. For example, you may\nnot, during the award term, loan two of your awarded computers to a neighboring county\u2019s sheriff\u2019s\ndepartment. If your agency has an agreement with another law enforcement agency for resource sharing,\nmutual aid, etc. TRGP-E/T funded items may be used to answer requests for assistance and assist in multijurisdictional activities as described in the agreement. Before you enter into any agreement with another law enforcement agency, you should contact your COPS\nGrant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770 for additional guidance. 28. Sole Source Justification\nCondition:\nTRGP Equipment/Training recipients who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group of\nitems) or service in excess of $150,000 and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement\nprocess must provide a written sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating, expending,\nor drawing down award funds for that item or service. Why this condition: In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in\nsome instances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: An award recipient must request written approval from the COPS Office for sole source procurements in excess\nof $150,000 prior to purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract; or\nentering into a contract with award funds. For the purchase of equipment, technology, or services under a COPS\nOffice award, recipients must use their own documented procurement procedures that reflect applicable state\nand local laws and regulations, as long as those requirements conform to the federal procurement requirements\nset forth in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.320 as adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 CFR \u00a7 2800.101.",

Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using TRGP Equipment/Training funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must\ncomply with operating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. The recipient acknowledges that it has completed, signed, and\nsubmitted the Reviews and Certifications form with its award application certifying compliance with 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found at 28 CFR Part 23. An\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system which receives, stores, analyzes,\nand exchanges or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 CFR Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems that protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use TRGP award funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms\nof technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 CFR Part 23 does not\napply to this award. What you should do:\nAll COPS Office award recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence\nSystems/28 CFR Part 23 as part of their award acceptance so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to\nuse their award funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use\naward funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should indicate this on the\nCriminal Intelligence Systems 28 CFR Part 23 Compliance form that was included with your award package and\ncertify and submit this form along with your signed award document as your agency\u2019s agreement to comply\nwith the operating principles found at 28 CFR Part 23. Your agency must now comply with 28 CFR Part 23 in\noperating the interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system funded through your COPS Office award. 63 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual 31.

All equipment, technology, training, and/or sworn officer positions awarded under the TRGP award must\nbe linked to the implementation or enhancement of community policing. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office defines community policing as a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that\nsupport the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the\nimmediate conditions giving rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. TRGPE/T awards must be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities. All newly hired, additional, or\nrehired officers (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) funded under TRGP-E/T must engage in\ncommunity policing activities. While the COPS Office recognizes that your COPS Office-funded officer(s) (or an\nequal number of redeployed veteran officers) will participate in some or all aspects of your identified community\npolicing plan and advance your agency\u2019s community policing activities over the life of the award, we also\nencourage your agency to move toward an organization-wide philosophy and commitment to community\npolicing. COPS Office awards are designed to increase community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This is\nachieved through problem-solving tactics and community policing partnerships. It enhances police\nprofessionalism by providing officers with the skills and motivation to act in innovative ways to solve community\ncrime-related problems. Your organization may be monitored or audited to ensure that it is initiating or\nenhancing community policing in accordance with your proposed plan, and that the officers hired (or an equal\nnumber of redeployed veteran officers) are used to implement this plan and advance your agency\u2019s community\npolicing activities over the life of the grant. The COPS Office may also use this information to understand the\nneeds of the field, and potentially provide for training, technical assistance, problem solving, and community\npolicing implementation tools. What you should do: The community policing activities designated for implementation or enhancement by your agency were\nidentified in your award application. Your community policing needs may change during the life of your award,\nand minor changes to this plan may be made without prior approval of the COPS Office. If your agency\u2019s\ncommunity policing plan changes significantly you must submit those changes in writing to the COPS Office for\napproval.

For assistance with financial management and award administration, please contact the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one payment system available for accessing federal award funds\u2014the Grant Payment Request\nSystem (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables grantees to use a secure Internet connection to request\nfunds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States\nDepartment of the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the\nprimary system that agencies use for EFT. A recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made\nsince July 2009. For more information regarding GPRS, please go to\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view the user guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a new GPRS account? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s) will\nbe responsible for requesting federal funds for your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The\nindividual(s) selected must click on the following link and register with the GPRS system to become a drawdown\nspecialist for your agency: https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome. Once you have been approved, you will receive an e-mail containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement\nexecutive and/or government executive or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process.",

This form can be found on the\nCOPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf. Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 Your agency must complete the \u201cPayee/Company Information\u201d section following the directions on the back of\nthe form and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial institution\nmust complete the \u201cFinancial Institution Information\u201d section and have the appropriate financial official sign the\nform. If you are already a COPS Office award recipient, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long as\nyour OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment\nform information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Staff Accountant. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you are\nrequired to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFRs) using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able to\nmake drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the\nCOPS Office by the deadline date. Recipients are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see section V1 of this\nmanual, titled \u201cReports,\u201d on page 80. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS.

However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. 71 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the recipient\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4. is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\nmaintains excess cash on hand;\ndoes not adhere to the terms and conditions of the award;\nfails to submit reliable or timely reports. How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements; however, your reimbursement\nrequests should cover a specific time frame and include only costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM). As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once. Can we earn interest on our award funds? For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified\nat 31 CFR Part 205 \u2018\u2018Rules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers\u2019\u2019 and TFM 4A\u20132000\nOverall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies. For non-federal entities other than states, payment methods must minimize the time between your drawdown\nof federal funds and your payment of award costs to avoid earning excess interest on your award funds. You\nmust account for interest earned on advances of federal funds as follows:\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance at 2 CFR \u00a7 200.305(b)(9) states that interest\nearned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year may be\nretained by the non-federal entity for administrative expenses. Any interest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts that is in excess\nof $500 per year must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment\nManagement System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nnetwork or a Fedwire Funds Service payment.

These records must include both\nfederal funds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for\nthe funds awarded. As required by 2 CFR 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your accounting\nsystem should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the following\nobjectives for federal awards:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your TRGP award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your TRGP award (including payroll, time\nand attendance records, canceled checks, and purchases order) must be retained for a period of three\nyears from the date of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 CFR \u00a7200.333 (Retention\nrequirements for records). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever\nyou find more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving these records has\nbeen started before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action.",

Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The two primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving\nfederal financial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 CFR Part 200\u2014\nUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform\nGuidance) on December 26, 2013. This new guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments\nawarded on or after December 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of\nSAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7200.514 Scope of audit except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987 to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit\nis to express opinions on the recipient\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations.",

Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the OIG for award audits? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits\nare designed to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on\nan annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances,\nhowever, the OIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the\ngeographical distribution of awards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and\nexpired), and type of award (hiring and non-hiring).",

Reports As part of the TRGP, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report TRGP funding\nseparately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal awards) to ensure accurate\nfinancial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial\ninternal controls in place to monitor the use of TRGP funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the award\nterms and conditions. Good practices in this area include written accounting practices, an accounting system\nthat tracks all drawdowns and award expenditures, and the ability to track when each TRGP position is filled or\nvacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit complete reports, or submit them\nin a timely manner, may result in the suspension and possible termination of your agency\u2019s COPS Office award\nfunding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within\n30 days after the end of each calendar quarter.

Community policing defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of\npartnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to\npublic safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1.\n2.\n3. Community partnerships\nOrganizational transformation\nProblem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the individuals\nand organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages\ninteractive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through\ncollaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and\naddressing public safety problems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific goals at\ntown hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the community,\nand team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncommon interests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups,\nadvocacy groups, community development corporations, and the faith community. 95 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because\nthey often bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help\nidentify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and\ncommunity outreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating\ninformation about police-business partnerships and initiatives, and crime prevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community\nagencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced.",

In addition, the media can have a significant impact on\npublic perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how\nthe infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages\nthe application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the\nentire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem\nsolving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and\ncommunication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of doing business. 96 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part\nof the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor\ngroups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing\nimplementation. Decision making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision-making. Decentralized\ndecision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision\nmaking involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving\nefforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate\nvarious resources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the\ncommunity will help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise.",

If a strategic plan is to\nhave value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their\nefforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and values statement should be\nsimple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of\nprocedures, where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime\nrates) community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include greater community\nsatisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality of life. Community\npolicing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks not only at measured outcomes,\nbut also at how feedback information is used. Transparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the\ncommunity is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant information on\ncrime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. 97 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local patrol officers have decisionmaking authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term assignments,\nthe development of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or\nareas. Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components can help enhance customer service\nand facilitate more contact between police and citizens, thus establishing strong relationships and mutual\naccountability. Patrol beat boundaries should be aligned to neighborhood boundaries to enhance officers\u2019\nunderstanding of communities within their patrol areas and to build trust within the community. Other\ncommunity policing partners should become familiar with both the patrol officers and community policing\nofficers assigned within each patrol beat to coordinate government and nongovernment community policing\nactivities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, the culture of policing should strive to have officers have to be able to\nhandle multiple responsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with\nthe community. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just by special units, although\nthere may be a need for specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly complex\nproblems or managing complex partnerships.

Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency\nincluding recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from sworn officers to\ncivilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be aligned with the agencies\u2019\ncommunity policing values. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment,\nselection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving\nresponsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service, not just a spirit of\nadventure. A community policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it looks for recruits, whom it is\nrecruiting and hiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community involvement in\nthis process through the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. 98 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Personnel supervision/evaluations\nSupervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are\nincorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional procedures should support sound\nproblem-solving activities, proactive policing, community collaboration, and citizen satisfaction with police\nservices. Training\nTraining at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles and tactics. It\nalso needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to identify\nand correct conditions that could lead to crime, raise public awareness, and engage the community in finding\nsolutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving\nand help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized\nwithin the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information technology systems\nCommunity policing is highly information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in providing ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their patrol beat. In\naddition, technological enhancements can greatly assist with accessing information to provide vital resources,\nimproving two-way communication with citizens, and developing agency accountability systems and\nperformance outcome measures. Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the public\nand internally within their organization. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages\nagencies to develop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports; reverse\n911; e-mail alerts; Internet social media discussion forums; and feedback on interactive applications (such as\nsurveys and geographical information), thereby creating open, ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency.

Community policing also encourages the use of technology to develop accountability\nand performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a broad array of\nmeasures and information.

In addition, technology can support crime/problem analysis\nfunctions by enabling agencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime locations,\nand quality-of-life concerns, and to further enhance analysis. 99 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual SAFECOM guidance\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Emergency Communications, in coordination with various\nstakeholder groups, develops the annual SAFECOM Guidance on Emergency Communications Grants. The\nguidance provides recommendations to award recipients seeking funding for interoperable emergency\ncommunications projects, including allowable costs, items to consider when funding emergency\ncommunications projects, awards management best practices for emergency communications awards, and\ninformation on standards that ensure greater interoperability. The guidance is intended to ensure that federally\nfunded investments are compatible and support national goals and objectives for improving interoperability\nnationwide. Recipients (including sub-recipients) that are using CPD funds to support emergency\ncommunications activities should comply with the latest version of SAFECOM Guidance, including provisions on\ntechnical standards that ensure and enhance interoperable communications. The most recent version of\nSAFECOM guidance is available at www.safecomprogram.gov/grant/Default.aspx. Quality and accuracy of data\nInformation is only as good as its source; therefore, it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information from various\nsources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked to one another and\nchecked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance\nmeasurement. Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must\nbe infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think\ninnovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses.

An inclusive list of stakeholders for the\nselected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents\nsimilar in one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of\nbehavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with\ninput from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. 100 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding\nof the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish\ncorrelation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to\nfind out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?, when?, where?,\nhow?, why?, and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem. The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem or reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but\nalso gathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process,\noutcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis\nshould be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and\ntested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear, meaning that additional scanning,\nanalysis, or responses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for example,\ncapable guardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders (e.g.,\nparents, friends, and probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees, and\nmotel clerks).",

At present, an\nofficer may select a garment that corresponds to an appropriate threat level and be\nconfident that armor in compliance with NIJ\u2019s standard will defeat the stated threat\nlevel.\u201d Type I (.22 LR; .38 Special) Type I body armor is light. This is the minimum level of protection every officer should have, and the armor\nshould be routinely worn at all times while on duty. Type I body armor was the armor issued during the NIJ\ndemonstration project in the mid-1970s. Most agencies today, however, because of increasing threats, opt for a\nhigher level of protection. This armor protects against .22 long rifle high-velocity lead bullets, with nominal masses of 2.6 g (40 gr),\nimpacting at a velocity of 320 m/s (1,050 ft/s) or less, and against .38 special round-nose lead bullets, with\nnominal masses of 10.2 g (158 gr), impacting at a velocity of 259 m/s (850 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection\nagainst most other .25 and .32 caliber handgun rounds. Type II-A (lower velocity .357 Magnum; 9mm)\nType II-A body armor is well suited for full-time use by police departments, particularly those seeking protection\nfor their officers from lower velocity .357 Magnum and 9mm ammunition. This armor protects against .357 Magnum jacketed soft-point bullets, with nominal masses of 10.2 g (158 gr),\nimpacting at a velocity of 381 m/s (1,250 ft/s) or less, and against 9mm full-metal jacketed bullets, with nominal\nmasses of 8.0 g (124 gr), impacting at a velocity of 332 m/s (1,175 ft/s).

It also protects against most other factory loads in caliber .357 Magnum and\n9mm as well as the Type I and II-A threats. Type III-A (.44 Magnum; submachine gun 9mm) Type III-A body armor provides the highest level of protection currently available from concealable body armor\nand is generally suitable for routine wear in many situations. However, departments located in hot, humid\nclimates may need to evaluate the use of Type III-A armor carefully. This armor protects against .44 Magnum lead semi-wadcutter bullets with gas checks, nominal masses of 15.55 g\n(240 gr), impacting at a velocity of 426 m/s (1,400 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against most handgun\nthreats as well as the Type I, II-A, and II threats. Type III (high-powered rifle) Type III body armor is clearly intended only for tactical situations when the threat warrants such protection, such\nas barricade confrontations involving sporting rifles. This armor, normally of hard or semi-rigid construction, protects against 7.62 mm full-metal jacketed bullets (U.S.\nmilitary designation M80), with nominal masses of 9.7 g (150 gr), impacting at a velocity of 838 m/s (2,750 ft/s) or\nless. It also provides protection against threats such as 223 Remington (5.56 mm FMJ), 30 Carbine FMJ, and 12gauge rifled slug, as well as the Type I through III-A threats. Type IV (armor-piercing rifle) Type IV body armor provides the highest level of protection currently available. Because this armor is intended\nto resist armor piercing bullets, it often uses ceramic materials. Such materials are brittle in nature and may\nprovide only single-shot protection, since the ceramic tends to break up when struck. As with Type III armor,\nType IV armor is clearly intended only for tactical situations when the threats warrant such protection. This armor protects against .30-06 caliber armor-piercing bullets (U.S. military designation AMP2), with nominal\nmasses of 10.8 g (166 gr), impacting at a velocity of 868 m/s (2,850 ft/s) or less. It also provides at least single-hit\nprotection against the Type I through III threats. Special type\nA purchaser who has a special requirement for a level of protection other than one of the above standard threat\nlevels should specify the exact test rounds and minimum impact velocities to be used and indicate that this\nstandard shall govern in all other respects. 103 2016 COPS Office Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Appendix E.
