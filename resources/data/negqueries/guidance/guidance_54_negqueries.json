The COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program awards\nprovide funding to advance the practice of community policing in law enforcement agencies through\neducational resource products and services such as training and technical assistance, the development of\ninnovative community policing strategies, applied research, guidebooks, and best practice documents. According to the COPS Office, community policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that\nsupport the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the\nimmediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime.",

For a\ncomplete definition, please see appendix C, \u201cCommunity policing defined,\u201d on page 74. This CPD Award Owner\u2019s Manual will assist your agency with the administrative and financial matters associated\nwith your award. It was developed to ensure that all CPD award recipients are able to clearly understand and\nmeet the requirements of their award. Please review this manual carefully because failure to follow award\nrequirements can have serious ramifications. Please do not hesitate to call your COPS Office Program Manager as\nlisted in your agency\u2019s award package or the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 if you need\nassistance with the implementation of your award. When your agency applied for CPD funding, your agency was required to certify compliance with all applicable\nfederal laws. In that regard, members of Congress have asked the Department of Justice to examine whether\njurisdictions with \u201csanctuary policies\u201d (i.e., policies that either prevent law enforcement from releasing persons\nwithout lawful immigration status into federal custody for deportation or policies that prevent state or local law\nenforcement from sharing certain information with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials), are in\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. section 1373. For that reason, all recipients for this program should understand that if the\nCOPS Office receives information which indicates that a recipient may be in violation of 8 U.S.C. section 1373 (or\nany other applicable federal law) that recipient may be referred to the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG)\nfor investigation. If the recipient is found to be in violation of an applicable federal law by the OIG, the recipient\nmay be subject to criminal and civil penalties, in addition to relevant DOJ programmatic penalties including\nsuspension or termination of funds, inclusion on the high risk list, repayment of funds, or suspension and\ndebarment. Thank you for providing us with the opportunity to work in partnership with you on this important project. 1 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual I.

The award document The award document is the document indicating your official award funding amount, the award number, the\naward terms and conditions, and the award start and end dates. Please note that if your award includes a\ncooperative agreement, it is incorporated by reference into the award document and that by signing the award\ndocument, your agency has entered into the cooperative agreement with the COPS Office and agrees to abide\nby all the requirements in the cooperative agreement. The award document is preprinted with your agency\u2019s law enforcement and government executives\u2019 names and\naddresses. For non-law enforcement agencies (institutions of higher education, private organizations, etc.), the\nauthorized officials are the programmatic and financial officials who have the ultimate signatory authority to\nsign contracts on behalf of your organization. If this information is incorrect or has changed, please update your\n\u201cAgency Contacts\u201d online at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link.

Be sure to\nfamiliarize yourself with all terms, conditions, and requirements of your award before signing the award\ndocument. To officially accept your award, please electronically sign the award document within 90 days of the\ndate shown on the award congratulatory letter. Print and retain a copy of all pages of the award document,\naward terms and conditions, the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), and, if applicable, the cooperative\nagreement and the award document supplement for your records. The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed for any\nallowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your CPD award is listed on your award document. Your award number is in the following format: 2016-XX-XX-XXXX for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 awards. The COPS\nOffice tracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency\u2019s award\nnumber (or your agency\u2019s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI, the COPS Office assigns 2 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual a non-official ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two characters will be \u201cZZ\u201d). If you\nhave any questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your agency\u2019s ORI number\nwhen corresponding with the COPS Office.",

The CPD program will fund award-related travel costs for the recipient agency or other (nonrecipient) individuals\nto attend training and technical assistance conferences, seminars, or classes or to visit a site specified in the\napplication. Allowable award-related travel costs that were included in the application have been approved by\nthe COPS Office as part of the CPD award and final budget. Your agency should keep timely and accurate records\nof all travel expenses. If at any time these costs change, you should immediately contact your COPS Office\nProgram Manager. Contracts/Consultants\nCompensation for individual consultant services procured under a COPS Office award must be reasonable,\nallocable in accordance with 2 C.F.R. Subpart E\u2014Cost Principles, and consistent with rates paid for similar\nservices in the marketplace. Unless otherwise approved by the COPS Office, consultant rates will be based on the\nsalary a consultant receives from his or her primary employer, as applicable, up to $650 per day. For consultant\nor contractor rates which exceed $650 per day, the COPS Office requires written justification if the consultants or\ncontractors are hired through a noncompetitive bidding process, and recipients must receive COPS Office\napproval of those rates before drawing down award funds. Determinations of approval will be made on a caseby-case basis. Other costs\nProject-related expenditures that do not conform to any of the category descriptions specified above are\nincluded in the \u201cother costs\u201d section of your FCM. In addition, items that have a direct correlation to the overall\nsuccess of a recipient\u2019s project objectives and are necessary for the project to reach full implementation will be\nconsidered on a case-by-case basis by the COPS Office.",

For recipients that are state, local, or tribal government entities, requests may be made only for items or\npositions that are not otherwise budgeted with state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds and would not\nbe funded in the absence of the CPD award. If at any time you are unsure if an item is considered allowable or unallowable, please contact your COPS Office\nProgram Manager for further assistance. Indirect costs\nIndirect (facilities and administrative, or F&A) costs are costs incurred for a common or joint purpose that are not\nreadily assignable to a particular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance\nof the project. Indirect costs are allowable for this program, but must adhere to the standards set forth in the\napplicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance as stated in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 (Uniform 7 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards) as adopted by the\nU.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 2800.101. Examples of indirect costs include those incurred for facility\noperation and maintenance, depreciation, and administrative salaries. Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency carefully track\nand update its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office award period. The recipient understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of application,\nit will be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a current indirect cost\nrate agreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the award prohibiting the\nobligation, expenditure, or drawdown of funds for reimbursement for indirect costs until a current indirect cost\nrate has been approved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS Office. If your agency\u2019s approved indirect cost rate expires during the award period, a current approved rate must be\nsubmitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down award funding for indirect costs. Your expired\nrate must be renegotiated or extended by your cognizant federal agency. An approved indirect cost rate may be\nextended one time for up to four years, and once the cognizant federal agency has approved your extension,\nyou must abide by that rate for the agreed-upon time period. At the end of the extension period, you must\nrenegotiate a new indirect cost rate. Your agency must advise the COPS Office in writing of any changes to your\napproved indirect cost rate during the award period and must request a budget modification with the COPS\nOffice to reflect any rate change.",

Your agency must advise the COPS Office in writing of any changes to your\napproved indirect cost rate during the award period and must request a budget modification with the COPS\nOffice to reflect any rate change. If your agency has never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, then you may request a de minimis indirect\ncost rate of 10 percent of modified total direct costs (MTDC). See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.414(f). In addition, if a provisional indirect cost rate is in effect at award closeout, your agency shall proceed with\ncloseout, but you will need to complete an expenditure analysis upon receipt of the approved final indirect cost\nrate to determine if an adjustment is necessary. If your agency drew down excess COPS Office funding for\nindirect costs, then your agency must return the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a revised Federal\nFinancial Report (SF-425). If your agency incurred additional indirect costs, then your agency may request a\nbudget modification if the award is still open and award funds are available. If your agency returns or draws\ndown COPS Office funding, then your agency will need to submit a revised final Federal Financial Report (SF425). Please be advised that recipients may not use COPS Office funding for the same item or service also funded by another\nU.S. Department of Justice award. See also award condition #13 on page 16, \u201cDuplicative Funding.\u201d 4. Supplementing, Not Supplanting\nCondition:\nState, local, and tribal government recipients must use Community Policing Development funds to supplement, and\nnot supplant, state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds that are already committed or otherwise would have\nbeen committed for award purposes (hiring, training, purchases, and/or activities) during the award period. In other 8 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual words, state, local, and tribal government recipients may not use COPS Office funds to supplant (replace) state, local,\nor BIA funds that would have been dedicated to the COPS Office-funded item(s) in the absence of the COPS Office\naward. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds not be used to replace state\nor local funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made available for\nthe award purposes. What you should do: For state, local, and tribal recipients, CPD funds may not be used to pay for any item or cost funded under the\naward (equipment, personnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA\nfunds. In addition, recipients may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within the law\nenforcement budget to another as a result of receiving CPD award funds. If you have questions concerning this\naward term and how it pertains to your project budget, please contact your COPS Office Program Manager. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding.",

Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable\njustification for delays will be granted no-cost extensions. Extension requests must be received prior to the end date of\nthe award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. When justified, the COPS Office will seek to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed. Requests to extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before\nthe official award end date. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension before the award end date\nmay result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. Please note that the project period of performance will be extended, if necessary, until the deliverable is\nconsidered final. If the award is set to expire, prior to the final approval of the deliverable, a no-cost extension\nwill be executed for a reasonable amount of time for the recipient to complete the final deliverable. 9 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nAward modifications under the Community Policing Development program are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in\naccordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.308. For federal awards in excess of $150,000, any modification request involving the\nreallocation of funding between budget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of the total\napproved budget requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award amount or\nbudget modification percentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In addition,\nany budget modification that changes the scope of the project requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you are required to expend\nfederal funds only as approved in the FCM. Requests to change or alter an award that meet certain threshold\nrequirements must be submitted to the COPS Office for written approval, prior to their purchase or\nimplementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it was originally\noutlined and accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within the\noriginal scope of the award. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved.",

Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within the\noriginal scope of the award. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved. Your agency may reprogram its budget up to an aggregate (over the course of your project) of 10 percent of the\ntotal project cost without prior written approval from the COPS Office. However, you should notify your COPS\nOffice Program Manager of any reprogramming that falls below the 10 percent threshold as well. For awards in\nexcess of $150,000, any reprogramming of funds that totals an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the approved\nbudget requires prior written approval from the COPS Office.

Implementation of the modified award budget may begin following written approval\nfrom the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for active awards will be accompanied by a\nmodified FCM reflecting the approved changes. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the CPD Program. The recipient agrees to\ncooperate with the monitors and evaluators. 10 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may\nbe carried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may be improved, and\nwhy certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which\nyour agency implements its CPD award. COPS Office staff or evaluators may study the effectiveness of funded\nprograms, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the programs\u2019 effect on crime,\nvictims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask questions about the challenges\nencountered during project implementation, how residents feel about community policing, and how police feel\nabout their work. This information will be useful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your agency or department.",

You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be responsible\nfor submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the reporting period\nand quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is used to track your\nagency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness\nof increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress\nof our programs and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with CPD\nawards. All reports should be submitted to the COPS Office within the deadlines given to avoid suspension or\npossible termination of award funds or other remedial actions. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a\nfinal programmatic closeout report must be submitted directly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d\nlink of the COPS Office website at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit\nquarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each\ncalendar quarter.

Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that recipients receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be monitored to ensure\ncompliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS Office is also interested\nin tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of award\nimplementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process coordinated by the\nU.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include site visits, office-based\ngrant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and audit resolution. As a CPD\nrecipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests for information pertaining to your award. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain\na monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are complying with COPS Office\naward requirements. In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance\nto help ensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards.",

In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance\nto help ensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients\u2019 compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to\nconduct site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is threefold:\ni.\nii.\niii. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions on how to prepare for\nthe review of their COPS Office awards. The site visit is generally performed over a period of one or more\ndays. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while on-site or if\nnecessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer\nservice and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an\nEOBGR conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative\nfor conducting site visit reviews in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall award monitoring strategy. The\npurpose of the EOBGR is three-fold:\ni.\nii.\niii. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies To provide customer service and technical assistance 12 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Compliance reviews will be conducted for\nactive awards to address any noncompliance and/or administrative issues identified during the review. In\naddition, award recipients will receive customer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation\nof their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS component may refer a noncompliance issue\nto the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media,\ncitizens, law enforcement agencies, other Federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case\nbasis, COPS ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate\ncomplaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office\nstaff or the OIG.",

Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or non-violation based upon the supporting\ndocumentation and/or other factors used to make a determination for compliance or non-compliance. Audit Liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event\nyour agency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance and/or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with\nyour agency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may\ninclude repayment of award funds and/or providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance\nand/or providing proof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the causes\nfor the noncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award\nfunds, or a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time. Under certain conditions,\nadditional actions may include referral and placement on the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s High Risk List, which\nwill include mandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training and being\nsubject to increased monitoring of current and future awards while on the list. In the event of criminal misuse of\naward funds, recipients may also be subject to fines and imprisonment. To avoid findings of noncompliance,\nrecipients are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Grant\nMonitoring Standards and Guidelines and Award Owner\u2019s Manual for the year in which the award was made. Recipients should also contact their COPS Office Program Manager at any time during the life of a COPS Office\naward with questions concerning award conditions, terms, or requirements to seek guidance to avoid\nnoncompliance. It is necessary for recipients to maintain all relevant documentation (administrative, financial,\nand programmatic) used to develop the application and implement the award that may be necessary or\nrequired to demonstrate award compliance.

Federal Civil Rights Laws\nCondition: As a condition of receipt of federal financial assistance, you acknowledge and agree that you will not (and will require\nany subrecipients, contractors, successors, transferees, and assignees not to), on the grounds of race, color, religion,\nnational origin (which includes providing limited English proficient persons meaningful access to your programs), sex,\ndisability, or age, unlawfully exclude any person from participation in, deny the benefits of or employment to any\nperson, or subject any person to discrimination in connection with any programs or activities funded in whole or in\npart with federal funds. These civil rights requirements are found in the nondiscrimination provisions of Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d); the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as\namended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3789d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794); the Age\nDiscrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. \u00a76101, et seq.); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1681, et seq.); and the corresponding DOJ regulations implementing those statutes at 28 C.F.R.

You also agree to comply with Executive Order 13279, as amended by Executive Order\n13559, and the implementing regulations at 28 C.F.R Part 38 Partnerships With Faith-Based and Other Neighborhood\nOrganizations, which requires equal treatment of religious organizations in the funding process and\nnondiscrimination of beneficiaries by faith-based organizations on the basis of belief or nonbelief. Why this condition: In establishing financial assistance programs, Congress linked the receipt of federal funding to compliance with\nfederal civil rights laws. As a result, recipients are required to comply with the civil rights requirements found in\nthe nondiscrimination provisions referenced above. A hold may be placed on your award if it is deemed that\nyour agency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an ongoing federal civil\nrights investigation. If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate or draw down federal\nfunds under your agency\u2019s COPS Office award until you comply with federal civil rights laws or cooperate with\nany ongoing federal civil rights investigation. What you should do:\nIncluded with your award package is a memorandum from the Office for Civil Rights, Office of Justice Programs,\nand the U.S. Department of Justice, which addresses the federal civil rights statutes and regulations applicable to\nyour award. You should review this memorandum to understand your agency\u2019s civil rights responsibilities. As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the\napplicable federal civil rights laws and to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective enforcement\nof such laws and to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes providing access to\nrecords, accounts, documents, information, facilities, and staff. 11.

Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP)\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the development\nand implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). 14 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that funds the COPS Office, that \u201cthe full\nand equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal justice\nsystem is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act\u2019s program to reduce crime and delinquency in the\nUnited States\u201d (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.301). EEOPs do not impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private business and has received a single award for $500,000 or\nmore and has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but excluding political\nappointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report and submit it to the OCR for review within 90 days from\nthe start date of the award. For assistance in developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click Complying with the EEOP Requirement. If your organization is a government agency or private business and the largest single award it has received is\n$25,000 or more but less than $500,000, and it has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time\nemployees but excluding political appointees), then it must prepare a Utilization Report, but it need not submit\nthe report to the OCR for review. Instead, your organization must certify that it is exempt from the submission\nrequirement, that it maintains the Utilization Report on file, and that it will make the Utilization Report available\nfor review on request. For assistance in developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click Complying with the EEOP Requirement. If your organization has fewer than fifty employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the EEOP\nrequirement. To claim the exemption, however, your organization must certify that it is exempt by logging onto\nthe OCR website at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and following the Certification Form instructions. If you have further questions regarding the EEOP requirements, you may contact an EEOP specialist at the OCR\nby telephone at 202-307-0690, by TTY at 202-307-2027, or by e-mail at EEOsubmisson@usdoj.gov. 12.

Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, recipients are required to ensure that federal funds are not given to parties that are\ndebarred or suspended from participation in federal assistance programs.

For assistance with financial management and award administration, please contact the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one payment system available for accessing federal award funds\u2014the Grant Payment Request\nSystem (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables recipients to use a secure Internet connection to\nrequest funds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States\nDepartment of the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the\nprimary system that agencies use for EFT. An award recipient will be able to review previous payment requests\nmade since July 2009. For more information regarding GPRS, please go to\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view the User Guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a new GPRS account? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s) will\nbe responsible for requesting federal funds for your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The\nindividual(s) selected must click on https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome and register with the GPRS\nsystem to become a Drawdown Specialist for your agency. Once you have been approved, you will receive an e-mail containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement\nexecutive and/or government executive or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process. All individuals that need access to GPRS must register separately and\ncreate their own unique GPRS username account, as these accounts are not meant to be shared.",

If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated Clearinghouse\n(ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on the COPS Office\nwebsite at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf. Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 Your agency must complete the \u201cPayee/Company Information\u201d section following the directions on the back of\nthe form and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial institution\nmust complete the \u201cFinancial Institution Information\u201d section and have the appropriate financial official sign the\nform. If you are already a COPS Office award recipient, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long as\nyour OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment\nform information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Staff Accountant. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you are\nrequired to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFRs) using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able to\nmake drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the\nCOPS Office by the deadline date. Awardees are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at\nhttps://portal.cops.usdoj.gov/. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see section VII of this\nmanual, titled \u201cReports,\u201d on page 58. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter.

Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the recipient\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4. is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\nmaintains excess cash on hand;\ndoes not adhere to the terms and conditions of the award; and/or\nfails to submit reliable or timely reports. How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements; however, your reimbursement\nrequests should cover a specific time frame and include only costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM). As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once. Can we earn interest on our award funds? For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified at 31\nCFR Part 205 \u2018\u2018Rules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers\u2019\u2019 and TFM 4A\u20132000 Overall\nDisbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies. For nonfederal entities other than states, payment methods must minimize the time between your drawdown of\nfederal funds and your payment of award costs to avoid earning excess interest on your award funds. You must\naccount for interest earned on advances of federal funds as follows:\n\u2022 \u2022 The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance at 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.305(b)(9) states that\ninterest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year\nmay be retained by the nonfederal entity for administrative expenses. Any interest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts that is in excess\nof $500 per year must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment\nManagement System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nnetwork or a Fedwire Funds Service payment.

Financial Record Maintenance Under the COPS Office CPD Program, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems and\nfinancial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include both\nfederal funds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for\nthe funds awarded. As required by 2 CFR. \u00a7 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your\naccounting system should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the\nfollowing objectives for federal awards:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your CPD award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your CPD award (including payroll, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, and purchase order) must be retained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 CFR \u00a7200.333 (Retention requirements for\nrecords). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever\nyou find more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving these records has\nbeen started before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These records should be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage.",

If your agency has more than one COPS Office award or an award from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization from the\nCOPS Office, or in the case of an award from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your accounting\nsystems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the\nComptroller General of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may\naccess these records for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 54 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual VI. Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The two primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving\nfederal financial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 CFR Part 200\u2014\nUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform\nGuidance) on December 26, 2013. This new guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments\nawarded on or after December 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of\nSAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7200.514 (Scope of audit) except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit\nis to express opinions on the recipient\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations.",

Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the OIG for award audits? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits\nare designed to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on\nan annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances,\nhowever, the OIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the\ngeographical distribution of awards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and\nexpired), and type of award (hiring and non-hiring).",

This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office so that you can successfully complete a\ndrawdown of funds through GPRS. Awardees who do not submit SF-425s by the due date each quarter will be unable to draw down award funds\nuntil the report has been successfully submitted. The payment system contains a function which checks for SF425 delinquency and will reject a drawdown attempt if the SF-425 is not up to date. Subsequent e-mail, fax,\nand/or hard copy reminders may be sent to the awardee if the SF-425 is delinquent. For general information concerning online filing of SF-425 reports, go to https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov or\ncontact the COPS Office Response Center by phone at 800-421-6770 or by e-mail at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov.",

In\naddition, once you have completed your final drawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of\nfunds drawn down by your agency. When should all of the award monies be spent?

In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period following award\nexpiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess award funds remaining in your account following the award\nperiod due to an overestimate of item costs during the award period. Your agency should review its records\ncarefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred during\nthe award period.

Community policing defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of\npartnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to\npublic safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1.\n2.\n3. Community partnerships\nOrganizational transformation\nProblem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the individuals\nand organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages\ninteractive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through\ncollaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and\naddressing public safety problems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools.",

Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific goals at\ntown hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the community,\nand team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncommon interests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups,\nadvocacy groups, community development corporations, and the faith community. 74 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because\nthey often bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help\nidentify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and\ncommunity outreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating\ninformation about police-business partnerships and initiatives, and crime prevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community\nagencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on\npublic perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how\nthe infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages\nthe application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the\nentire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem\nsolving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and\ncommunication that take place within agencies to support this orientation.",

Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and\ncommunication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of doing business. 75 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part\nof the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor\ngroups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing\nimplementation. Decision making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision-making. Decentralized\ndecision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision\nmaking involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving\nefforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate\nvarious resources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the\ncommunity will help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan is to\nhave value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their\nefforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and values statement should be\nsimple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of\nprocedures, where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime\nrates) community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include greater community\nsatisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality of life. Community\npolicing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks not only at measured outcomes,\nbut also at how feedback information is used. Transparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the\ncommunity is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant information on\ncrime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. 76",

This can be achieved through long-term assignments,\nthe development of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or\nareas. Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components can help enhance customer service\nand facilitate more contact between police and citizens, thus establishing strong relationships and mutual\naccountability. Patrol beat boundaries should be aligned to neighborhood boundaries to enhance officers\u2019\nunderstanding of communities within their patrol areas and to build trust within the community. Other\ncommunity policing partners should become familiar with both the patrol officers and community policing\nofficers assigned within each patrol beat to coordinate government and nongovernment community policing\nactivities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, the culture of policing should strive to have officers have to be able to\nhandle multiple responsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with\nthe community. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just by special units, although\nthere may be a need for specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly complex\nproblems or managing complex partnerships. Resources (time, finances, and people) Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources and the investment of time to support\ncommunity policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained and\neffective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency\nincluding recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from sworn officers to\ncivilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be aligned with the agencies\u2019\ncommunity policing values. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment,\nselection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving\nresponsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service, not just a spirit of\nadventure.

Training\nTraining at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles and tactics. It\nalso needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to identify\nand correct conditions that could lead to crime, raise public awareness, and engage the community in finding\nsolutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving\nand help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized\nwithin the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information technology systems\nCommunity policing is highly information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in providing ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their patrol beat. In\naddition, technological enhancements can greatly assist with accessing information to provide vital resources,\nimproving two-way communication with citizens, and developing agency accountability systems and\nperformance outcome measures. Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the public\nand internally within their organization. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages\nagencies to develop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports; reverse\n911; e-mail alerts; Internet social media discussion forums; and feedback on interactive applications (such as\nsurveys and geographical information), thereby creating open, ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters, e-mail and\nenhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other entities for\nmore efficient operations. Community policing also encourages the use of technology to develop accountability\nand performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a broad array of\nmeasures and information. Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely\ninformation on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers in their\npatrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem analysis\nfunctions by enabling agencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime locations,\nand quality-of-life concerns, and to further enhance analysis. 78 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual SAFECOM guidance\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Emergency Communications, in coordination with various\nstakeholder groups, develops the annual SAFECOM Guidance on Emergency Communications Grants.

Recipients (including sub-recipients) that are using CPD funds to support emergency\ncommunications activities should comply with the latest version of SAFECOM Guidance, including provisions on\ntechnical standards that ensure and enhance interoperable communications. The most recent version of\nSAFECOM guidance is available at www.safecomprogram.gov/grant/Default.aspx. Quality and accuracy of data\nInformation is only as good as its source; therefore, it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information from various\nsources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked to one another and\nchecked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance\nmeasurement. Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must\nbe infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think\ninnovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A\nmajor conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way\nis the SARA (scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the\nscope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the\nselected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents\nsimilar in one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of\nbehavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with\ninput from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. 79 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding\nof the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish\ncorrelation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to\nfind out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?, when?, where?,\nhow?, why?, and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited.",

Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem. The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem or reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but\nalso gathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process,\noutcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis\nshould be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and\ntested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear, meaning that additional scanning,\nanalysis, or responses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for example,\ncapable guardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders (e.g.,\nparents, friends, and probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees, and\nmotel clerks). Rather than focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the police focus on the\nfactors that are within their reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing\nguardianship, and associating risk with unwanted behavior. 80 2016 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Appendix D.

Unless otherwise approved by the COPS Office, approved consultant rates will be based on the salary a\nconsultant receives from his or her primary employer, as applicable, up to $650 per day. If individuals receive\nfringe benefits from their primary employer, such fringe benefit costs should not be included in the calculation\nof consultant rates. For consultant or contractor rates which exceed $650 per day, the COPS Office requires\nwritten justification if the consultants or contractors are hired through a noncompetitive bidding process. The\nrecipient agency must provide justification for any such rate in excess of $650 per day and receive COPS Office\napproval of that rate before drawing down award funds. Any jurisdiction that does not provide sufficient written\njustification will be limited to $650 per day for each consultant or contractor. Please note that this does not\nmean that the rate can or should be $650 for all consultants. Note: Consultant and contractor daily rates do not include travel or subsistence, but may include preparation,\nevaluation, and travel time. Guidance for requesting a consultant rate based on employment\nConsultants associated with educational institutions (including state-run educational institutions). If\nrepresenting an academic institution, the maximum rate of compensation that will be allowed is the consultant\u2019s\nacademic salary projected for 12 months, divided by 260. These individuals normally receive fringe benefits that\ninclude sick leave for a full 12-month period, even though they may only work nine months per year in their\nacademic positions. This does not apply to individuals providing consultant work outside of their academic\ncommitments. In such cases, the rate of compensation will be based on reasonable cost principles and requires\ndocumentation supporting the requested rate. Consultants employed by state and local government. Compensation for these consultants will be allowed\nonly when the unit of government will not provide these services without cost. If a state or local government\nemployee is providing services under a federal award and is representing his or her agency without pay from its\nrespective unit of government, the rate of compensation is not to exceed the daily salary rate for the employee\npaid by the unit of government. If the state or local government employee is providing services under a federal\naward and is not representing his or her agency, the rate of compensation is based on the necessary and\nreasonable cost principles.
