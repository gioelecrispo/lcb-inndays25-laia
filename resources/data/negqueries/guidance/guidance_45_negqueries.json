Background and Overview\nPurpose of the PREA Auditor Handbook The purpose of the PREA Auditor Handbook (Handbook) is to articulate the Department of\nJustice\u2019s (DOJ\u2019s) expectations for all DOJ-certified PREA auditors, establish requirements for\nauditor conduct and audit methodology, provide transparency to all stakeholders regarding the\nexpected audit methodology, and serve as an easy-to-use reference guide for conducting high\nquality, objective, comprehensive, and reliable PREA audits. The Handbook covers the\nfollowing core topics:\nIMPORTANT\n\u2022 Auditing contracts and compensation\n\u2022 Code of conduct governing auditors\nPREA auditors are required to\nread this Handbook and should\n\u2022 Conflicts of interest\nrefer to it often in the course of\n\u2022 Process for becoming a DOJ-certified PREA auditor\ntheir work.

Failure to\n\u2022 The PREA Management Office\u2019s oversight of the\nfollow the requirements in the\nHandbook will result in\nPREA audit function\ndisciplinary review (see Chapter\n\u2022 Auditor recertification process and disciplinary\n23) by the PREA Management\naction by the PREA Management Office\nOffice, which may impact an\n\u2022 Auditor resources\nauditor\u2019s DOJ certification. Although the Handbook contains much of the essential\ninformation that auditors need to know, it is a living document that will need to be updated and\nadapted over time to meet the evolving needs of DOJ, PREA auditors, and the field. If auditors have questions about the PREA audit process, the role of an auditor, auditor\ncertification requirements, or any issues that are not covered in the Handbook, they should\nrefer to the frequently asked questions (FAQs) issued by the DOJ PREA Working Group, which\nare updated regularly on the PREA Resource Center website (see\nwww.prearesourcecenter.org/frequently-asked-questions).",

About PREA and the Standards\nThe Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601 et seq.), created to\nprotect individuals from sexual abuse and sexual harassment in confinement facilities, was\npassed in 2003 with unanimous support from both parties in Congress. In addition to providing\nfederal funding for research on sexual abuse in confinement facilities, a demonstration grant\nprogram for state, local, and tribal jurisdictions to establish \u201czero tolerance\u201d cultures for sexual\nabuse and sexual harassment in confinement, and the provision of training and technical\n1 assistance, PREA mandated the development of national standards to achieve the goals set\nforth under the statute. The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission (Commission) was created by PREA and\ncharged with developing recommended national standards for reducing sexual abuse in\nconfinement. A report containing the recommended national standards was published in June\n2009 and conveyed to DOJ. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15606(e)). After extensive public comment periods and\nsubsequent revisions, DOJ published the final PREA Standards (Standards) in the Federal\nRegister on June 20, 2012 (see www.prearesourcecenter.org/sites/default/files/library/201212427.pdf). The Standards became effective on August 20, 2012 and apply to adult prisons and\njails, juvenile facilities, lockups, and community confinement facilities. The first 3-year audit\ncycle began a year later on August 20, 2013. DOJ PREA Working Group The DOJ PREA Working Group was first established by the Attorney General to review the\nCommission\u2019s recommended standards and issue final standards \u201cbased upon the independent\njudgment of the Attorney General.\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15607(a)(2)). The DOJ PREA Working Group\u2019s current mission is to provide guidance to auditors, agencies,\nand facilities on how to interpret the Standards. This guidance is issued in the form of FAQs that\nare posted on the PREA Resource Center website (see\nwww.prearesourcecenter.org/frequently-asked-questions). The DOJ PREA Working Group\u2019s active\nPREA FAQs and the Audit\nmembers include representatives from the\nfollowing DOJ components: Office of Justice The FAQs issued by the DOJ PREA Working Group\nconstitute interpretive guidance that PREA auditors\nPrograms\u2019 (OJP\u2019s) Office of the Assistant\nare to follow when conducting an agency or facility\nAttorney General, Bureau of Prisons, Civil\naudit.

Contracting for a PREA Audit\nBefore an auditor enters into a contract for a PREA audit, it is important to understand the\nvarious types of auditing arrangements available to auditors, what should and should not be\nincluded in an audit contract, and rules regarding auditor compensation. Auditing Arrangements This chapter summarizes several types of auditing arrangements that auditors may wish to use\nin their audit practice. Working Independently or Through a Third Party Entity\nAuditors may work as independent contractors or conduct audits through a third party entity\n(e.g., their current employer, an accreditation body, or a consulting firm). Auditors working\nindependently should consider obtaining professional liability insurance, since many facilities\nand agencies require auditors to hold certain minimum insurance coverage. The requirements\nrelated to insurance coverage are often described in PREA auditing requests for proposals from\nagencies or facilities. Employees of correctional agencies can be certified by DOJ to conduct PREA audits. However,\nan auditor may not conduct an official PREA audit for any agency or facility under the\nauthority of that agency, including a private facility operated by contract, if the auditor is or\nhas been employed by or otherwise received financial compensation from the agency, facility,\nor contractor within the past 3 years. Employment within the same state or local government\ndoes not disqualify the auditor, so long as the auditor is not employed directly by or under the\nagency that operates the facility to be audited. 1\nAuditors who conduct audits through a third party entity, whether as an employee or a\ncontractor (e.g., for an accreditation body or consulting firm), must exercise independence and\nintegrity when making their determinations regarding compliance with the PREA Standards. Each certified auditor, regardless of whether he or she works independently or through a third\nparty entity, is personally accountable for complying with all of the DOJ certification\nrequirements and for the accuracy of his or her audit findings. Reciprocal and Circular Auditing\nFacilities or agencies may wish to engage in reciprocal auditing or circular auditing. Reciprocal\nauditing is when auditors employed by two different agencies or facilities audit each other\u2019s\nagency or facility. Circular auditing is when a consortium of three or more states or local\njurisdictions agree to perform no-cost audits within the consortium. Reciprocal auditing is only permitted if the audits are conducted 12 months or more apart. 2 Similarly, circular audits are permissible so long as no impermissible reciprocal audits occur. 1\n2 See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 115.402(a)(1). See the full FAQ here: www.prearesourcecenter.org/node/3224. 4 Lead and Secondary Auditors\nEach PREA audit must have one lead auditor who is ultimately responsible for the conduct of\nthe audit and all work products.",

See the full FAQ here: www.prearesourcecenter.org/node/3224. 4 Lead and Secondary Auditors\nEach PREA audit must have one lead auditor who is ultimately responsible for the conduct of\nthe audit and all work products. A lead auditor can, however, employ other DOJ-certified PREA\nauditors to function as secondary auditors. The PREA Management Office strongly encourages\nthis kind of collaboration among certified auditors. In addition, the lead auditor may employ\nsupport staff who are not DOJ-certified auditors to assist with auditing tasks. Lead auditors must ensure that anyone they employ to\nwork on audits is free of any conflict of interest, as\ndescribed in Chapter 6. 3 Lead auditors are responsible for\nany misconduct, errors, or conflicts of interest attributed to\nany secondary auditors or non-certified support staff they\nemploy\u2014actions that can impact the DOJ certifications of\nlead and secondary auditors. Audit Contracts and Compensation IMPORTANT Under no circumstances may\nindividuals who are not DOJcertified auditors participate or\nengage in the substantive work of\na formal PREA audit unless acting\nunder the direction of a DOJcertified auditor. PREA audits are conducted at the request of any federal, state, local, or private confinement\nfacility, or any agency that oversees such a facility. A facility or agency may contact an auditor\ndirectly (the PREA Resource Center maintains a directory of DOJ-certified auditors) or seek the\nservices of an auditor through procurement announcements, advertisements, or other means. Auditors themselves can also solicit work from agencies and facilities, consistent with their\nunderlying ethics restrictions. Although not part of the audit process, procurement and contract negotiation with agencies\nand facilities seeking a PREA audit are important elements of an auditor\u2019s audit practice. Procurement and contract negotiation may provide early opportunities for an auditor to gauge\nhow ready an agency or facility is for an audit, and the extent of its PREA implementation\nprogress. In addition, during the negotiation process, it is critical for auditors and third party\nentities seeking to contract for a PREA audit to ensure that the facility understands access and\nthe auditing requirements and expectations that are imposed by DOJ and the PREA Standards\nso that all necessary issues can be addressed and accommodated during the audit. Additional\ninformation regarding audit contracts and compensation is detailed below.\n\u2022 3 Audit contracts must be transparent. The contract between the auditor, or third party\nentity, and the audited facility or agency should address all aspects of the audit,\nincluding the specific work to be conducted during each phase of the audit (i.e., preonsite, onsite, evidence review and interim report, and corrective action and final\nreport, as described in this Handbook). The fees, expenses, other compensation, and\npayment schedule are also critical components of the contract; therefore, they must be\ndescribed with specificity in writing. To promote full transparency, auditors are not\npermitted to receive any compensation, monetary or otherwise, not specifically\nprovided in the contract.",

However, incidental items such as water, coffee, and donuts,\nif provided to the auditor, do not have to be specified in the contract, but larger items,\nsuch as meals, or items offered frequently, free of charge, should be described in the\ncontract. See the full FAQs here: www.prearesourcecenter.org/node/3222 and www.prearesourcecenter.org/node/3223. 5 \u2022 Describing the role of third parties and support staff. The contract should identify the\nlead or responsible auditor, and if applicable, list the names of all other DOJ-certified\nPREA auditors and non-certified support staff who will assist the lead auditor during any\nphase of the audit, and provide a brief description of the role of other staff during the\naudit. The contract should also disclose the nature of any third party entity\u2019s\ninvolvement in the PREA audit. For example, an auditor who is hired by ABC PREA\nAuditing, LLC, to conduct a PREA audit of a facility operated by XYZ County Sheriff\u2019s\nDepartment must describe the role of and his or her relationship to ABC PREA Auditing,\nLLC, in the contract. In addition, some agencies may contract with a third party entity\nthat assigns an auditor after the contract is executed. In such instances, the contract\nbetween the agency and the third party entity should be updated with an addendum\nthat lists the name of the lead auditor, and if applicable, lists the names and describes\nthe roles of all other DOJ-certified PREA auditors and non-certified support staff once\nassigned by the third party entity. As a reminder, the audit report must also include\nidentifying information for the lead auditor and, if applicable, for all other DOJ-certified\nPREA auditors and non-certified support staff who assisted during any phase of the\naudit. \u2022 Ensuring compliance with the PREA Standards and DOJ certification requirements. Auditors and third party entities contracting to perform an audit must ensure that\nauditing contracts permit, and do not restrict, auditors\u2019 obligations under the Standards\nand the required audit methodology, as outlined in this Handbook, in FAQs issued by\nthe DOJ PREA Working Group, and in ongoing, mandatory continuing education\nrequirements for auditors (e.g., unfettered facility access, the requirement to obtain\nand preserve documentation and information relied upon in making audit\ndeterminations). \u2022 Ensuring sufficient time to conduct a thorough audit. To ensure that auditors comply\nwith the PREA Standards and follow the audit methodology described in this Handbook,\nthey must consider a number of important variables before discussing how long an audit\nis likely to take, which will directly impact their compensation. Auditors must consider\nthe size and characteristics of the facility, whether secondary auditors and support staff\nwill be involved, and their level of experience. Regardless of whether an agency\ncontracts directly with an auditor or through a third party entity, the audit contract\nshould address these issues and must accommodate the methodological requirements\noutlined in this Handbook (e.g., interviews with staff and inmates, 4 site review, and\ndocumentation collection and review). \u2022 Planning for corrective action.",

The PREA Standards are complex and contain several\nhundred specific provisions that must be substantially met in order for a facility to be\ndeemed in full compliance. For that reason, DOJ expects that corrective action will be\nrequired in most cases. Therefore, contracts between auditors, or third party entities,\nand agencies or facilities should allow for and support corrective action periods for\nauditors to work with the agencies and/or facilities to take steps to address areas of 4 In this Handbook, the term \u201cinmate\u201d is used generally to refer to inmates, residents, and detainees, except when\ndiscussing certain types of facilities or sets of Standards, in which case more specific terminology is used. 6 noncompliance identified during the audit, and for subsequent verification of the\ncorrective action. As such, auditors and agencies/facilities should be aware of the\nlimitations of using \u201cflat fee\u201d contracts. Such contracts pay an auditor a set fee as\ncompensation, regardless of whether the auditor identifies any deficiencies or requires\nany corrective action. These flat fee contracts may have the unintended consequence of\ninappropriately incentivizing auditors to make full compliance findings without requiring\nany corrective action, even in cases where policies and/or practices are not in\ncompliance with the PREA Standards. In addition, auditors are not permitted to accept\nbonus compensation contingent on the outcome of an audit. In the event that the PREA Management Office receives credible allegations that an auditor\nviolated the above requirements in the course of an audit, among other information, the\nauditor will be required to provide the PREA Management Office with a copy of the relevant\naudit contract(s). Gifts A \u201cgift\u201d is anything that has monetary value such as items, food and beverages, or services. Except as provided in this chapter, no DOJ-certified PREA auditor, or any non-certified support\nstaff hired to assist an auditor, may either solicit or accept a gift from any entity or party who\nhas an interest related to the outcome of a particular PREA audit in which that person is\nparticipating.

Because PREA auditors are DOJ-certified, they are in a unique position of public trust with the\nability to impact public confidence in the integrity of the PREA audit function. Many\nstakeholders rely on this audit process and its results, including federal, state, local, and private\nagencies that operate or oversee confinement facilities; facility staff; treatment and service\nproviders; community-based advocacy organizations; courts; attorneys; and people in\nconfinement and their families. This reliance on the ability of PREA auditors to conduct high quality, reliable, objective, and\ncomprehensive PREA audits imposes a significant obligation for them to operate within general\nprinciples of integrity necessary to instill public confidence in the PREA audit process. The\nAuditor Code of Conduct section of the Handbook identifies general principles that govern the\nprofessional and personal conduct of auditors and the underlying rules that support these\nprinciples. As a condition of DOJ auditor certification, auditors must comply with this code of\nconduct.",

As a condition of DOJ auditor certification, auditors must comply with this code of\nconduct. However, these principles are demonstrative of the standards to which an auditor will\nbe held. The PREA Management Office retains the discretion to review whether certain conduct\nnot specifically described in this section nevertheless violates the spirit and intent of this\nAuditor Code of Conduct and may, therefore, subject an auditor to disciplinary action. 8 Guiding Auditor Code of Conduct Principles This chapter discusses the core principles that auditors are expected to uphold in both their\nprofessional and personal conduct: integrity, objectivity, confidentiality, and proficiency and\nprofessionalism. 5\nIntegrity\nIntegrity is the virtue of being honest, fair, and trustworthy. In the context of the PREA audit,\nintegrity demands that auditors apply the Standards fairly, consistently, and comprehensively. In taking such an approach, auditors demonstrate a firm commitment to upholding the overall\nintent of PREA to create or enhance a culture of zero tolerance for sexual abuse and sexual\nharassment inside confinement facilities, and to support policies and practices required by the\nStandards to achieve this goal. Modeling Commitment to\nWith these principles in mind, PREA auditors must:\nthe PREA Standards\n1. Put forth an honest effort to execute auditing\nresponsibilities and apply the PREA Standards in a\nfair, comprehensive, and consistent manner\n2. Avoid any actions which would create the\nappearance of a violation of any law or ethical\nstandards to a reasonable person with full\nknowledge of the relevant facts\n3. Model a commitment to the elimination of sexual\nabuse and sexual harassment in confinement\nAuditors must not: 1. Engage in any conduct of a criminal, reckless,\nnegligent, dishonest, deceitful, or fraudulent nature,\neither by act or omission, that calls their integrity\ninto question\n2. Misrepresent their certification credentials for any\npurpose Auditors should be able to explain\neach of the Standards and the\nunderlying rationale for the\nobligations each Standard\nimposes. For more information\nabout DOJ\u2019s rationale for\nindividual Standards, auditors\nshould see the preamble to the\nPREA Notice of Final Rule available\non the PREA Resource Center\nWebsite. Auditors may encounter\nresistance to PREA among some\nfacilities and agencies\u2014to the\nPREA statute overall or to\nparticular Standards and\nprovisions. Auditors should be\nprepared for such resistance and\nunderstand that the best defense\nis their own thorough\nunderstanding of and\ncommitment to the Standards. Objectivity\nPREA auditors must exhibit the highest level of professional\nobjectivity in gathering evidence and evaluating the policies, procedures, practices, and\noperations of an audited agency or facility. Auditors must exhibit the same level of professional\nobjectivity in communicating information about activities and processes being examined, and in\ncommunicating their reasons for arriving at a particular finding for every Standard and for every\nprovision of a Standard.

Auditors are\nobligated to report any attempt by any individual or entity, including an employee of the\naudited facility or agency and an auditor\u2019s own employer, to inappropriately influence the\noutcome of an audit. Auditors can report such information directly to the PREA Resource\nCenter using the Urgent Helpline at 800\u2013279\u20137732 (press 2 when prompted) or by sending an\nemail to Urgent@prearesourcecenter.org. Auditors may also notify the PREA Management\nOffice at PREACompliance@usdoj.gov. With these principles in mind, PREA auditors must:\n1. Act in an impartial manner, treating each situation and all parties objectively and giving\npreferential treatment to no public or private organization or individual\n2. Use reasonable care and diligence to obtain sufficient facts to support all statements,\nconclusions, and findings of an audit\n3. Make determinations regarding all audit findings on the basis of demonstrable evidence\nor lack thereof\n4. Include in their audit reports all evidence supporting compliance or noncompliance\nwhich, if not included, could distort the final compliance determination\nAuditors must not: 1. Knowingly misrepresent facts when expressing an opinion or finding in an audit report\n2.

Make credibility determinations based solely upon an individual\u2019s status as an inmate,\nresident, detainee, staff member, or agency official\nConfidentiality The only public aspect of a PREA audit is the final report. As discussed in greater detail below,\nauditors are to maintain the confidentiality of the information they collect during the course of\na PREA audit with only three exceptions. First, PREA Standard 115.401(j) states that auditors \u201cshall retain and preserve all\ndocumentation . . . relied upon in making audit determinations.

Auditors may be approached by\nThird, in limited circumstances, there may be a legal or\nprofessional (e.g., as a condition of a professional license or\nauditor certification) obligation to disclose audit-related\ninformation.

Proficiency and Professionalism\nPREA auditors must develop and apply comprehensive knowledge of the PREA Standards, FAQs\nissued by the DOJ PREA Working Group, and the requirements articulated in this Handbook. Moreover, auditors are expected to maintain and improve their auditing skills to ensure that\ntheir audits are high quality, reliable, objective, and comprehensive. When the auditor enters a facility, he or she will be treated as the expert on the PREA\nStandards. Administrators and staff will look to the auditor for information and guidance\nregarding the specifics of PREA, and the meaning and implications of the Standards. This serious\nobligation requires two core elements to be effective: first, understanding the Standards; and\nsecond, knowing the limits of his or her knowledge. With these principles in mind, PREA auditors must:\n1. Have read and understand the PREA Standards\n2.

DOJ-certified PREA\nauditors have a responsibility to avoid any conflicts of interest, or the appearance of any such\nconflict. Conflicts of interest may adversely impact an auditor\u2019s ability, or perceived ability, to\nconduct high quality, reliable, objective, and comprehensive audits. Therefore, auditors should\navoid any personal or financial arrangements that could create a conflict of interest, or the\nappearance of a conflict of interest, that would lead a\nIMPORTANT\nreasonable person to question their objectivity during the\nconduct of a PREA audit.

Such relationships\nare considered to be conflicts of\ninterest and must be identified\nand avoided by auditors. Prior to every audit, the auditor is required to certify in\nwriting that he or she has no conflict of interest through any\nrelationship to the facility to be audited or the agency\noverseeing that facility. 7 The Auditor Report Template\navailable on the PREA Resource Center Website (see\nwww.prearesourcecenter.org/node/1754) includes a\nprompt for auditors to complete this information. Relevant PREA Standard In general, if an auditor has a financial, personal, or recent or current employment relationship\nto an agency, he or she must not conduct audits for that agency. Standard 115.402 is designed\nto minimize the risk of a PREA auditor having any such conflict of interest. There are three provisions under Standard 115.402 that address auditor conflicts of interest. These include the following:\n\u2022 7 115.402(a) \u2013 \u201cAn audit shall be conducted by: (1) A member of a correctional monitoring\nbody that is not part of, or under the authority of, the agency (but may be part of, or\nauthorized by, the relevant State or local government); (2) A member of an auditing\nentity such as an inspector general\u2019s or ombudsperson\u2019s office that is external to the\nagency; or (3) Other outside individuals with relevant experience.\u201d See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 115.403(a). 13 \u2022 115.402(c) \u2013 \u201cNo audit may be conducted by an auditor who has received financial\ncompensation from the agency being audited (except for compensation received for\nconducting prior PREA audits) within the three years prior to the agency\u2019s retention of\nthe auditor.\u201d \u2022 115.402(d) \u2013 \u201cThe agency shall not employ, contract with, or otherwise financially\ncompensate the auditor for three years subsequent to the agency\u2019s retention of the\nauditor, with the exception of contracting for subsequent PREA audits.\u201d Building on Standard 115.402(a), (c), and (d), the following guidance must be used by auditors\nwhen deciding whether to accept an offer to conduct a PREA audit of an agency or facility. Personal Relationships The principles outlined in Standard 115.402 apply to situations in which the auditor\u2019s\nimmediate family members or close personal friends have a conflict of interest. For example, an\nauditor may not conduct an audit of an agency if an immediate family member or close\npersonal friend has been employed by the agency within the last 3 years or has a significant\nfinancial interest in any corporation or other business associated with housing of inmates in\nthat agency. An auditor also may not conduct an official PREA audit for an agency (or facility\nunder the authority of that agency) if the auditor has an immediate family member (including\nparents, spouses, siblings, and children) or close personal friend in the custody of a facility\noperated by the agency under review.",

Conversely, if the auditor, an immediate family member (including parents, spouses, siblings,\nand children), or close personal friend was previously incarcerated within a facility operated by\nthe agency under review, the auditor may conduct an official PREA audit for the agency (or\nfacility under the authority of that agency); however, the auditor must disclose this relationship\nin the audit report. The above requirements relating to personal relationships apply to the lead auditor, all\nsecondary auditors, and all non-certified support staff who an auditor may employ to assist him\nor her in completing the audit. Maintaining Impartiality In order to maintain the objectivity of the PREA audit process, auditors should not receive both\ncompensation from a confinement agency for performing an official PREA audit and any other\npaid employment (including contracts or consultation for audit preparation, training, or\nunrelated technical assistance) from that same entity within 3 years of each other. \u2022 Example 1: PREA auditor Tony is hired by XYZ County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2014either\ndirectly or through a third party entity, ABC PREA Auditing, LLC\u2014to conduct a PREA\naudit of a facility operated by the XYZ County Sheriff\u2019s Department.

Such relationships bias the auditor\u2019s assessment and make it more likely that the auditor\nwill find the facility in full compliance.

Auditor Certification Requirements This section describes in detail the process for becoming a DOJ-certified PREA auditor and the\nrequirements that auditors must follow in order to maintain their certification. PREA Auditor Certification Process\nPREA Standard 115.402(a) and (b) establish minimum qualifications for PREA auditors and\ndirect DOJ to establish a process for auditor certification, as follows:\n(a) An audit shall be conducted by:\n(1) A member of a correctional monitoring body that is not part of, or under the\nauthority of, the agency (but may be part of, or authorized by, the relevant State\nor local government);\n(2) A member of an auditing entity such as an inspector general\u2019s or\nombudsperson\u2019s office that is external to the agency; or\n(3) Other outside individuals with relevant experience. (b) All auditors shall be certified by the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice\nshall develop and issue procedures regarding the certification process, which shall\ninclude training requirements. To fulfill its requirements under Standard 115.402(b), DOJ has established the following\nrequirements for PREA auditor certification (which may be amended as needed):\n1. Three years of significant auditing, monitoring, quality assurance, investigations, or\nsubstantially similar experience with the facility type or set of Standards in which the\n15 applicant seeks certification(s). When seeking both adult and juvenile certifications, an\napplicant must demonstrate at least 3 years of relevant experience in juvenile settings\nor with juvenile populations and at least 1 year of relevant experience in adult settings. Experience in an adult prison, jail, or lockup that houses youthful inmates or youthful\ndetainees does not qualify as experience with juvenile populations or juvenile settings. In addition to applicants who are employed by a corrections, detention, or relevant law\nenforcement agency or facility, PREA auditor training and certification are also open to\napplicants with related work experience in the justice system in which exposure to a\nconfinement agency or facility operations and contact with relevant inmate, resident, or\ndetainee populations are regular components of the position or role. Such positions and\nroles include, but are not limited to probation and parole; prisoner re-entry; law\nenforcement and public safety; legal positions, including prosecution and defense;\ninmate and victim advocacy; onsite technical assistance or consultations related to\ncorrections and/or conditions of confinement; and other settings that provide\nappropriate collateral exposure in confinement facilities. a. Significant auditing experience means regular job responsibilities focused on the\nobjective, unbiased, systematic examination of information to determine the\nadequacy of policies, procedures, and practices, and their compliance with\nestablished standards or guidelines. Paper-based auditing, unless it is part of a\nlarger performance-based audit process, does not qualify as significant auditing\nexperience.",

Field Training Program\nBeginning with the July 2017 PREA Auditor Candidate Training, as a requirement for\ncertification, auditor candidates are required to successfully complete a training audit as part of\nthe Field Training Program. The goal of the Field Training Program is to provide auditor\ncandidates with an opportunity to transfer the knowledge and skills they attained during the\nclassroom-based PREA Auditor Candidate Training to a field-auditing experience in a supervised\nand supportive environment. Specifically, the Field Training Program audit will strengthen\nauditor candidates\u2019 understanding of the PREA Standards, hone their auditing skills, and\nprovide an opportunity to implement the PREA audit methodology. Auditor candidates are assigned a specific training audit based on geographic location and will\nbe expected to complete the full training audit (approximately 19 weeks for the pre-onsite\naudit, onsite, and post-onsite audit phases). 10 More information about the Field Training Participation in the Field Training Program requires approximately 35\u201340 hours during the pre-onsite audit\nphase, a minimum of 55 \u201cworking hours\u201d during the onsite audit phase, and 35\u201340 hours during the post-onsite\naudit phase. 10 18 Program and what is expected of auditor candidates can be found in the Field Training Program\nSyllabus and Manual, which are available in the Auditor Portal. Probationary Certification Status\nBeginning with auditors who attended the March 2015 PREA Auditor Candidate Training, all\nnewly certified auditors are required to enter probationary certification status and must\nsuccessfully complete all the requirements to become fully certified by DOJ. Probationary\ncertification status assists newly certified auditors in learning to effectively and\ncomprehensively communicate their audit findings. Upon completion of the probationary\ncertification status requirements, the PREA Management Office will review the auditor\u2019s body\nof work and make a determination as to whether or not the auditor will receive full\ncertification. Probationary Certification Review Process Auditors on probationary certification status must submit draft reports for their first two audits\nfor review by the PREA Resource Center prior to submitting them to the audited facility. The\ngoal of the PREA Resource Center\u2019s review is to evaluate the degree to which the audit reports\nclearly and thoroughly describe the auditor\u2019s methodology, the evidence collected during all\nphases of the PREA audit process, the auditor\u2019s systematic review and analysis of the evidence,\nand how the auditor connected this information to determine compliance or noncompliance for\neach provision of every Standard. Based on this review, PREA Resource Center staff will provide\ndetailed guidance to the auditor regarding areas of strength and areas in need of improvement. In the ordinary course of an audit, auditors are required to submit an interim report (or final\nreport if there is no corrective action) to the audited facility no more than 45 days after the last\nday of the onsite portion of the audit. To accommodate the probationary certification review\nprocess, the PREA Management Office has extended this timeframe to 60 days for auditors\nunder probationary certification status.

Auditors on probationary certification status must submit their draft reports to the PREA\nResource Center within 30 days of the last day of the onsite portion of the audit. 12 The PREA Resource Center has a template letter available in the Auditor Portal that auditors are encouraged to\nuse to notify the audited facility of the revised audit reporting timeline for probationary certification audit report\nreviews. 12\nFor audits that require a corrective action period, auditors must submit a draft of their interim reports. For\naudits that do not require a corrective action period, auditors must submit drafts of their final reports. 11 19 3.

The duty for auditors to\ndisclose such information creates a culture of awareness and reporting that supports effective\nPREA implementation and accountability in the auditing process. The following two subsections\ndescribe the PREA Management Office\u2019s expectations for self-disclosure and reporting of\ninformation related to possible misconduct of another auditor. Self-Disclosure\nAuditors must immediately disclose to the PREA Management Office any actions that constitute\ngrounds for disciplinary review or disciplinary action (see Chapter 23 and Chapter 28), including:\n\u2022 Any arrest or criminal conviction \u2022 Any finding of liability for fraud or other unlawful behavior that may bear on an\nauditor\u2019s honesty or credibility \u2022 If an auditor is found culpable of, pleads guilty to, or pleads no contest to any\nmisconduct, sexual abuse, sexual harassment, or related conduct through any criminal,\ncivil, or administrative investigation or legal proceeding \u2022 If an auditor is released from or voluntarily leaves employment or contract while under\ncriminal, civil, or administrative investigation for any misconduct, sexual abuse, sexual\nharassment, or related conduct Auditors must report such information directly to the PREA Management Office via email at\nPREACompliance@usdoj.gov. Given the serious nature of the behaviors listed above, such\ndisclosures will be sent directly to disciplinary review where any appropriate remediation steps\nand/or disciplinary action will be determined by the PREA Management Office on a case-bycase basis. 27 Reporting Knowledge or Information about another Auditor\nAuditors are required to report any knowledge or information pertaining to possible auditor\nmisconduct, concerns regarding an auditor\u2019s compliance with DOJ\u2019s certification requirements,\nor other actions that constitute grounds for disciplinary review or disciplinary action (see\nChapter 23 and Chapter 28). The Auditor Feedback Form, located on the PREA Resource\nCenter\u2019s website (see www.prearesourcecenter.org/audit/auditor-feedback-form), is the\nmechanism for submitting complaints or concerns about auditor conduct. Auditors are strongly\nencouraged to provide specific, factual information about the behavior or conduct of a specific\nauditor. Complaints that lack sufficient details will greatly limit the ability of the PREA\nManagement Office to respond to identified issues or concerns. In addition to auditors, corrections agencies and facilities, members of the law enforcement\ncommunity, advocates, and other key stakeholders working to eliminate sexual abuse and\nsexual harassment in confinement are strongly encouraged to report complaints or concerns\nabout auditor conduct using the above-discussed Auditor Feedback Form. Such information is\ncritical for maintaining the integrity of the PREA audit function. Where adequate information is provided, the PREA Management Office reviews and analyzes\nthe report as part of the audit assessment process described in Chapter 20. Based on the nature\nand severity of the report, the PREA Management Office will use the information provided,\ntaken together with auditor performance information gathered during the assessment phase,\nto determine the appropriate interventions and/or disciplinary action. More detailed\ninformation regarding definitions of and sanctions for auditor misconduct is provided in\nChapter 23. Section V.

The audit methodology described in this section is grounded\nin the auditing requirements in the PREA Standards\n(115.401, 115.402, 115.403, 115.404) and FAQs issued by\nthe DOJ PREA Working Group.

The purpose of this section of the Handbook is to clearly\narticulate DOJ\u2019s expectations for the conduct of PREA audits\n28 and establish guidelines and minimum requirements for the audit methodology during each\nphase of the audit. This information is also intended to enable auditors to effectively navigate\nthe negotiation and contracting stage of audit procurement, and ensure that the agreed upon\ntimeframes, costs, and overall audit processes reflect sound methodology and are conducive to\nthe conduct of high integrity audits.

Phase One: Pre-Onsite Audit\nPrior to assessing a facility in person, there are a number of important steps for auditors to\ncarry out during the pre-onsite audit phase. During this phase, which should last approximately\n6\u20138 weeks, the auditor should communicate frequently with facility staff and agency leadership\nabout the audit process, set expectations and timelines, and discuss logistics for all phases of\nthe audit. The auditor should work with facility staff to post notices of the upcoming audit\nthroughout the facility to ensure that inmates have the ability to correspond with auditors in a\nmanner that is consistent with the facility\u2019s confidential treatment of legal mail, that auditors\nreview the information and documentation submitted by the facility via the Pre-Audit\nQuestionnaire and conduct outreach to local advocacy organizations for information relevant to\nPREA compliance and sexual safety at the audited facility. 30 These important activities that should be undertaken by the auditor during the pre-onsite audit\nphase can be broken down into the following four core steps:\n1. Audit Planning and Logistics\n2. Posting Notice of the Audit\n3. Reviewing Facility Policies, Procedures, and Supporting Documentation\n4. Conducting Outreach to Advocacy Organizations These steps are intended to ensure that auditors focus on multiple sources of information\nduring the audit process and reduce the workload in later phases of the audit. Additional details\nare provided for each of these steps below. Audit Planning and Logistics As described above, the pre-onsite audit phase provides an important opportunity for auditors\nto communicate with facility staff and agency leadership regarding the audit process, discuss\nexpectations for the facility and the auditor, review key elements of the contract, and\ncoordinate logistics for the onsite portion of the audit. It is recommended that auditors conduct\nan initial kickoff meeting 16 with key facility and agency staff, and establish a schedule for\ncontinued communication throughout the audit process. Establishing Audit Goals and Expectations From the beginning of the audit, it is important for the auditor to establish a positive working\nrelationship with key facility staff and agency leadership, and to approach the audit as an\nopportunity for positive change that will benefit everyone working and living in the facility.",

Communicating Key Information on the Audit Process In contrast to traditional correctional audits, which largely focus on facility and agency policies\nand procedures, the PREA audit relies on a rigorous, practice-based methodology that assesses\nwhether policies and procedures have been institutionalized. It is important for auditors to\neducate the facility about what it means to conduct a practice-based audit, describe each phase\nof the audit process and the core activities undertaken by the auditor (e.g., in-depth site review\nto directly observe and assess relevant correctional practices), and make it clear that a PREA\naudit will be unlike other correctional audits the facility has received in the past.

A\nfacility\u2019s failure to provide an auditor with access to the necessary documentation or all areas\nof the facility could lead to a finding of noncompliance with Standard 115.401 and any\nunderlying substantive Standards for which the facility has failed to meet its burden of\ndemonstrating compliance. For additional information, see the callout box on p.37. To help the facility prepare for each stage of the audit, the auditor should send the facility a\ncopy of the Process Map, which is described in Chapter 14. Coordinating Audit Logistics The following list provides an overview of some basic logistics that the auditor should discuss\nwith the facility prior to the auditor\u2019s onsite visit to the facility:\n\u2022 Establish a primary point of contact (POC) at the facility or agency who will be\nresponsible for completing the Pre-Audit Questionnaire; responding to questions and/or\nrequests for additional information from the auditor; coordinating and confirming\nposting of the audit notice; and assisting with other agreed-upon tasks. Although it is\nvery helpful to identify a primary POC at the facility, auditors should emphasize and\nclearly convey the expectation that one person in a facility or agency cannot do all of the\nwork associated with preparing for and completing a PREA audit. A team of\nadministrators and staff at the audited agency or facility must work together to support\nthe auditor throughout the process. To that end, auditors are also encouraged to\nidentify a secondary POC at the facility who is involved in the audit process, can assist\nthe primary POC, and serve as a backup should the primary POC be unavailable. \u2022 Agree on deadlines for key milestones in the audit process. 32 \u2022 Develop an audit schedule. \u2022 Review key elements of the audit contract (e.g., any permissible limitations on\nscheduling or contingencies based on facility emergencies). \u2022 Discuss logistics for the onsite phase of the audit, including but not limited to\ntransportation to and from the facility, meals, daily schedule for the audit, meeting\nspace, work space with internet access and adequate outlets, permissible technology\n(e.g., laptop, cell phone, digital camera) and other necessary audit materials (e.g.,\nbinders, notebooks, writing utensils), dress code, and security procedures.",

Posting Notice of the Audit\nStandard 115.401(n) states, \u201cInmates, residents, and detainees shall be permitted to send\nconfidential information or correspondence to the auditor in the same manner as if they were\ncommunicating with legal counsel.\u201d To accomplish this communication with the auditor,\nauditors are responsible for working with the facility to ensure that inmates are given adequate\nnotice of the audit and the information necessary to communicate confidentially with the\nauditor if they choose. Auditors should inquire early in the process how the facility plans to\nensure the confidentiality of such communication. When and Where to Post the Notice It is strongly recommended that auditors instruct facilities to post the notice of the upcoming\nPREA audit at least 6 weeks prior to the onsite portion of the audit throughout the facility, in\nplaces where it will be visible to all inmates and staff (e.g.,\nAccessibility of the Audit\nvisiting areas, housing units, and recreational spaces).

Confidential Correspondence with Inmates and Staff\nAuditors should also plan to receive confidential correspondence from inmates and staff, and\nshould take one or more of the following steps to adequately respond to such correspondence.\n\u2022 Interviews with Inmates. Except where such correspondence clearly does not relate to\nPREA or sexual safety in the audited facility, auditors must strive to include those\ninmates who submit correspondence in their interview selections (using the relevant\nprotocols), unless the inmates are no longer in the custody of the facility. \u2022 Interviews with Staff. Auditors should generally take the same approach with staff who\nsubmit correspondence, and ensure that such staff are included in the interview process\nand given an opportunity to speak directly about any concerns or issues voiced in the\ncorrespondence. \u2022 Reviewing Documentation. Auditors should attempt to follow up on issues voiced by\ninmates and/or staff during the documentation review stage of the audit to determine\nwhether such issues are reflected in facility documentation and, where applicable, the\nextent to which the facility followed the appropriate policies and procedures in\nresponse to the issues or concerns identified. \u2022 Responding to Urgent Correspondence. In cases where correspondence indicates that\nan inmate is in imminent harm or threatening self-harm or harm to others, the auditor\nshould make any appropriate notifications. For example, when auditors are informed\nthat a resident in a juvenile facility alleges current abuse, the auditor should determine\nwhether there is a legal requirement to notify child protective services or another\ndesignated entity. In the absence of a legal requirement, the auditor should determine\nwhether such a disclosure would be proper. When auditors receive information that an\nadult inmate is in imminent danger of abuse, auditors should promptly notify the agency\nPREA coordinator or other designated individual or entity. However, auditors must\ncarefully balance the need to report with any specific requests and expectations the\ninmate may have regarding confidentiality or anonymity. 34 Reviewing Facility Policies, Procedures, and Supporting Documentation\nStandard 115.401 articulates the auditor\u2019s right to access and the requirements for reviewing\nfacility and agency documentation throughout all four phases of the PREA audit (see callout box\nfor a list of applicable provisions and requirements).

However, auditors are entitled to\n\u2022\nrequest and receive sensitive and/or non-public\ndocuments and information at any stage of the\naudit process, including during the pre-onsite\naudit phase. Reviewing some additional\ncategories of substantive documents prior to the\nonsite portion of the audit may permit the auditor to work more efficiently while onsite at the\nfacility. In particular, auditors are strongly encouraged to request that the facility provide (at a\nminimum) a list of all allegations of sexual abuse and sexual harassment received in the 12\nmonths preceding the audit (or longer if determined necessary by the auditor). The facility\u2019s ability to produce this information prior to the auditor\u2019s onsite visit to the facility\nwill provide an important early indicator of the facility\u2019s audit preparedness and level of\ncompliance. In the event that a facility cannot produce this list, the auditor should clearly\ncommunicate to the facility that, as a result, there is a high probability that it will be out of\ncompliance with several other Standards that rely on this list to assess compliance, such as\nStandards 115.61\u2013115.68, which describe the facility\u2019s responsibilities for responding to inmate\nreports of sexual abuse and sexual harassment. Of course, as with any stage of the audit\nprocess and explained elsewhere, auditors must use appropriate safeguards to ensure such\ninformation is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized parties. Additionally, auditors should request a diagram of the physical plant (i.e., building plan) and\nreview it before the onsite visit to the facility. Becoming familiar with the physical plant\nstructure allows auditors to thoroughly plan the facility site review and confirm that all areas of\nthe facility are observed. The auditor should provide the Pre-Audit Questionnaire to the facility sufficiently early in the\nprocess (approximately 6 to 8 weeks prior to the onsite audit) to permit the facility to provide\n35 all the necessary information to the auditor at least 4 weeks before the auditor arrives onsite. During the planning and logistics stage of the pre-onsite audit, the auditor and the facility\nshould agree upon a date for the Pre-Audit Questionnaire to be completed by the facility. The\ndeadline for completion should allow for adequate time in advance of the auditor\u2019s onsite visit\nto the facility for follow-up questions and additional documentation requests.",

The auditor should also work with the facility to identify a facility staff member (e.g., PREA\ncoordinator, PREA compliance manager) who will coordinate and lead completion of the PreAudit Questionnaire and ensure that all of the auditor\u2019s questions are adequately addressed. As\npreviously stated, auditors should inform facilities that neither completion of the Pre-Audit\nQuestionnaire nor the PREA audit is one person\u2019s responsibility. It is a responsibility that is\nshared by the designated facility POC, facility leadership, and key staff who oversee various\nfacility operations (e.g., classification, medical, mental health, food services, education, and\ncontract administration). Auditors should encourage facility POCs to work with a team of staff\nfrom departments across the facility or agency to collect the required documentation and\ncomplete the Pre-Audit Questionnaire. Encouraging this collaborative process from the\nbeginning of the audit will prepare staff across the facility and agency for the onsite phase of\nthe audit, and create broader awareness of sexual safety and the PREA audit process. Completion of the Pre-Audit Questionnaire and the auditor\u2019s initial analysis of facility and\nagency documentation are critical components of the audit process. These steps lay the\nfoundation for the audit and form the basis for the auditor\u2019s understanding of the facility\u2019s\noperations, terminology, structure, population, and other important information. For auditors who use the Online Audit System, the designated POC at the facility can upload the\ncompleted Pre-Audit Questionnaire directly to the online platform. The documents are stored\nand available for review by the auditor. Another benefit of using the Online Audit System is that\ninformation provided in the Pre-Audit Questionnaire will auto-populate portions of other tools\nand templates the auditor will use later in the process (e.g. the Auditor Compliance Tool and\naudit report). This is a time saver for auditors who otherwise have to type the same information\ninto different forms. For auditors who are not utilizing the Online Audit System, the completed\nPre-Audit Questionnaire and related documents can be emailed or saved onto an encrypted\nportable drive and mailed to the auditor. For information on auditor requirements for\nmaintaining the safety and security of audit documentation, refer to Chapter 5. Once the Pre-Audit Questionnaire is complete and all documentation has been received, the\nauditor should conduct a thorough review, identify gaps or issues with the submitted\ndocumentation, and follow up with the facility POC with requests for additional information\nand/or documentation, as needed. To facilitate and document this process, auditors are\nencouraged to use the Issue Log and File Review Template, which are available in the Auditor\nPortal. In preparation for the onsite phase of the audit, auditors are strongly encouraged to\nbegin completing the pre-onsite audit portions of the Auditor Compliance Tool during their\nreview of the Pre-Audit Questionnaire (see Chapter 16 for additional details on completing the\nAuditor Compliance Tool). Because most PREA Standards require some form of documentation to verify the facility\u2019s\ncompliance, auditors are required to review a large number and variety of documents.",

In particular, there are times when external inmate or victim advocates have\ninformation about sexual abuse and sexual harassment at the facility that may not otherwise\nbecome apparent to an auditor during the course of the audit. It is also important to note that\nauditors may not always be successful in reaching advocacy organizations during the pre-onsite\naudit phase.

Similarly, for audits of\nadult facilities, auditors should conduct outreach to state and/or local adult protective services,\nagencies that are generally responsible for monitoring abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older\nadults and adults with physical or cognitive disabilities. Some states also maintain external\noversight bodies that publish reports or may have useful information for an auditor.

These activities can be broken down into the following\nthree core components of the onsite audit:\n\u2022 Site Review \u2022 Conducting Interviews \u2022 Documentation Selection and Review These core components form the foundation of a practice-based audit methodology. An\nauditor\u2019s fidelity to these steps is critical for conducting a high quality, reliable, objective, and\ncomprehensive audit. It is important to remember that the primary purpose of the onsite\nphase of the PREA audit is to assess the day-to-day practices used by facility staff to promote\nsexual safety. It is not appropriate to focus only or primarily on written policies and procedures\nwhen conducting a PREA audit. The importance of auditors\u2019 observations, interviews with staff\nand inmates, and review of facility documentation is reflected in Standard 115.401(e), which\nstates, \u201cThe agency shall bear the burden of demonstrating compliance with the standards.\u201d Therefore, an agency must be compliant not only in policy but must also demonstrate\ninstitutionalization of the Standards in its day-to-day practices. An agency or facility that is\nunable to provide sufficient evidence of compliance, or provides substantially conflicting\ninformation or evidence regarding compliance, has failed to meet its burden. Significantly, the\nunavailability of documentation or information required to adequately evaluate and\ndemonstrate compliance requires a finding of \u201cDoes Not Meet Standard\u201d for Standard\n115.401(e). While working onsite, auditors should rely on the Auditor Compliance Tool to gather and\norganize information they will use to make compliance determinations. The Auditor\nCompliance Tool walks the auditor step by step through each provision of every Standard,\npairing the provision itself with the detailed requirements for compliance and noting how, as\nwell as when, during the audit process the auditor should verify that the facility meets those\nrequirements. Auditors must keep thorough notes while working on site. Notes are a critical\nelement of the audit process because they help auditors recall important details when it comes\ntime to write the audit report.

Notes are a critical\nelement of the audit process because they help auditors recall important details when it comes\ntime to write the audit report. They are also required under Standard 115.401(j), which states,\n39 \u201cThe auditor shall retain and preserve all documentation (including, e.g., video tapes and\ninterview notes) relied upon in making audit determinations. Such documentation shall be\nprovided to the Department of Justice upon request.\u201d For this reason, the Auditor Compliance\nTool provides space for the auditor to describe observations, reflections, follow-up questions,\nand other comments. When onsite, the auditor should also verify any information that the\nfacility provided during the pre-onsite audit phase that may lead to a finding of noncompliance\nwith the Standards. Using the Auditor Compliance Tool consistently throughout the audit allows\nthe auditor to keep track of the evidence collected for each Standard and more easily identify\nthose Standards that may need additional follow up while onsite. Each step in the onsite audit phase is described in greater detail below. Site Review\nPREA Standard 115.401(h) states, \u201cThe auditor shall have access to, and shall observe, all areas\nof the audited facilities.\u201d In order to meet the requirements in this Standard, the site review\nportion of the onsite audit must include a thorough examination of the entire facility. As stated\nin Chapter 15, auditors should request a diagram of the physical plant during the pre-onsite\naudit phase and become familiar with the facility layout to ensure that all areas of the facility\nare thoroughly observed. The site review is not a casual tour of the facility. It is an active,\ninquiring process that includes talking with staff and inmates to determine whether, and the\nextent to which, the audited facility\u2019s practices demonstrate compliance with the Standards. The review of practices during the site review requires active engagement with critical facility\nfunctions such as intake and risk screening; cross-gender announcement; grievance process;\nuse of signage throughout the facility (e.g., notice of the\nIMPORTANT\naudit, PREA posters); activity in the housing units; bathroom\nand shower procedures; staffing ratios; cameras and\nAuditors are encouraged to have\nsurveillance technology deployment and use; working\ninformal conversations with\ncondition of telephones, kiosks, and other devices; access to\ninmates and staff during the site\nreporting entities; and supervision practices.

If allowed by the facility, the auditor is also encouraged to take photographs of facility areas\nthat present problems with compliance (e.g., cells that allow for direct sight into toilet areas)\nand/or where the facility may be exceeding a Standard or otherwise demonstrating a promising\npractice (e.g., victim-centric design and placement of PREA inmate education materials). With\npermission from the facility, photographs of promising practices may serve as useful examples\nfor auditors to provide to staff and administrators during subsequent audits. Auditors should 40 take care to abide by all facility restrictions on photography and should only take photographs\nof the physical plant. The Audit Instrument includes Site Review Instructions to guide auditors in conducting a\ncomprehensive site review. In addition, auditors are encouraged to use the Site Review\nTemplate to document this process, which can be found on the Auditor Portal. Some areas of a\nfacility require more attention than others, and the auditor should read and follow the Site\nReview Instructions carefully. For instance, facility staff may advise the auditor that inmates are\nnot allowed in a particular area of the facility or that there are certain areas where only staff\nhave access (e.g., closets, offices). Because these are spaces where sexual abuse may be more\nlikely to occur, the auditor should ensure that these areas of the facility are observed during the\nsite review. Even when taking great care, the auditor may need to re-inspect certain areas of\nthe facility later in the process if information obtained from interviews, documentation review,\nor other sources raises questions or concerns. As stated above, auditors must also take\nthorough notes and document their observations during the site review. This will allow the\nauditor to conduct a more efficient and thorough review of the evidence during the post-onsite\naudit phase. Defining a Housing Unit While conducting the site review, auditors should take care to accurately count the number of\nhousing units according to the definition issued by the DOJ PREA Working Group. Facilities\noften define a housing unit differently from the definition under the PREA Standards; thus,\nauditors should not rely solely on the number of housing units the facility reports during\ncontract negotiations or during the pre-onsite audit phase. Auditors should make an\nindependent determination regarding the number of housing units during the site review to\nensure that they are able to fully comply with the interview sampling requirements described in\nthe next subsection and appropriately assess the facility\u2019s compliance with the Standards that\nmay be impacted by this determination. In particular, auditors should note that, according to\nthe definition from the DOJ PREA Working Group, a single control room that connects multiple\npods does not constitute a single housing unit. But rather, the \u201carchitectural design and\nfunctional use of these multiple pods indicate that they are managed as distinct housing units.\u201d",

But rather, the \u201carchitectural design and\nfunctional use of these multiple pods indicate that they are managed as distinct housing units.\u201d The DOJ PREA Working Group defines a housing unit as follows: 17\nThe question has been raised in particular as it relates to facilities that have\nadjacent or interconnected units. The most common concept of a housing unit is architectural. The generally agreedupon definition is a space that is enclosed by physical barriers accessed through\none or more doors of various types, including commercial-grade swing doors, steel\nsliding doors, interlocking sally port doors, etc. In addition to the primary entrance\nand exit, additional doors are often included to meet life safety codes. The unit\ncontains sleeping space, sanitary facilities (including toilets, lavatories, and\nshowers), and a dayroom or leisure space in differing configurations. Many facilities are designed with modules or pods clustered around a control\nroom. This multiple-pod design provides the facility with certain staff efficiencies\n17 See www.prearesourcecenter.org/node/3209. 41 and economies of scale. At the same time, the design affords the flexibility to\nseparately house inmates of differing security levels, or who are grouped by some\nother operational or service scheme. Generally, the control room is enclosed by\nsecurity glass, and in some cases, this allows inmates to see into neighboring pods. However, observation from one unit to another is usually limited by angled site\nlines. In some cases, the facility has prevented this entirely by installing one-way\nglass. Both the architectural design and functional use of these multiple pods indicate\nthat they are managed as distinct housing units. Conducting Interviews The interview process is among the most important, and most challenging, elements of a PREA\naudit. Interviews are also a mandatory part of the auditing process. There are two PREA\nStandards that address an auditor\u2019s responsibility to conduct interviews. Standard 115.401(k)\nstates, \u201cThe auditor shall interview a representative sample of inmates, residents, and\ndetainees, and of staff, supervisors, and administrators.\u201d Standard 115.401(m) provides the\nauditor the right to conduct confidential interviews, stating, \u201cThe auditor shall be permitted to\nconduct private interviews with inmates, residents, and detainees.\u201d The objective of conducting one-on-one interviews with inmates is to provide a safe space\nwhere inmates can freely discuss their experiences at and perspectives of the facility on\nsensitive issues related to sexual safety. Although not specifically required by the Standards,\nprivate interviews with staff also help to uncover information and perspectives that may not\nsurface when individuals are speaking in the company of others. For this reason, auditors are\nstrongly encouraged to conduct interviews with only one staff member at a time in a private\nsetting to ensure they are accurately capturing that\nIMPORTANT\nindividual\u2019s knowledge of the PREA Standards, sexual safety\nin confinement, and his or her specific roles and\nAuditors who do not take and\nresponsibilities. maintain interview notes will be\nThe Audit Instrument includes six interview protocols for\ninterviewing different categories of inmates and staff as\nlisted below:\n\u2022 Agency head or designee \u2022 Warden or designee \u2022 PREA coordinator/PREA compliance manager \u2022 Specialized staff",

Auditors should take\ncomprehensive notes during all\ninmate and staff interviews. In\nmost cases, it is not possible to\nrely on memory to reconstruct\nwhat was said, by whom, or at\nwhat point. Notes are the best\nway for auditors to guide their\nevaluation of interview content\nand its relationship to other\nevidence when making\ncompliance determinations for\neach provision of every Standard. Each interview protocol is designed to elicit information\nabout practices in the facility that relate to specific PREA Standards and more general attitudes\nabout preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment. It is important to\nremember that these interview protocols are just the starting point for a conversation that\n42 yields useful information. The protocol questions are not intended to provide a script for use\nduring the interview, but rather serve as a guide or checklist to ensure that auditors understand\nwhat information must be gained from the interview. If read as a script, the auditor would be\nasking leading questions that will not yield useful information. Additionally, the protocols do\nnot cover every Standard that auditors may need to cover during a particular interview. Auditors should use the interview protocols in conjunction with the Auditor Compliance Tool\nand information collected throughout the audit process to inform what additional information\nshould be covered. The subsections below provide more detailed guidance for conducting individual interviews\nwith inmates and staff. This guidance is not a substitute for the interview protocols in the Audit\nInstrument. Auditors are required to use the appropriate protocols as the foundation for every\ninterview. Navigating Mandatory Reporting Laws and Policies\nEach state and territory has its own mandatory reporting laws that require certain individuals to\nreport incidents or suspicions of abuse, neglect, or maltreatment of vulnerable persons. The\nmost familiar of these laws govern the reporting of child abuse and neglect, but there are also\nlaws in many jurisdictions that require reporting abuse and neglect of elderly, disabled, or other\nvulnerable individuals, which may include incarcerated persons. Before committing to an audit, the auditor should determine whether he or she qualifies as a\nmandatory reporter in the jurisdiction where the audit will take place. Auditors should work\nwith the requesting facility and agency to learn the mandatory reporting laws in that\njurisdiction and any rules the facility or agency may have, how to comply with relevant laws and\npolicies, and the identity of the entity or individual designated to receive such reports. Auditors\nare strongly encouraged to include clear and specific details regarding mandatory reporting in\ntheir contracts with facilities and agencies, as well as in the audit notices that are posted\nthroughout the facility. In practical terms, mandatory reporting places limits on an auditor\u2019s ability to assure\nconfidentiality. Prior to interviewing or having informal conversations with any inmate or staff\nmember, the auditor must explain any mandatory reporting requirements.",

For more information on mandatory reporting, The Project on Addressing Prison Rape at the\nAmerican University Washington College of Law maintains a repository of mandatory reporting\nlaws in all 50 states (see www.wcl.american.edu/endsilence/statesurveys.cfm). Interviewing Inmates The perspectives of inmates are essential to understanding the practices, procedures, and\nculture of a confinement facility. The objectives of inmate interviews are to understand the\nfacility\u2019s practices from the inmate\u2019s perspective and determine the extent to which inmates\nare knowledgeable about the facility\u2019s obligations to keep them safe from sexual abuse and\nsexual harassment. As required under Standard 115.401(k), auditors must interview a\nrepresentative sample of inmates, and must use information collected during these interviews\nto inform compliance determinations during the post-onsite audit phase. The subsections below detail specific guidance regarding the appropriate sampling\nmethodology and the minimum number of inmates that auditors are required to interview. 43 Interviews with Randomly Selected Inmates\nAuditors must obtain an up-to-date inmate roster (or the equivalent) on or just before the first\nday of the audit, and use this roster to make random interview selections. It is highly\nrecommended that auditors obtain an inmate roster that is organized by housing unit. This will\nensure that auditors select an interview sample that is geographically diverse, meaning that the\ninmates an auditor selects should be from as many housing units as possible in different\nlocations throughout the facility. Auditors are also advised to obtain an inmate roster that is\nsorted alphabetically to assist, when necessary, with identifying specific inmates and crossreferencing with other information collected during the audit. Auditors should be aware that interview selections may be subject to change for a variety of\nreasons such as inmate refusals or operational factors (e.g., discharge of a selected\ninterviewee). To minimize disruption to the audit process and to the audited facility\u2019s normal\nroutine, alternate selections should be identified in advance. Where feasible, auditors should\nalso oversample in housing units that house specialized subpopulations. Oversampling refers to\nthe practice of selecting more individuals from a subgroup than would generally be the case if\neveryone in the population had an equal chance of being selected. For example, if an auditor is\nconducting one inmate interview per housing unit in a facility that has 10 male housing units\nand 2 female housing units, the auditor would only capture interviews with 2 female inmates. But, if the auditor oversamples by selecting four to six female inmates for interviews, this will\nhelp to ensure their perspectives and experiences are adequately represented in the audit\nfindings, even though women are a distinct minority in this facility. Other specialized\nsubpopulations that may be housed together include inmates housed in medical or mental\nhealth wings, protective custody units, and special programming units, among others. Auditors should plan to spend at least 20 minutes on each random inmate interview in order to\nelicit useful information. While conducting these interviews, auditors should also be prepared\nto ask additional follow-up questions from the targeted inmate interview protocols where\nappropriate.",

In this\nscenario, the auditor should ask questions from the applicable targeted interview protocols\nincluded in the Audit Instrument. Interview rubrics listing the required number of random inmate interviews by facility type and\npopulation size are presented below in Tables 1\u20134. Interviews with Targeted Inmate Populations\nAssessing a facility\u2019s day-to-day practices for ensuring the sexual safety of all inmates is a crucial\nelement of the audit. One of the ways to get a strong sense of these practices and of actual\nsexual safety is to interview appropriate numbers of the most vulnerable populations in\ncustody. Auditors must ensure that these populations are adequately represented in the\ninterview process. To accomplish this, auditors should work with the facility to obtain a list of all\ninmates that fall within the prescribed target populations, including their housing units, so\nauditors can ensure geographic diversity. Auditors must attempt to interview a selection of\ninmates belonging to each of the following targeted populations. \u2022\n\u2022 Youthful inmates/detainees confined in adult prisons, jails, and lockups\nYouthful inmates held in segregated housing to provide sight and sound separation\n44 \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Inmates with a physical or cognitive disability\nInmates who are LEP\nTransgender and intersex inmates\nLesbian, gay, and bisexual inmates\nInmates placed in segregated housing for their own protection from sexual victimization\nJuvenile residents in isolation in juvenile facilities\nInmates who reported sexual abuse that occurred in the facility\nInmates who reported prior sexual victimization during risk screening The number of interviews of individuals in the targeted populations must comport with the\nrequirements presented in Tables 1\u20134 below. In some facilities, auditors may be told that there\nare no members of one or more of the targeted populations. Auditors have a responsibility to\ncorroborate such a statement, and can do so based on information obtained from the Pre-Audit\nQuestionnaire; documentation reviewed onsite; and discussions with screening, classification,\nmedical, and mental health staff, among others. Auditors should evaluate the extent to which a facility appropriately and consistently collects,\nmaintains, and tracks relevant information about whether an inmate is a member of a targeted\npopulation. If the auditor is not persuaded that the facility is sufficiently able to consistently\nidentify members of the targeted populations, then the auditor should not be willing to accept\nclaims of \u201cnone here\u201d without further probing. Auditors should also be aware of other\nStandards that may be impacted by a facility\u2019s inability to identify members of certain targeted\npopulations. For example, a facility that is unable to identify any inmates who are lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTI) or gender nonconforming may not be meeting its\nobligations for screening inmates for risk of victimization and abusiveness under Standard\n115.41.",

Selecting a Representative Sample of Inmates\nStandard 115.401(k) requires that auditors \u201cshall interview a representative sample of inmates,\nresidents, and detainees.\u201d Representative sampling means that auditors must select a group of\ninmates whose characteristics reflect the total inmate population in the audited facility. In\norder to guide auditors in conducting an adequate number of inmate interviews, the PREA\nManagement Office has established detailed requirements that prescribe the minimum number\nand types of inmate interviews that must be conducted according to the facility type and total\ninmate population. The interview rubrics presented in Tables 1\u20134 below provide the minimum number of inmate\ninterviews that must be conducted for each facility type: Prisons and Jails, Lockups, Community\nConfinement Facilities, and Juvenile Facilities. When determining the required number of\ninmate interviews, auditors should first determine the total inmate population as of the first\nday of the onsite portion of the audit. This should be based on the inmate roster and in\nconjunction with other information such as discharges, inmate programming (e.g., work\nrelease, inmates temporarily out of the facility for medical appointments or court\nappearances), and other factors that may impact the facility population during the audit.",

Auditors should then use this information to identify the inmate interview requirements that\nmatch the type of audited facility and the population size (as of the first day of the onsite\nportion of the audit) detailed in Tables 1\u20134 below. Using the guidance presented earlier in this\nchapter, auditors should then select the requisite number of random and targeted inmate\ninterviewees. Guidelines for Inmate Interviews Before using the interview rubrics in Tables 1\u20134 below to identify the required number of\ninmate interviews, auditors must first understand how the core requirements in the rubrics are\ndefined.\n\u2022 Overall Minimum Number of Inmate/Resident/Detainee Interviews. This number\nrefers to the absolute minimum number of inmates/residents/detainees that the\nauditor is required to interview during an audit. The number of random and targeted\ninterviews should meet or exceed the overall minimum interview threshold. Even when\nan auditor is unable to conduct the minimum number of targeted interviews (e.g., the\nfacility does not house a certain targeted population), the auditor must select additional\ninmates/residents/detainees in order to meet the minimum threshold. 18 \u2022 Minimum Number of Random Inmate/Resident/Detainee Interviews. This number\nrefers to the minimum number of inmates/residents/detainees that the auditor is\nrequired to randomly select and interview during an audit. For very small facilities, auditors may be unable to meet the overall minimum number of\ninmate/resident/detainee interviews. See the Subsection below titled \u201cRequired Documentation when Interview\nRequirements Are Not Met\u201d for guidance on how to document any deviations from the minimum threshold. 18 46 \u2022 Minimum Number of Targeted Inmate/Resident/Detainee Interviews. This number\nrefers to the minimum number of targeted inmates/residents/detainees that the\nauditor is required to interview during an audit. Importantly, the requirement refers to\nthe minimum number of individuals who are required to be interviewed, not the\nnumber of protocols used.

The numbers presented in the interview rubrics\npertain only to formal interviews conducted using the interview protocols included in\nthe Audit Instrument. Informal conversations with inmates during the site review, while\nstrongly encouraged, do not count toward the number of inmate interviews required for\neach audit. \u2022 Importance of conducting interviews with inmates in a private setting. It is critical that\ninmates have an opportunity to speak privately with an auditor. Remember that\nStandard 115.401(m) provides the auditor with the right to conduct confidential\ninterviews, stating, \u201cThe auditor shall be permitted to conduct private interviews with\ninmates, residents, and detainees.\u201d As such, auditors may have informal conversations\nwith groups of inmates during the site review process; however, auditors may not count 47 these group conversations with inmates toward meeting the requisite number of inmate\ninterviews. \u2022 All inmate interviews are voluntary. An inmate can refuse to participate without\nconsequences. In this event, auditors must select additional inmates, as necessary, to\nmeet the minimum required number of inmate interviews. When an inmate chooses not\nto participate in an interview, auditors are encouraged to continue speaking with the\ninterviewee for a commensurate amount of time about topics that are unrelated to\nPREA (e.g., hobbies, sports, television) so that other inmates and staff cannot detect\nwho participated in an interview and who did not. Importantly, if the interviewee begins\nto discuss information related to PREA or the conversation migrates to PREA-related\ntopics, the auditor must again ask the inmate if he or she would like to answer questions\nrelated to PREA. Only if the inmate agrees to participate in the interview should the\nauditor allow the conversation to continue regarding PREA and sexual safety within the\nfacility. \u2022 Ensuring that inmates are free from external pressure to participate. Before beginning\nan interview, the auditor should ask the inmate to confirm that he or she has not been\npressured by anyone to consent to be interviewed, to refuse to be interviewed, or\ncoached on what to say during the interview. \u2022 How to count random and targeted inmate interviews.

If it becomes apparent\nduring the course of an interview with an inmate selected at random that he or she falls\nwithin one or more of the required targeted inmate populations, and the auditor uses\nadditional protocols to capture the relevant information, the auditor can count the\ninterview as either a random interview or as a targeted interview, but not both. \u2022 How to meet the minimum threshold for targeted inmate interviews. If an auditor is\nunable to identify an inmate from one of the targeted inmate populations (e.g., the\nfacility does not house youthful inmates) or an inmate belonging to a targeted\npopulation does not wish to participate in an interview, the auditor must select inmates\nfrom other targeted populations in order to meet the minimum number of targeted\ninmate interviews. If the auditor is unable to interview an adequate number of inmates\nto meet the minimum threshold for targeted interviews, he or she should then conduct\nadditional random inmate interviews in order to comply with the overall minimum\nnumber of interviews. As stated above, these additional random inmate interviews\ncannot count toward meeting the targeted inmate interview requirements. Rather,\nauditors must thoroughly document why the required number of targeted inmate\ninterviews could not be met and their strategy for conducting additional random inmate\ninterviews in order to meet the overall minimum number of required interviews. By way\nof example, if an auditor is completing an audit of a jail with fewer than 50 inmates, and\nhe or she is only able to conduct 3 targeted inmate interviews, that auditor will then\nneed to conduct 2 additional random inmate interviews (for a total of 7 random inmate\ninterviews) to meet the overall minimum threshold of 10 inmate interviews. 48 \u2022 Interviewing inmates who submit confidential correspondence. As stated in the\nprevious chapter, in their interview selections, auditors must strive to include any\ninmates who submit confidential correspondence unless an inmate is no longer in the\ncustody of the facility or the correspondence clearly does not relate to PREA or sexual\nsafety in the audited facility. For the purpose of meeting the minimum number of\ninmate interviews, such interviews may be counted as random or targeted depending\non the nature of the interview. \u2022 Ensuring a geographically diverse sample of inmates. When selecting inmates for\ninterviews, whether targeted or random, auditors must ensure that the sample is\ngeographically diverse, meaning that the inmates an auditor selects should be from as\nmany housing units as possible in different locations throughout the facility. In cases\nwhere the number of housing units is greater than the number of required interviews,\nthere should ideally not be any interviewees selected from the same housing unit,\nalthough this may be constrained by the number and location of certain targeted inmate\npopulations. Conversely, where the number of housing units is less than the number of\nrequired interviews, auditors should select at least one inmate from each housing unit\nfor an interview. \u2022 Documenting how geographic diversity was achieved.",

Auditors should plan for some flexibility in these very small facility settings, but this\nflexibility should facilitate interviews of all inmates, residents, and detainees, as appropriate. One exception to this is when one or more inmates declines to be interviewed. If for any\nreason, regardless of facility size, an auditor does not conduct the minimum numbers of\ninterviews prescribed above, he or she must thoroughly document this in his or her notes and\ninclude a discussion of why this was not possible in the audit narrative portion of the audit 53 report. Auditors must be mindful, however, to ensure that those inmates who participated in\nan interview are not identifiable to staff and others based on the information provided. Interviewing Staff\nStaff interviews are another important element of a PREA audit. Standard \u00a7 115.401(k) requires\nthat \u201cthe auditor shall interview a representative sample of . . . staff, supervisors, and\nadministrators\u201d in each audited facility. The primary purpose of interviewing facility staff is to\ndetermine whether and to what extent they understand their responsibilities under the PREA\nStandards, as well as the obligations imposed on the facility and agency. In addition, interviews\nof staff provide information on the extent to which a zero tolerance culture for sexual abuse\nand sexual harassment has been implemented in the facility and agency. Similar to interviews with inmates, auditors must conduct interviews with a random sample of\nstaff selected from varying shifts and work assignments, as well as targeted interviews with\nstaff who have specialized roles and responsibilities within the facility. The Audit Instrument\nincludes interview protocols for both random and specialized interviews with staff. The subsections below detail specific guidance regarding the appropriate sampling\nmethodology and the minimum number of staff that auditors are required to interview.

However, in cases where staff opt not to participate in the interview or respond to\ncertain questions, auditors should inform staff that their decision not to participate may impact\nthe audit findings, and the auditor may have to find the facility out of compliance with certain\nStandards if they are unable to adequately corroborate information through interviews with\nstaff. If this occurs, auditors must select additional staff, as necessary, to meet the minimum\nnumber of interviews required, as described above. Additionally, before beginning an interview,\nthe auditor should ask the staff member to confirm that he or she has not been pressured by\nanyone to consent to be interviewed, to refuse to be interviewed, or coached on what to say\nduring the interview. 54 Random staff interviews should require approximately 20 minutes, but may go significantly\nlonger depending on the amount of information staff have to contribute. In general, auditors\nshould develop an interviewing practice that enables them to elicit as much useful information\nfrom staff as possible (see the callout box with useful interviewing tips below).

For example, in a\nfacility where all line staff serve as first responders, it is recommended that the auditor use\nboth the Interview Guide for a Random Sample of Staff protocol and the Security Staff and NonSecurity Staff who Have Acted as First Responders protocol when conducting interviews with\nrandomly selected staff. In such circumstances, the auditor may count these interviews toward\nsatisfying the requirement for both the applicable specialized staff interviews and random staff\ninterviews. In addition to the specialized staff listed above, there may be other staff who the auditor should\nspeak with in order to understand the facility\u2019s operations and to conduct a comprehensive\naudit. Although there are no specialized staff interview protocols for these staff positions,\nauditors are strongly encouraged to conduct interviews with mailroom staff, staff who develop\nand/or deliver training, the chaplain, classification staff, designated union representative or\nmembers of bargaining units (when applicable), information technology staff who can assist\nwith relevant data collection, and other positions as deemed necessary. Specialized staff interviews will vary in different settings. Depending on the size and\ncharacteristics of the facility, certain specialized staff roles envisioned in the PREA Standards\nwill not exist, and the auditor must determine which member(s) of the current staff to\ninterview. Additionally, staff in some facilities may be responsible for more than one of the\nspecialized staff duties. Therefore, more than one interview protocol may apply to an interview\nwith a single staff member. For example, if an auditor selects a nurse who conducts screenings\nfor risk of sexual victimization or abusiveness and who is employed through an organization\nthat contracts with the facility for medical services, the auditor should use three interview\nprotocols: Medical and Mental Health Staff, Volunteers and Contractors who Have Contact with\nInmates, and Staff who Perform Screening for Risk of Victimization and Abusiveness. Due to the diverse nature of specialized staff roles, and the need to combine or adapt the\nrelevant protocols when staff serve in multiple specialized roles, the time necessary to\ninterview these staff may range from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours; thus, auditors should be\nprepared to change the audit schedule as needed to accommodate these interviews.",

Auditors should plan to interview a diverse cross-section of both volunteers and contractors\nwho perform different roles in the facility such as religious, education, medical, mental health,\nprogramming, and maintenance. Auditors should conduct two to four interviews with\nvolunteers and another two to four interviews with contractors who have contact with inmates. Auditors should also conduct interviews with approximately two to four investigative staff, both\nat the facility and agency levels. Auditors are encouraged to interview more than one staff\nmember serving in other specialized roles as well, when deemed necessary and feasible. 56 Required Documentation when Staff Interview Requirements Are Not Met\nAuditors must make all reasonable efforts to meet the staff interviewing requirements outlined\nabove. The PREA Management Office recognizes, however, that it will not always be possible to\nachieve the requisite number of staff interviews due to a number of factors (e.g., number of\nstaff, facility operations). This may be particularly relevant for audits of smaller facilities where\nthere are fewer staff in the facility than the required number of interviews. If for any reason,\nregardless of facility size, an auditor does not conduct the minimum number of staff interviews\nprescribed above, he or she must thoroughly document this in his or her notes and include a\ndiscussion of why this was not possible in the audit narrative portion of the audit report. Effective Strategies for Interviewing Staff and Inmates\n\u2022 Use open-ended rather than \u201cyes/no\u201d questions. \u2022 Keep an open mind; listen carefully to everything the person is saying; and take the person\u2019s\ncomments seriously. \u2022 Work to establish a positive rapport and trust with the person being interviewed. \u2022 Be sure that the person being interviewed fully understands the purpose of the interview. \u2022 Schedule interviews to be minimally disruptive to facility operations, without cutting short individual\ninterviews or reducing the total number of interviews. \u2022 Request a private, quiet location to conduct interviews (e.g., classroom, attorney/client visitation\nroom). It is also preferable to identify an interview space where facility staff can observe the\ninterview through a window and to position the inmate with his or her back to the window. \u2022 Never allow other staff members or inmates to participate or sit in on an interview. \u2022 Never conduct group interviews. \u2022 Do not re-ask questions that have already been answered by the person being interviewed. \u2022 Take notes during each interview for use later when information that has been collected is\ntriangulated and the compliance determinations are made.

Accordingly, auditors should plan to spend a significant amount of time on\ndocumentation review during the onsite portion of the audit.

Such documents are self-selected\nand are not always an appropriate basis for making compliance determinations. Document Sampling In order to ensure that a representative sample of documents are selected for review, auditors\nshould start the document sampling process with a comprehensive list of inmates, staff, and\nrelevant records.

Once these lists are received, the auditor can begin selecting documents for review. Each\nauditor\u2019s strategy for documentation review during the onsite portion of the audit may vary 59 slightly; however, the purpose of this section is to guide auditors in reviewing an adequate\nsample of documents. Where there is a collection of records to review\u2014such as staff, contractor, and volunteer\ntraining records; background check records; supervisory rounds logs; risk screening and intake\nprocessing records; inmate education records; medical files; and investigative files\u2014auditors\nmust review a representative sample of each type of record. It is important to remember that\nmany types of records will require auditors to follow the document trail to determine whether\nor not the facility followed the required protocol in the PREA Standards; thus the number of\nrecords reviewed will vary by facility. For example, each inmate should have a screening record\nin his or her file. In cases where the screening record indicates that the inmate disclosed prior\nvictimization, the auditor must follow that inmate\u2019s records to determine, for example,\nwhether the facility provided the appropriate medical and/or mental health follow-up required\nunder Standard 115.81(a)/115.381(a) and provided appropriate housing and programming\nassignments pursuant to Standard 115.42/115.242/115.342. To facilitate this review process,\nauditors are encouraged to use the File Review Template, which is available on the Auditor\nPortal. As discussed in Chapter 15, auditors should review records that pertain to issues voiced by\ninmates and/or staff who submitted confidential correspondence to the auditor during earlier\nphases of the audit to determine whether such issues are reflected in the facility\u2019s\ndocumentation and, where applicable, the extent to which the facility followed the appropriate\npolicies and procedures in response to the identified issues or concerns. In addition to sampling the records, as described above, auditors must also conduct more\ntargeted sampling of documentation related to sexual abuse and sexual harassment allegations. For facilities with 20 or fewer sexual abuse and sexual harassment allegations in the past 12\nmonths, auditors should review at least 10 records that document the facility\u2019s response,\nincluding, but not limited to inmate grievances, risk screening records (including re-screening),\nhousing and programming information, first response records, investigative referrals (if\nappropriate), investigative files, pertinent medical and mental health records, retaliation\nmonitoring records, sexual abuse incident review records, and records of notification to\ninmates. In facilities that have more than 20 allegations of sexual abuse or sexual harassment in\nthe past 12 months, it is recommended that auditors review at least 10 records plus an\nadditional 10 percent of the remaining records over 20. For example, if a facility has 70\nallegations of sexual abuse or sexual harassment in the past 12 months, the auditor should\nreview a minimum of 15 investigative files. Additionally, while it is important to sample both\nsexual abuse and sexual harassment allegations, auditors should prioritize the review of sexual\nabuse allegations. Auditors should also ensure that they review a cross-section of cases that are pending,\nsubstantiated, unsubstantiated, and unfounded; criminal and administrative; and involving\nboth staff-on-inmate and inmate-on-inmate allegations.",

Investigations\nthat were just recently initiated before the auditor arrived onsite may not bear much\n60 substantive information for the purpose of assessing compliance with PREA. When identifying\nallegations for review, auditors should also be aware that such files may not be labeled using\nlanguage that is consistent with the Standards. For example, many facilities may not refer to\ncertain comments or behaviors that are sexually offensive as sexual harassment; therefore,\nauditors should work with the facility staff to understand how such incidents are catalogued in\ntheir records and also be prepared to search the investigative files and incident logs for other\ncommon words or phrases that may meet the definition of sexual harassment. Interviews with\ninformation technology staff can often surface helpful information regarding how the facility\ncategorizes and documents relevant allegations in electronic databases. Estimating Time to Complete the Onsite Audit The time to complete the onsite phase of the audit will vary depending on a number of factors\nsuch as facility type, population size, physical plant layout and size, facility organization, and\npreparedness level. Thus, the PREA Management Office does not prescribe a minimum amount\nof time auditors must spend during the onsite portion of the audit. Rather, the duration of the\nonsite audit must provide adequate time for the auditor to thoroughly evaluate compliance\nwith the PREA Standards in practice and assess the facility\u2019s commitment to sexual safety and\nzero tolerance for sexual abuse and sexual harassment. Auditors must use information obtained about the facility, coupled with the methodological\nrequirements articulated in this Handbook, to determine the appropriate number of days for\nthe onsite portion of the audit. To assist auditors with estimating the duration of the onsite\naudit based on the parameters above, Table 6 provides a breakdown of the estimated time to\ncomplete the required number of inmate and staff interviews based on facility type and\npopulation size.

These include the following:\n\u2022 115.403(a) \u2013 \u201cEach audit shall include a certification by the auditor that no conflict of\ninterest exists with respect to his or her ability to conduct an audit of the agency under\nreview.\u201d \u2022 115.403(b) \u2013 \u201cAudit reports shall state whether agency-wide policies and procedures\ncomply with relevant PREA standards.\u201d \u2022 115.403(c) \u2013 \u201cFor each PREA standard, the auditor shall determine whether the audited\nfacility reaches one of the following findings: Exceeds Standard (substantially exceeds\nrequirement of standard); Meets Standard (substantial compliance; complies in all\nmaterial ways with the standard for the relevant review period); Does Not Meet\nStandard (requires corrective action). The audit summary shall indicate, among other\nthings, the number of provisions the facility has achieved at each grade level.\u201d \u2022 115.403(d) \u2013 \u201cAudit reports shall describe the methodology, sampling sizes, and basis\nfor the auditor\u2019s conclusions with regard to each standard provision for each audited\nfacility, and shall include recommendations for any required corrective action.\u201d \u2022 115.403(e) \u2013 \u201cAuditors shall redact any personally identifiable inmate or staff\ninformation from their reports, but shall provide such information to the agency upon\nrequest, and may provide such information to the Department of Justice.\u201d The auditor\u2019s initial report to the facility is known as the interim report.

The Audit Instrument includes a report template that auditors are required to use to produce\nreports. 21 The report template standardizes audit reports, addresses the reporting\nrequirements in the PREA Standards, and prompts auditors to address each of the PREA\nStandards, including every provision and element in each Standard. For auditors using the\nOnline Audit System, the report template is integrated into the online audit platform and will\nbe auto-populated using the information entered by auditors throughout the audit process. Auditors are required to use the most up-to-date version of the report template included in the Audit\nInstrument. 21 64 In addition to conveying the auditor\u2019s findings for each of the PREA Standards, the auditor\u2019s\ninterim report must include the following elements:\n\u2022 Characteristics of the audited facility. In order to provide readers with a basic\nunderstanding of the facility\u2019s characteristics, operations, and some context for how the\nauditor applied the prescribed audit methodology and arrived at his or her compliance\ndeterminations for each Standard, the auditor must provide a brief narrative describing\nthe audited facility. This description should include information regarding the inmate\npopulation size and makeup, staff size, number and types of housing units, security\nlevels, facility operations, and age of the facility, among other characteristics. This\nnarrative should be brief, and auditors should not go into extensive detail regarding\nfacility characteristics that are unrelated to the PREA audit (e.g., reentry programming). Additionally, auditors should refrain from making generalized value statements about\nthe facility and staff; for example, \u201call staff were professional and accommodating,\u201d or\n\u201call staff were committed to PREA and inmate safety.\u201d Because in the vast majority of\ncases auditors will not have spoken with all staff or all inmates, such statements may be\ninterpreted as auditor bias. To make an objective assessment, it is critical that the\nauditor state facts based on precise observations with evidence to support them. PREA\nauditors must uphold a high standard of objectivity, and this should be reflected in the\naudit report. \u2022 Overview of audit methodology. As required by Standard 115.403(d), the report must\ncontain a description of the audit methodology for each phase of the audit such as\nsampling techniques used to select staff and inmates for interviews, the number and\ntypes of interviews conducted (including the exact number of inmates formally\ninterviewed), sampling techniques used to select documents for review onsite, auditor\nobservations during the site review, and outreach to community-based victim service\nproviders. It is recommended that the auditor provide a brief summary of this\ninformation in the narrative section of the audit report, followed by more detailed\ninformation on the methodology and evidence collected in the Standard-by-Standard\nreview. \u2022 Barriers to completing the audit. The report should document any obstacles or\nchallenges the auditor encountered at the facility such as any unwarranted delays in\naccessing areas of a facility, individuals, or facility records; any access that was\nprohibited; and any pressure from the facility or parent agency to ignore or understate\npolicies or practices that fall short of the PREA Standards.",

If there are contradictions in the evidence (i.e. one type of\nevidence supports compliance while another does not), the auditor must describe how\nhe or she resolved those discrepancies to reach a finding. \u2022 Noncompliance and corrective action. The interim report must identify deficiencies and\nrecommended corrective action steps. Following issuance of the interim report, the\nauditor will work collaboratively with the facility to develop a corrective action plan,\nspecific deliverables, timeframes, and steps the auditor will take to re-assess and verify\nthe facility\u2019s compliance at various stages throughout the process. \u2022 Transparency regarding the auditor and his or her employer.

Review of Auditor Tools for Phase Three of the PREA Audit\n\u2022\n\u2022 Auditor Compliance Tool\nAudit Report Template Phase Four: Corrective Action and Final Report\nNoncompliance and corrective action are normal and expected parts of the PREA audit. Recognizing there are several hundred specific requirements in the PREA Standards, it is\nexpected that very few confinement facilities will be in full compliance with all the PREA\nStandards without undergoing some corrective action. For this reason, the auditor\u2019s role goes\nbeyond identifying deficiencies in policy, procedure, and practice and includes recommending\ncorrective actions and serving as a guide to facilities and agencies as they make the changes\nnecessary to become fully PREA compliant. Noncompliance and Corrective Action\nIssuance of the interim report to the audited facility triggers a corrective action period, which\nmay last up to 180 days.

At the same time, auditors must be\nassertive and firm in identifying deficiencies and the actions needed to remedy those problems. While it is the agency\u2019s and the facility\u2019s responsibilities to implement new policies and\npractices, the auditor is a collaborator in that process by consulting with staff and\nadministrators, providing information and guidance, and directing administrators to seek\nadditional information and technical assistance available from the PREA Resource Center,\nwhere necessary.

Depending on the\nnature and extent of the deficiencies, auditors may have to employ a range of strategies to\nverify compliance. Remember that a change in policy often impacts the day-to-day practices\nwithin a facility and may require curriculum development and training to fully implement; thus,\neven seemingly minor changes to a policy may require more extensive verification methods. At the conclusion of the corrective action period, the audited facility should have taken all the\nsteps agreed upon with the auditor, and the auditor should have conducted all the necessary\nverification procedures.

As stated above, for each PREA Standard, auditors must determine whether the facility Exceeds\nStandard, Meets Standard, or Does Not Meet Standard, bearing in mind that if a facility is out of\ncompliance with any provision of a Standard, the facility is out of compliance with the entire\nStandard.

Why Objective, Thorough, High Quality Audit Reports Are Important An auditor\u2019s report constitutes the official record of the audit and its findings\u2014and in the case\nof the auditor\u2019s final report, the official public record. While the confinement agency is the\nauditor\u2019s client, a PREA audit is intended to inform a wide array of stakeholders, including\ninmates and their families; organizations that advocate on behalf of inmates; people employed\nin confinement facilities, their families, and the unions that represent them; elected officials in\nthe jurisdiction where the facility is located; the general public; and DOJ. Through the audit\nreport, a PREA auditor is speaking to all of these audiences. To be understandable and valuable, an auditor\u2019s report must describe the facility and audit\nprocess, findings about compliance with the PREA Standards, and the evidence upon which\neach finding is based. It is important that the audit report clearly and thoroughly describes the\nevidence relied upon to make all compliance determinations, such that a third party reading it\nwill understand how the auditor came to each conclusion. Auditors should also explain certain\nfrequently used terminology that may be unfamiliar to some readers (e.g., describe the\ndifferences between \u201cdisciplinary segregation,\u201d \u201cadministrative segregation,\u201d and \u201cprotective\ncustody\u201d). The audit report is also the primary source of information for understanding and resolving any\nissues or concerns that arise regarding the findings of a PREA audit. Therefore, auditors should\ntake care to ensure the audit findings are clearly and adequately supported and described in\nthe audit report. Finally, it is in an auditor\u2019s own best interests to produce strong audit reports. These documents\nwill become public and are a reflection of the auditor\u2019s professional standards, skill, and\nexpertise, and impact the reputation of the auditor.

This chapter will primarily discuss auditors\u2019 obligations for document\npreservation and retention, followed by a brief discussion of the audit appeal process. Documentation Retention The PREA Standards require not only that documentation be reviewed and used to make\ncompliance determinations, but they require auditors to retain and preserve all audit\ndocumentation and information relied upon to make the compliance determinations. Standard\n115.401(j) states, \u201cThe auditor shall retain and preserve all documentation (including, e.g.,\nvideo tapes and interview notes) relied upon in making audit determinations. Such\ndocumentation shall be provided to the Department of Justice upon request.\u201d An FAQ issued by\nthe DOJ PREA Working Group on March 24, 2014 states that all documentation must be\nretained by the auditor for 15 months following the issuance of the final report. 25\nThe DOJ PREA Working Group released additional guidance on March 18, 2015, which provides\nextensive detail on the scope of an auditor\u2019s requirements under Standard 115.401(j). 26\nAuditors are required to follow this official guidance in order to meet their obligations under\nthe Standard. Importantly, the guidance states that auditors are required to preserve and retain\n\u201c. . . both documentation relied upon in finding that a facility does not comply with a Standard,\nas well as documentation relied upon in finding that a facility does meet or exceed a Standard.\u201d Thus, regardless of an auditor\u2019s audit findings, he or she must be prepared to provide to DOJ,\nupon request, all of the evidence relied upon to make the compliance determinations for up to\n15 months following the issuance of the final report. This requirement includes all audit documentation, whether stored in hardcopy, electronic, or\ndigital formats (e.g., video footage of the facility). Auditors must take notes to document the\naudit process\u2014including notes for all interviews, site review observations, and documentation\nreview\u2014and auditor notes must be preserved and retained pursuant to the official DOJ\nguidance referenced above. An auditor\u2019s notes are critical for documenting the audit process\nand the evidence relied upon to make compliance determinations; thus, an auditor\u2019s notes\nshould be comprehensive, organized, and adequately convey the important points or key\ntakeaways from the interviews, observations of practice, or review of documentation. Auditors\nare strongly encouraged to develop a good note-taking system and to maintain that system for\nevery audit. If, upon request by DOJ, auditors are unable to provide their notes for any\ncomponent of the audit (i.e., interviews, observations, documentation review), they run the risk 25\n26 See the full FAQ here: www.prearesourcecenter.org/node/3220.

It is important to note that some types of documentation should be retained in their entirety,\nnamely logs or lists (e.g., logs of unannounced rounds, lists of all sexual abuse or sexual\nharassment allegations), whereas for other forms of documentation, like inmate records or\npersonnel files, auditors need only preserve and retain the applicable documents in the file.",

For policy and procedures documents, auditors may preserve and\nretain excerpts that are relevant to the Standard(s) they address. Standard 115.401(j) also gives DOJ the authority to request audit documentation from auditors,\nstating, \u201cSuch documentation shall be provided to the Department of Justice upon request.\u201d If\nrequested by DOJ, an auditor\u2019s documentation should be organized and complete so as to\nprovide a roadmap for DOJ to reconstruct an auditor\u2019s compliance determinations for each\nprovision of every Standard. As previously described, this documentation must include all the\nevidence relied upon to make a compliance determination, which includes an auditor\u2019s notes. Consistent with the guidance issued by the DOJ PREA Working Group, auditors who do not\ncomply with Standard 115.401(j) may be subject to disciplinary action by DOJ. The Agency\u2019s Right to Appeal\nStandard 115.405 provides agencies with the option to appeal any findings of an audit that they\nbelieve are incorrect. 27 The auditor who issued the findings under appeal has no role in the\nappeal process other than to provide documentation of his or her work or answer questions\nupon request by DOJ. Section VI. Audit Oversight The value and effectiveness of any PREA audit largely depends on the auditor\u2019s skills and\nthoroughness. This includes an auditor\u2019s understanding of the Standards, mastery of the audit\nmethodology, and the ability to help agencies and facilities to change in ways that lead to\nsuccessful implementation of the PREA Standards. As the primary means by which a facility\u2019s\ncompliance with the Standards is assessed by an objective third party, the PREA audit\nrepresents an important catalyst for meaningful PREA Standards implementation and adoption\nof zero tolerance cultures for sexual abuse and sexual harassment in confinement. In order to\naccomplish these goals and uphold the integrity of the PREA audit process, the PREA\nManagement Office has instituted the PREA Audit Oversight function. The purpose of Audit\nOversight is to promote high quality, reliable, objective, and comprehensive audits that hold\nagencies and facilities accountable for keeping individuals in their custody and care safe from\nsexual abuse and sexual harassment. 27 See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 115.405(a). 71 Audit Oversight begins with an assessment of auditors\u2019 performance and conduct that guides\nmany of the interventions employed under the oversight umbrella. The audit assessment serves\nas a diagnostic tool to tailor interventions and sanctions to the individual needs of and the\nchallenges identified with auditors\u2019 work. The assessment is also informed by auditors\u2019\nperformance in these interventions to form a continuous feedback loop of information that\nallows the PREA Management Office to proactively provide support to auditors, and respond\nwith appropriate sanctions when necessary.",

Based on the results of the audit assessment, there are four interventions that may be used by\nthe PREA Management Office to support auditors and critically review their work, including the\nQuality Improvement Program managed by the PREA Resource Center, an auditor peer review\nprogram, a disciplinary review of auditors who fail to meet the requirements of their auditor\ncertifications, and remediation. These interventions may impact an auditor\u2019s DOJ certification. A full description of these interventions and the audit assessment phase can be found in\nChapters 20\u201324 below. Audit Assessment\nAuditors are expected to comply with the PREA Standards that govern auditor conduct, as well\nas the auditor requirements articulated in the PREA Auditor Candidate Training, this Handbook,\nrequired auditor continuing education, and FAQs issued by the DOJ PREA Working Group. On a\nregular basis, the PREA Management Office uses information collected from auditors through\naudit reporting forms, audit reports, complaints submitted by third party sources, their\nperformance and engagement during oversight interventions (e.g., Quality Improvement\nProgram), and the requested audit documentation to evaluate an auditor\u2019s performance and\nidentify targeted interventions and/or sanctions that are responsive to the needs of and/or\ndeficiencies identified with the auditor\u2019s work. These interventions and sanctions may directly\nimpact an auditor\u2019s DOJ certification. The audit assessment phase of the audit oversight process is the starting point for all\ninterventions under the oversight umbrella and consists of a systematic, objective, and datadriven process for holding all auditors accountable for high standards of audit quality. The chapters below provide additional information on how the audit assessment phase\nconnects with each intervention, the nature of these interventions, and their potential\noutcomes. Quality Improvement Program The Quality Improvement Program is managed by the PREA Resource Center and is designed to\nserve as a proactive support mechanism for auditors. The core objectives of the Quality\nImprovement Program are to enhance auditors\u2019 technical skills and knowledge of the Standards\nthrough individualized technical assistance and guidance; develop targeted auditor training and\ncontinuing education resources that are responsive to common challenges identified through\nassistance to auditors; and identify and promote auditing best practices and lessons learned,\nwhich the PREA Resource Center regularly shares on the Auditor Portal. 72 Quality Improvement Process Because the goal of the Quality Improvement Program is to conduct proactive issue spotting\nand outreach to auditors, auditors may be identified for assistance in one of two ways: 1) Auditors may be referred to the Quality Improvement Program by the PREA\nManagement Office in cases where the audit assessment process (see Chapter 20)\nreveals minor deficiencies related to auditor conduct and/or practices.",

Once an auditor is identified for participation in the Quality Improvement Program, the PREA\nResource Center develops a tailored strategy to address any identified issues. The PREA\nResource Center will then provide the auditor with a description of the Quality Improvement\nProgram, information regarding any issues or concerns identified with the auditor\u2019s conduct\nand/or auditing practices, and recommendations for improvement. The level and type of\nassistance provided are determined on a case-by-case basis and are tailored to the needs of\neach auditor receiving assistance, which may include one or more of the following:\n\u2022 One-on-one assistance (via telephone, video conference, or email) with PREA Resource\nCenter staff regarding particular issues or concerns \u2022 Submission of the auditor\u2019s next audit report to the PREA Resource Center for review\nand feedback prior to the submission of the report to the audited facility \u2022 Additional education or training requirements \u2022 Testing to confirm knowledge, understanding, or skills Quality Improvement Program Outcomes\nResolution occurs when the auditor completes the action steps required by the PREA Resource\nCenter. The PREA Management Office may subsequently spot check the auditor\u2019s future audit\nreports and reporting form data in order to assess his or her level of improvement and\nadherence to guidance provided during the Quality Improvement Program. In cases where guidance is not being consistently integrated by an auditor, an auditor fails to\ncomplete the requirements provided by the PREA Resource Center, and/or an auditor\ndemonstrates persistent or recurring problems, these issues will be factored into the PREA\nManagement Office\u2019s audit assessment (see Chapter 20), and when taken together with other\nidentified issues with an auditor\u2019s body of work, may lead to disciplinary review by the PREA\nManagement Office (see Chapter 23). 73 Peer Review In peer review, an auditor\u2019s professional peers evaluate the extent to which the auditor\ncomplies with the requirements in the Standards and properly conforms to the principles and\nmethods of the PREA audit described in this Handbook. A team of two peer reviewers is\ncharged with conducting a rigorous examination of all the evidence and documentation relied\nupon by an auditor to determine the extent to which he or she has made accurate compliance\nfindings. The primary goal of peer review is to enhance the reliability and integrity of PREA\naudits, encourage high standards for audit quality, and promote accountability within the PREA\nauditor community.",

Peer Review Process The PREA Management Office oversees peer review and is responsible for making all final\ndecisions regarding the selection of both auditors for peer review and auditors to serve on peer\nreview teams, as well as the disposition of auditors following the completion of peer review. The PREA Resource Center is responsible for managing and coordinating the peer review\nprocess, with oversight by the PREA Management Office. An auditor will be selected to undergo a peer review based on the result of the PREA\nManagement Office\u2019s standardized audit assessment process (see Chapter 20). Once selected,\npeer reviewers are asked to assess an audit to determine whether: 1. The auditor collected and retained sufficient documentation. 2. The audit documentation and other relevant evidence support the auditor\u2019s compliance\nfindings. 3. The audit report conforms to the requirements articulated in the PREA Auditor\nCandidate Training, this Handbook, required auditor continuing education, and FAQs\nissued by the DOJ PREA Working Group. 4. The audit report complies with the PREA Standards that govern auditors, including:\na. \u201cEach audit shall include a certification by the auditor that no conflict of interest\nexists with respect to his or her ability to conduct an audit of the agency under\nreview.\u201d (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 115.403(a))\nb. \u201cAudit reports shall state whether agency-wide policies and procedures comply\nwith relevant PREA standards.\u201d (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 115.403(b))\n74 c. \u201cFor each PREA standard, the auditor shall determine whether the audited\nfacility reaches one of the following findings: Exceeds Standard (substantially\nexceeds requirements of standard); Meets Standard (substantial compliance;\ncomplies in all material ways with the standard for the relevant review period);\nDoes Not Meet Standard (requires corrective action). The audit summary shall\nindicate, among other things, the number of provisions the facility has achieved\nat each grade level.\u201d (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 115.403(c))\nd. \u201cAudit reports shall describe the methodology, sampling sizes, and basis for the\nauditor\u2019s conclusions with regard to each standard provision for each audited\nfacility, and shall include recommendations for any required corrective action.\u201d\n(28 C.F.R. \u00a7 115.403(d)) 5. The audit report exhibits excellent performance or auditing best practices.

A copy of the summary peer review report\nwill also be made available to the reviewed auditor. Peer Review Outcomes Determining outcomes and next steps for auditors who undergo a peer review is the sole\nresponsibility of the PREA Management Office.

As stated above, if the peer review findings indicate that an auditor\u2019s compliance\ndeterminations, application of the Standards, corrective action requirements, or other\nelements are significantly deficient, peer review may lead to a disciplinary review by the PREA\nManagement Office.

In some cases, the PREA Management Office may determine that remediation steps are more\nappropriate than requiring the auditor to proceed through the full disciplinary review process,\nand there are actions that the auditor can take to successfully address the concerns and issues\nthat were identified in the PREA Management Office\u2019s audit assessment (see Chapter 20). In\nother cases, the PREA Management Office may determine that a disciplinary review is\nwarranted without engaging in remediation steps. The disciplinary review process may impact\nan auditor\u2019s DOJ certification. Disciplinary Review Process Auditors placed on disciplinary review by the PREA Management Office will receive written\nnotice from the PREA Management Office that includes a description of the identified concerns\nand issues related to the auditor\u2019s work, any allegations of auditor misconduct, and detailed\ninstructions for proceeding through the disciplinary review process. Auditors under disciplinary review will generally be instructed to:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Provide a written response to the issues and concerns detailed in the Notice of\nDisciplinary Review issued by the PREA Management Office (including all relevant\nsupporting documentation) Submit the underlying audit documentation for one or more audits conducted by the\nauditor\nProvide a list of all upcoming audits",

If the PREA Management Office receives information indicating that an auditor has engaged in\ncriminal conduct, malfeasance, gross negligence, fraud, conflict of interest, or other unlawful\nbehavior that bears on an auditor\u2019s credibility or integrity, the PREA Management Office will\ndetermine next steps on a case-by-case basis, depending on the circumstances and the nature\nof the allegation. Where warranted, the PREA Management Office will refer the case to the\nappropriate local, state, or federal agency for investigation and disposition. Depending on the\nseverity of the allegation, the PREA Management Office may require the auditor to suspend all\nauditing activity pending the outcome of the investigation. Certain confirmed cases of serious\nauditor misconduct may result in immediate decertification. Refer to Chapter 28 for more\ninformation on disciplinary action by the PREA Management Office. 76 Disciplinary Review Outcomes The outcome of the disciplinary review process will vary depending on the nature and scope of\nthe issues identified.\n\u2022 Case Resolution. In cases where an auditor complies with all the requirements imposed\nby the PREA Management Office and is able to adequately address and remedy all the\nidentified issues, his or her case will be considered resolved.

Refer to Chapter\n24 for more information on remediation. \u2022 Disciplinary Action. Where auditors fail to adequately address the issues raised by the\nPREA Management Office or where there is sufficient evidence of serious auditor\nmisconduct or failure to meet auditor certification requirements, the PREA\nManagement Office may impose disciplinary action, up to and including suspension or\ndecertification. Additional information regarding decertification and suspension can be\nfound in Chapter 28. Remediation The objective of remediation is to provide an alternative to disciplinary review and/or\ndisciplinary action (i.e., suspension, decertification) in cases where auditors may have\ndemonstrated some deficiencies in their audit conduct and/or performance but do not meet\nthe threshold for disciplinary action. Depending on the nature and scope of the identified\ndeficiencies, the PREA Management Office may impose one or more conditions on an auditor,\nincluding, but not limited to, requiring the auditor to:\n\u2022 Provide an up-to-date and comprehensive list of all ongoing and scheduled audits \u2022 Participate in continuing education courses, practical skill-building exercises or training\nopportunities, and/or other means of improving technical competence, skills, and\nknowledge as directed by the PREA Management Office \u2022 Complete testing to confirm knowledge, understanding, or skills \u2022 Engage with the PREA Resource Center in ongoing support and technical assistance \u2022",

The PREA Management Office will closely monitor auditors to verify compliance with the\nrequirements imposed under remediation. Auditors who fail to comply with the remediation\nsteps may be subject to disciplinary action by the PREA Management Office. Impact of Audit Oversight\nThe Audit Oversight interventions employed by the PREA Management Office and the PREA\nResource Center (refer to Chapters 20\u201324) are not designed to challenge or overturn the\nfindings of auditors. Rather, the purpose of Audit Oversight is to evaluate auditor performance,\nprovide meaningful support and technical assistance to auditors to improve their auditing\npractices, and, where necessary, impose disciplinary action on auditors who fail to fulfill the\nrequirements of their PREA auditor certifications granted by DOJ. In such instances, Audit\nOversight may impact an auditor\u2019s DOJ certification. By nature of the Audit Oversight process, however, the PREA Management Office may identify\nauditing deficiencies such as serious misapplication or misinterpretation of one or more\nStandards, auditor misconduct, conflicts of interest, infidelity to the PREA audit methodology,\nand failure to meet the obligations for auditor conduct in the PREA Standards, among others,\nthat cast significant doubt on the accuracy of an auditor\u2019s findings. Thus, while an auditor\u2019s\ncompliance findings are considered final and will not be impacted as a result of the PREA\nManagement Office\u2019s Audit Oversight, there are other potential implications that should be\nconsidered by auditors. These considerations are detailed below. Impact on the Governors\u2019 Annual Certification Determination\nDOJ reviews all certifications of full compliance submitted by states, territories, and the District\nof Columbia, and seriously considers any issues related to auditor conduct and their\nimplications on the veracity of an auditor\u2019s compliance findings.

By way\nof example, if an agency has received findings of full compliance for all of its facilities but DOJ is\naware of an agency-wide policy that is out of compliance with the PREA Standards, this\nincongruity will be brought to the governor\u2019s attention and should be considered when\ndetermining whether to submit a certification or assurance to DOJ. The DOJ PREA Working Group issued formal guidance in February 2013 28 indicating that audits\nrepresent just one piece of information a governor can use to determine compliance with the\nStandards. Neither the PREA statute nor the Standards restrict the sources of information that\ngovernors may use in deciding whether to certify full compliance with the Standards. Thus, if a\nstate has passing PREA audits but the governor is in possession of information that contradicts 28 See the full FAQ here: www.prearesourcecenter.org/node/3277. 78 full compliance in those facilities, that information may impact the governor\u2019s ability to certify\nfull compliance with the PREA Standards. Additionally, where there is a PREA audit finding that is incongruent with an agency\u2019s or\nfacility\u2019s compliance, either in policy or practice, the auditor should be prepared to answer\nquestions from the audited agencies and facilities regarding his or her evaluation of compliance\nfor the Standard(s) in question. Impact on the Safety and Wellbeing of Inmates\nBeyond the ramifications that incongruent audit findings can have on a governor\u2019s certification\ndetermination, auditors\u2019 compliance determinations have real implications for the safety and\nwellbeing of inmates who are most vulnerable to sexual abuse and sexual harassment. It is\nDOJ\u2019s expectation and an auditor\u2019s responsibility to rigorously evaluate a facility\u2019s or agency\u2019s\ncompliance with each provision of every Standard. And where areas of noncompliance are\nidentified, it is the auditor\u2019s responsibility to work collaboratively with the facility on a\ncorrective plan that will put the facility on a path toward full compliance. Section VII. Maintaining, Losing, or Giving up Certification Voluntary Surrender of Certification\nAuditors may voluntarily surrender their certifications. To do so, auditors should notify the\nPREA Management Office via email at PREACompliance@usdoj.gov. This notification should\ninclude the auditor\u2019s name and contact information, including a current email address. An auditor\u2019s voluntary surrender of his or her certification will take effect on the date the\nnotification is received by the PREA Management Office from the auditor. The auditor\u2019s name\nwill then be removed from the list of certified auditors on the PREA Resource Center website. Auditors are not permitted to voluntarily surrender their certifications if they are currently\nunder contract to conduct one or more PREA audits. In limited circumstances, however, the\nPREA Management Office may allow an auditor to voluntarily surrender his or her certification\nwhile under contract for a PREA audit.

If an auditor has any in-progress\naudits for which he or she has completed the onsite portion, the auditor must immediately\nnotify the appropriate officials in the facility or agency of the pending expiration of his or her\ncertification and ask those officials for instruction regarding completion of the contracted tasks. If the officials from the agency or facility expect the auditor to complete the post-onsite audit\nwork, the auditor will remain authorized through his or her certification expiration date to\ncomplete the audit through the final report. If an auditor has an in-progress audit and believes\nhe or she will not be able to complete the final report by the auditor\u2019s certification expiration\ndate, the auditor must contact the PREA Management Office at PREACompliance@usdoj.gov to\nrequest authorization to conduct the post-onsite audit work beyond the certification expiration\ndate.
