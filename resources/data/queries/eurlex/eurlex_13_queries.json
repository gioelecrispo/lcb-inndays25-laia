(2) The EGF is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices), as laid down in Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (3). (3) On 13 April 2017, Greece submitted an application to mobilise the EGF, in respect of redundancies in 9 enterprises operating in the retail sector in the following regions: Attica, Eastern Macedonia, Thrace, Central Macedonia, Western Macedonia, Thessaly, Epirus, Western Greece, Central Greece, Peloponnese, Southern Aegean and Crete in Greece. It was supplemented by additional information provided in accordance with Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013. That application complies with the requirements for determining a financial contribution from the EGF as laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013. (4) In accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013, the application from Greece is considered admissible since the redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national economy. (5) The EGF should, therefore, be mobilised in order to provide a financial contribution of EUR 2 949 150 in respect of the application submitted by Greece. (6) In order to minimise the time taken to mobilise the EGF, this decision should apply from the date of its adoption, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1",
