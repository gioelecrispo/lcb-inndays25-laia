(2) The EGF is not to exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 150 million (2011 prices), as laid down in Article 12 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (3). (3) On 19 July 2017 Spain submitted an application to mobilise the EGF, in respect of redundancies in 5 enterprises operating in the manufacture of wearing apparel sector in the region of Galicia in Spain. It was supplemented by additional information provided in accordance with Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013. That application complies with the requirements for determining a financial contribution from the EGF as laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013. (4) In accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013, the application from Spain is considered admissible since the redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local economy. (5) The EGF should, therefore, be mobilised in order to provide a financial contribution of EUR 720 000 in respect of the application submitted by Spain. (6) In order to minimise the time taken to mobilise the EGF, this decision should apply from the date of its adoption, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1",
