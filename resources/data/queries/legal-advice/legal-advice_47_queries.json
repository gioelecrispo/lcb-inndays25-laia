SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS\n1) A cogeneration facility can also be a \u201cqualifying small power production\nfacility\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 168(e)(3)(B)(vi)(II). 2) XYZ\u2019s power facility is a \u201cqualifying small power production facility\u201d and thus\nthe equipment used in the facility is \u201c5-year property\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 168(e)(3)(B)(vi)(II). FACTS The taxpayer, XYZ, is a Business. The taxpayer produces A of Product a Period,\nwhich is approximately B of all of the Product produced in Location. In producing such\nC of Product, the taxpayer relies on its power production assets to generate electricity\nand steam used in its refining operations. In the early 1980s, the taxpayer used D Industrial turbine generators in its power\noperation which produced a total of E Megawatts. On Date 1, the taxpayer filed a \u201cselfcertification\u201d with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (hereinafter the \u201cFERC\u201d)\nthat its power operation was a qualified small power production facility within the\nmeaning of 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(17)(C). To date, the taxpayer has not filed any subsequent\ncertifications. The taxpayer began replacing the original Industrial turbine generators in Year 2. In Year 3, the taxpayer also replaced a boiler in its power operation that increased the\nplant\u2019s steam capacity. By Year 4, the taxpayer had completely replaced all D of its\noriginal turbine generators, its boiler, and all of its other equipment related to its power\noperation. 1 All statutory references are to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise expressly\nstated in this memorandum. POSTF-132138-11 -3- The taxpayer\u2019s power plant is, and has been, fueled from a Product F material\ncalled Fuel. The process begins when Product is brought into the plant where it is\nRefined. The Product F (the \u201cFuel\u201d) is combusted in the boilers and used to create\nsteam. High pressure steam is then channeled from the boilers to the generators and is\nused to turn the turbines. The turbines create the electricity used in the operation. Low\npressure steam from the same boilers is channeled to evaporators which are used to\nRefine. When the steam from the evaporator condenses, it is channeled back to the\nboilers as water and is subsequently boiled again. The system is what is referred to as\na \u201cclosed loop system.\u201d The power operation serves two purposes: (1) to generate electricity, and (2)\nRefinement. While the taxpayer produces its own power, the taxpayer is connected to\nthe power company\u2019s grid so that it can draw power to run its operations if needed. The\ntaxpayer sells any excess power production from its operation back to the power\ncompany grid.",

The\ntaxpayer sells any excess power production from its operation back to the power\ncompany grid. Since Year 2, the taxpayer has depreciated its power plant equipment and\nassociated assets under Asset Class 20.2 of Rev. Proc. 87-56, 1987-2 C.B. 674. That\nasset class provides a 18-year class life, and a 10-year recovery period under the\ngeneral depreciation system, for assets used in the production of raw sugar, syrup, or\nfinished sugar cane or sugar beets. Exam reviewed the taxpayer\u2019s power production\noperation and issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (a \u201cNOPA\u201d) that the power\nproduction plant and associated assets should be depreciated under Asset Class 00.4\nof Rev. Proc. 87-56 which provides a 22-year class life and a 15-year recovery period,\nunder the general depreciation system, for assets used in \u201cindustrial steam and electric\ngeneration and/or distribution systems.\u201d After Exam asserted its position in its NOPA,\nthe taxpayer changed its position and notified Exam that it was in fact entitled to classify\nthe power plant equipment and associated assets under \u00a7 168(e)(3)(B)(vi)(II), which\nprovides for a 5-year property classification with a 5-year recovery period under the\ngeneral depreciation system. An IRS Engineer determined that the Fuel used in the power facility met the\ndefinition of \u201cbiomass property\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 48(l)(15) (1990). The IRS engineer also\nstudied the taxpayer\u2019s power facility and opined that the power facility was a\n\u201ccogeneration facility\u201d within the meaning of 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(18). A cogeneration\nfacility is defined as \u201ca facility which produces (i) electric energy, and (ii) steam or forms\nof useful energy (such as heat) which are used for industrial, commercial, heating or\ncooling purposes.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(18)(A). A qualified cogeneration facility is a facility\nthat the FERC determines, by rule, meets such requirements (i.e. minimum size, fuel\nuse, and fuel efficiency) as the FERC prescribes, by rule. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(18)(B). The taxpayer agrees that the facility is a cogeneration facility, but claimed that it\nis also a qualified small power production facility. The taxpayer suggests that the two\ndefinitions are not mutually exclusive. The taxpayer claims that the type of fuel used in\nits power operation, combined with the size of the electricity output, make the facility a POSTF-132138-11 -4- small power production facility. The taxpayer adds that the self-certification filed with\nthe FERC in October of 1984 makes the facility \u201cqualified.\u201d Therefore, in determining\nwhether \u00a7 168(e)(3)(B)(vi)(II) applied, Exam questioned whether the power facility could\nbe, and was, a \u201cqualified small power production facility\u201d within the meaning of 16\nU.S.C. \u00a7 17(C). LAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 167(a) allows as a deduction, \u201ca reasonable allowance for the\nexhaustion, wear and tear of property used in a trade or business or held for the\nproduction of income.\u201d Section 168 is used to determine the amount and timing of the\ndepreciation deduction.",

Section 168(e)(3)(B)(vi)(II) provides that \u201c5-year\nproperty\u201d includes any property which is described in \u00a7 48(l)(15) (as in effect before the\ndate of the enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) and is a qualifying\nsmall power production facility within the meaning of section 16 U.S.C. 3(17)(C), as in\neffect on September 1, 1986. The relevant part of \u00a7 48(l)(15) (1990) (amended by the\nRevenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) defines Biomass Property as an organic substance\nthat is any synthetic solid fuel, which does not include coal (including lignite) or any\nproduct of such coal. Fuel, is an organic substance other than coal and is therefore property described\nin paragraph \u00a7 48(l)(15) (1990) (amended by the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990). The first requirement of \u00a7 168(e)(3)(B)(vi)(II) is thus satisfied. The next requirement is\nthat the property be part of a qualifying small power production facility within the\nmeaning of 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(17)(C). A qualifying small power production facility means a small power production\nfacility that the FERC determines, by rule, meets such requirements (including\nrequirements respecting fuel use, fuel efficiency, and reliability) as the FERC may, by\nrule, prescribe. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(17)(C). In other words, to be a qualified small power\nproduction facility the taxpayer\u2019s facility must be (1) a small power production facility\nand (2) must be qualified by the FERC. The first part of the definition is clearly\nexplained in parts (A) and (B) of 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(17). A small power production facility is a generating facility of 80 megawatts or less\nwhose primary energy is renewable (hydro, wind or solar), biomass, waste, or\ngeothermal resources. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(17)(A). The primary energy source is the fuel\nused for the generation of electric energy. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796(17)(B). Fuel is a type of\nbiomass and the taxpayer\u2019s operation is a generating facility of less than 80 megawatts. Accordingly, the taxpayer\u2019s facility appears to be a small power production facility. As to the qualification requirements, the FERC promulgated regulations that\nprovide a small power production facility is a qualifying facility if (1) the power\nproduction capacity is less than 80 megawatts, (2) the primary energy source of the\nfacility is biomass, waste, renewable resources, or any combination thereof, and (3) the\nfacility files a notice of self-certification with the FERC or files an application with the\nFERC for \u201cCommission Certification.\u201d 18 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 292.203(a); 292.204. The owner of POSTF-132138-11 -5- the facility can self-certify with the FERC by submitting a Form with the FERC. 18\nC.F.R. \u00a7 292.207. The taxpayer submitted its self-certification form in Date 1. At that\ntime, the taxpayer\u2019s facility met all of the above requirements to be a qualified small\npower production facility. Between Year 2 and Year 4, the taxpayer replaced all the equipment in the selfcertified facility.",

At that\ntime, the taxpayer\u2019s facility met all of the above requirements to be a qualified small\npower production facility. Between Year 2 and Year 4, the taxpayer replaced all the equipment in the selfcertified facility. Despite the replacement, a change in facts from those presented in a\nnotice of self-certification or an application for Commission certification does not mean\nthat the facility is no longer a qualified facility. Mesquite Lake Associates, Ltd., 63\nFERC \u00b6 61,351 (June 30, 1993). Whether the facility will continue to be certified after a\nchange in facts depends on whether the facility continues to satisfy the ownership and\ntechnical requirements for qualifying status found in the statute and the Commission\u2019s\nregulations. Id. Despite the replacement, the taxpayer\u2019s facility continued to satisfy the\nownership and technical requirements for qualifying status set forth in 18 C.F.R.\n\u00a7\u00a7 292.203; 292.204.2\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A\ncogeneration facility produces electricity and steam or forms of useful energy (such as\nheat) which are used for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes. 16 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 796(18)(A). A qualifying cogeneration facility is a cogeneration facility that the FERC\ndetermines, by rule, meets the requirements the FERC prescribed. 16 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 796(18)(B). The taxpayer agrees that its power operation is a qualified cogeneration\nfacility, however, the taxpayer disagrees that it is not also a qualified small power\nproduction facility. There is no rule in either 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796 or the associated regulations which,\nexpressly or impliedly, states that if a facility is a cogeneration facility it is excluded from\nthe definition of a small power production facility. In fact, in a 1996 Order concerning\ncertification the FERC ruled that, based on the facts presented, a facility could be both a\nqualified small production facility and a qualified cogeneration facility. Burney Forest\nProducts, 76 FERC \u00b6 62,263 (September 30, 1996). The facility at issue in the Order\nconsisted of two wood-fired boilers and an extraction/condensing steam turbine\ngenerator. Id. The thermal output of the facility was used to dry lumber as well as\ncreate electricity. Id. The wood used in the facility was considered biomass and the\nmaximum net electric power production capacity of the facility was 31.5 megawatts. Id. Since the fuel was a biomass and the size of the power production capacity was less\nthan 80 megawatts, the facility met the definition of a small power production facility. Id. Since the thermal output both created electricity and dried the lumber, it was also a\ncogeneration facility. Id.\n2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- POSTF-132138-11 -6- The definitions themselves suggest that the classifications are not mutually\nexclusive. The crux of the definition of a qualified small power production facility is the\nsize of the facility (based on power output) and the type of fuel used. The crux of the\ndefinition of a qualified cogeneration facility is the method in which the electricity is\nproduced and the efficiency standards of that method. Thus, a plain reading of 16\nU.S.C. \u00a7 796(17) and (18) suggests that a facility could be both a qualified small power\nproduction facility and a qualified cogeneration facility. 3",

Its facility\nproduces less than 80 megawatts of electricity. The taxpayer\u2019s facility is within the\ndefinition of a small power production facility. The taxpayer self-certified in Year 1 and\ntherefore the small power production facility is qualified. Accordingly, the equipment\nused in the taxpayer\u2019s qualified small power production facility is \u201c5-year property\u201d\npursuant to \u00a7 168(e)(3)(B)(vi)(II).
