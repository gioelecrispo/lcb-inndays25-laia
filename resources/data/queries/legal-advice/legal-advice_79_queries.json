CONCLUSIONS\n1. Legal fees incurred to obtain FDA approval to market and sell new generic drugs\nmust be capitalized pursuant to Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263-4(d)(1). 2. Legal fees incurred to defend title to patents and prevent the marketing and sale of\na competing generic drug must be capitalized to the patents whose validity is at\nissue pursuant to Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(9). Fees that are allocable to\nresolving whether valid patents would be infringed by the generic drug are not\nrequired to be capitalized. 3. Urquhart does not apply to the legal fees at issue in this case because they were\nincurred to obtain FDA approval to market or sell new generic drugs or to defend\nthe exclusivity provided by the patents and not to recover lost profits, and\nCorporation X is not in the business of patent licensing as was the taxpayer in\nUrquhart. 4. FDA-approved ANDAs are amortizable Section 197 intangibles that are\namortizable ratably over a 15-year period, beginning on the first day of the month\nthe FDA-approved ANDA is acquired, provided all applicable exclusionary\nperiods have expired and provided that the trade or business requirement is met. 5. For the cost recovery of the legal fees incurred to protect both patents and a\nFDA-approved NDA: 6. A. The fees are recovered by (1) dividing the fees pro rata among, and\ncapitalizing these fees into, the basis of the patents, and (2) depreciating\nthe patents under I.R.C. \u00a7 167 and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.167(a)-14(c)(4). B. Cost recovery commences beginning with the months in which the legal\nfees were incurred, with the recovery pro rata over the remaining useful\nlives of the assets to which the fees are capitalizable. C. The NDA holder\u2019s grant of a license under the patents to the defendant\ngeneric drug company does not impact the cost recovery of the legal fees. The annual cost recovery of the attorney fees that are capitalized to the ANDAs\nmust also be capitalized pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 263A. POSTF-136693-12\n7. 5 For the legal fees incurred with respect to Corporation X\u2019s ANDAs and protecting\nor perfecting patents relating to FDA-approved NDAs:\nA.

FACTS\nCorporation X is a--------------------------pharmaceutical company engaged in developing,\nmanufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing generic and brand name\npharmaceutical products. During the fiscal years at issue, Corporation X and its\nsubsidiary, Corporation Y incurred substantial amounts of attorney fees to obtain\nANDAs and to protect its NDAs. A. Marketing and Selling New Pharmaceutical Drugs in the United States Before Corporation X can market and sell new pioneer drugs1 in the United States,\nCorporation X must have FDA-approved NDAs. Similarly, to market generic versions of\nFDA-approved NDAs in the United States, Corporation X must have FDA-approved\nANDAs. 1. NDA and ANDA Procedures and Paragraph IV Certification In order to market or sell a new pioneer drug in the United States, significant safety and\nefficacy studies must be completed and a NDA must be submitted to and approved by\nthe FDA. See Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(a) (2012). The\nNDA application is the vehicle through which drug sponsors formally propose that the\nFDA approve a new pharmaceutical for sale and marketing in the U.S. The goals of the\nNDA are to provide enough information to permit a FDA reviewer to determine whether\nthe drug is safe and effective in its proposed use(s), whether the benefits of the drug\n1 Pioneer drugs refer to drugs \u201cthat have never before received FDA approval.\u201d FTC v. Watson Pharms.,\nInc., 677 F.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2012), cert. granted, 81 U.S.L.W. 3216 (Dec. 07, 2012). POSTF-136693-12 6 outweigh the risks, whether the drug's proposed labeling (package insert) is appropriate\n(and what it should contain), and whether the methods used in manufacturing the drug\nand the controls used to maintain the drug's quality are adequate to preserve the drug's\nidentity, strength, quality, and purity. 2 The NDA must disclose all patents that cover the\ndrug, with the NDA holder required to notify the FDA of all new patents that\nsubsequently cover the drug after the filing of the NDA. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.53 (2011). If\nthe FDA approves a NDA, \u201cit publishes the drug and patent information in a book called\n\u2018Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence and Evaluations,\u2019 commonly\nreferred to as the \u2018Orange Book.\u2019\u201d FTC v. Watson Pharms., Inc., 677 F.3d 1298, 1302\n(11th Cir. 2012), cert. granted, 81 U.S.L.W. 3216 (Dec. 07, 2012).",

Watson Pharms., Inc., 677 F.3d 1298, 1302\n(11th Cir. 2012), cert. granted, 81 U.S.L.W. 3216 (Dec. 07, 2012). To market a generic version of an already approved drug, the maker of that generic\ndrug must submit an ANDA to the FDA. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21\nU.S.C. \u00a7 355(j) (2012). ANDAs are subject to a streamlined process which allows the\nANDA applicant to piggyback on the safety and efficacy studies conducted for the\npioneer drug, and obtain FDA approval by showing that its generic drug is bioequivalent\nto a pioneer drug already approved by the FDA. FTC v. Watson Pharms., Inc., 677 F.\n3d at 1302. Once approved, the ANDA applicant may manufacture and sell the generic\ndrug.3\n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii) requires an ANDA applicant to provide certification that the\nANDA will not infringe on the patent rights of a third party. The four types of\ncertifications set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(I) through (IV) are as follows:\nParagraph I: Certain patent information on the drug has not been filed. Paragraph II: The original patent has expired. Paragraph III: The generic drug will not enter the market until the date on which\nthe patent will expire. Paragraph IV: The applicant believes its product or the use of its product does not\ninfringe on the third party\u2019s patents or such patents are not valid or\nenforceable. Assuming an ANDA meets all other requirements for FDA approval, an ANDA\napplicant\u2019s certification under paragraph (I) or (II) of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii) allows\n2 http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/Approval\nApplications/NewDrugApplicationNDA/default.htm (last visited December 21, 2012). 3 http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/Approval\nApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/default.htm (last visited December 18,\n2012). POSTF-136693-12 7 the FDA to approve the ANDA immediately. A certification under paragraph III of 21\nU.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii) means that the FDA \u201dapproval may be made effective on the\ndate certified under subclause (III),\u201d which refers to the certified date of patent\nexpiration. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(ii). Where an ANDA applicant relies on a certification under paragraph IV of 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii) (hereinafter referred to as a \u201cparagraph IV certification\u201d), the FDA may\napprove the ANDA after the following requirements have been met: The ANDA applicant provides the required notice to the NDA holder for\nthe referenced drug and all patentees of record for the listed patents that\nthe applicant has filed an ANDA application with a paragraph IV\ncertification (the \u201cparagraph IV notice\u201d) within 20 days of being notified by\nthe FDA that the ANDA has been accepted for filing. 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 355(j)(2)(B). If neither the patent holders nor the NDA holders bring an infringement\nsuit within 45 days from the date of the paragraph IV notice, the FDA may\napprove the ANDA. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(3). If a patent holder or NDA holder files a patent infringement lawsuit within\n45 days, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271, against the ANDA applicant, a\nstay generally prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA for 30 months. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(3).",

If a patent holder or NDA holder files a patent infringement lawsuit within\n45 days, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271, against the ANDA applicant, a\nstay generally prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA for 30 months. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(3). If the court rules on the validity of the patent before the expiration of the\n30-month period, the ruling will determine whether the FDA approves the\nANDA prior to the thirty months. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(3)(I) and (II). If the patent infringement litigation is still ongoing after the 30 months, the\nFDA may approve the ANDA, and both parties can market their product. Therefore, if the NDA holder timely files a lawsuit, the FDA cannot approve the ANDA\nuntil the earliest of the following occurs: (1) all patents covering the drug have expired;\n(2) there is a final determination all patents are invalid or not infringed by a court; or (3)\nthe 30-month stay expires. See Federal Trade Commission, Generic Drug Entry Prior\nto Patent Expiration: An FTC Study, p. 39 (July 2002) (source of paraphrased\nsummation). 2. 180-Day Exclusivity Federal law encourages drug manufacturers to file ANDAs with paragraph IV\ncertifications by providing a 180-day \u201dexclusivity period\u201d set forth in 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv). See F.T.C. v. Watson Pharms., Inc., 677 F.3d at 1303. POSTF-136693-12 8 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) provides that the first generic drug applicant to file an ANDA\ncontaining a paragraph IV certification is awarded 180 days of marketing exclusivity. During that time, the FDA may not approve a subsequently filed ANDA that challenges\na patent for the same drug product. Only the first ANDA applicant may market or sell\nthe generic product during the 180-day exclusivity period. The 180-day exclusivity\nperiod commences on the earlier of: (1) when the generic manufacturer commences\ncommercial marketing; or (2) when a court decision finds the patents have not been\ninfringed or are invalid. The 180-day exclusivity period provided in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) is a significant\nincentive for an ANDA applicant to file a paragraph IV certification. An ANDA applicant\nwho successfully obtains 180-day exclusivity is able to gain dramatic financial benefits\nand market share because their generic version of the patented drug is the only one on\nthe market. B. Fees Incurred with Respect to Certain Lawsuits The Service plans to issue a revised notice of proposed adjustments (NOPA) to\nCorporation X, proposing to change Corporation X\u2019s method of accounting for the\nANDAs and one NDA addressed herein by disallowing deductions for the attorney fees\nincurred, and requiring the fees be capitalized on an ANDA-by-ANDA and patent-bypatent basis. The Service plans to suspend the audit of the attorney fees incurred for all\nother ANDAs and NDAs, and to propose Commissioner-initiated changes to\nCorporation X\u2019s method of accounting in the next cycle on an ANDA-by-ANDA and\npatent-by-patent basis, as discussed further in the Law and Analysis section, below.",

The ANDAs and the NDA addressed herein, and the lawsuits relative to said\napplications that gave rise to the fees that will be the subject of the revised NOPA are\naddressed below, grouped by the name of the primary third party in the lawsuits. In the\nfirst six groups, patent and NDA holders sued Corporation X because Corporation X\nfiled ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications (\u201cANDA fees\u201d). In the last lawsuit,\nCorporation X, as an NDA holder, sued an ANDA applicant who filed an ANDA with a\nparagraph IV certification (\u201cNDA fees\u201d). 1. Entity Y v. Corporation X -------------------------a. Short Summary Re: Entity Y Corporation X developed a generic drug to compete with the branded pioneer drug\ncalled Drug #1. Entity Y holds the FDA-approved NDA for Drug #1 and owns the\npatents cited in the Orange Book relative to Drug #1 . After Corporation X submitted its ANDA requesting FDA approval to sell a generic\nversion of Drug #1 prior to the expiration of the patents covering Drug #1, Entity Y sued\nCorporation X based on the ----- patents listed in the Orange Book. Entity Y later filed a POSTF-136693-12 9 second suit against Corporation X -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.

Rather, pursuant to\n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A), based on Corporation X\u2019s filing an ANDA with a Paragraph IV\ncertification, the parties placed at issue whether Entity Y\u2019s patents were valid and, if\nthey were, whether Corporation X infringed those patents. Entity Y requested, pursuant\nto 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(4)(A), that the effective date of Corporation X\u2019s ANDA be moved\nback until the last of Entity Y\u2019s patents expired. Entity Y\u2019s pleadings also requested a\ndeclaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 that Corporation X would infringe Entity Y\u2019s\npatents if it commercialized its generic version of Drug #1. Both parties requested relief\nunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285, which permits the court to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to\nthe prevailing party. The ----- lawsuits were ongoing as of the end of Year 3, the last year at issue herein.

Corporation X v Entity AI Some of the attorney fees at issue in this case were incurred in ANDA litigation\nregarding the branded drug Drug #8.

The FDA approved Corporation X\u2019s NDA for\nDrug #8 in Year 8, and Corporation X began production of the drug. In Year 2, Entity AI notified Corporation X that Entity AI filed ANDA One with a\nparagraph IV certification to obtain FDA approval to market and sell a generic version of\nDrug #8 prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. Entity AI\u2019s notice asserted that\nCorporation X\u2019s ---- patents listed in the Orange Book for Drug #8 were invalid, and that\nthe older ----- patents so listed were not infringed.",

Corporation X\u2019s Arguments that the Legal Fees at Issue Are Deductible\n1. ANDA Attorney Fees Corporation X asserts that \"[t]he defense fees [it] incurred to defend actions for patent\ninfringement did not facilitate obtaining an ANDA and thus are deductible as ordinary\nand necessary business expenses under section 162.\" Corporation X\u2019s Year 6 letter in\nresponse to the Form 5701 on capitalization of attorney fees (\u201cCorporation X\u2019s Position\nLetter\u201d), p. 4. Corporation X makes three arguments in support of its assertion. First,\nCorporation X argues that \u201cthe defense attorney fees did not have their origin in\nfacilitating the creation of an ANDA\u201d so are not capitalizable. Id. p. 6. Second,\nCorporation X argues that legal fees are deductible and that Urquhart v. Commissioner,\n215 F.2d 17 (3rd. Cir. 1954), establishes that legal fees incurred relative to patent\ninfringement litigation are deductible. Id., p. 4. Third, Corporation X argues \u201cthe Service\nincorrectly analyzes the facilitative test [in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)]\u201d. Id., p. 7.\na. Origin of the Claim Corporation X argues: The origin of the patent infringement litigation is not the filing of an ANDA,\nbut rather the infringement or intent to infringe on another\u2019s patent through\nmanufacturing, selling or marketing a generic product. Id., p. 4.\nCorporation X contends that the infringement is \u201cnot related to the ANDA submission.\u201d Id., p. 6.

Rather, the ANDA submission is mutually exclusive\nfrom the patent infringement litigation. A Taxpayer may lose the patent\ninfringement lawsuit and still receive approval from the FDA for its ANDA POSTF-136693-12 17 (albeit with a delayed effective date). Or, the FDA may approve the ANDA\nafter the expiration of the 30-month stay even if the patent infringement\nlitigation is still ongoing and the generic manufacturer has the option of\nlaunching the product \u201cat risk\u201d of losing the patent infringement lawsuit. Id., pp. 7-8.\nCorporation X also asserts that the FDA considers only bioequivalence before\napproving an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification. Thus, it concludes the legal fees\ncannot facilitate the FDA approval of the ANDA. Id., p. 8.\nAs further support, Corporation X also argues the origin cannot be the ANDA because\nthat would be the result from looking at the first event in time, in disregard of Boagni v.\nCommissioner, 59 T.C. 708 (1973), acq. 1973-2 C.B. 1, and Santa Fe Pacific Gold Co.\nand Subsidiaries v. Commissioner, 132 T.C. 240 (2009).\nb. Deductibility Notwithstanding the Capital Origin Corporation X argues that legal fees are generally deductible, relying on Commissioner\nv. Tellier, 383 U.S. 687 (1965) and Kornhauser v. Commissioner, 276 U.S. 145 (1928). Corporation X asserts that\nas long as legal fees paid in connection with litigation arise out of the\noperation of a taxpayer's trade or business, they should generally be\ndeductible . . . . See, e.g., Vanderbilt v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1957235, . . . Helvering v. Hampton, 79 F.2d 358 (9th Cir. 1935) . . . . Id. p. 5.\nCorporation X further argues that attorney fees resulting from patent infringement\nlitigation are specifically deductible, relying on Urquhart, supra. Id., p.4.\nc. the -4(e) regulation Corporation X agrees that Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)(1)(I) requires that amounts paid\nto facilitate the creation of an intangible must be capitalized \u201cif the amount is paid in the\nprocess of investigating or otherwise pursuing the transaction.\u201d Id., p.6. Corporation X\ndoes not address the meaning of \u201cfacilitate\u201d in the context of separate and distinct\nintangibles. However, Corporation X argues \u201cthe Service incorrectly analyzed the facilitative test\u201d, by\napplying a \u201cbut for\u201d test. Id., p. 7. Corporation X argues that \u201cbecause FDA approval of\nan ANDA is not contingent on the patent infringement litigation, the attorney fees\nincurred in the litigation process are not facilitative to obtaining the ANDA and are not\nrequired to be capitalized under section 263(a).\u201d Id., p. 4.

Id., p. 8. Corporation X argues the example in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)4(d)(9)(i) where \u201cU\u201d claimed \u201cR\u201d stole technology from \u201cU\u201d narrows the regulation so that\nit cannot apply, relying on J.I. Case Co. v. U.S., 91 Ct. Cl. 144 (1940). Corporation X\nalso argues that a claim of invalidity is not a challenge to ownership, again citing\nUrquhart. LAW AND ANALYSIS\nI.R.C \u00a7 162(a) provides, in general, that \u201c[t]here shall be allowed as a deduction all the\nordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on\nany trade of business, . . .\u201d However, I.R.C. \u00a7 263(a) provides, in general, that no\ndeduction shall be allowed for any amount paid out for new buildings or for permanent\nimprovements or betterments made to increase the value of any property or estate. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4 provides rules for determining when costs relating to intangible\nassets must be capitalized. Indopco specifically addressed the interplay between the general rules of \u00a7\u00a7 162 and\n263 as follows: In exploring the relationship between deductions and capital expenditures,\nthis Court has noted the \u201cfamiliar rule\u201d that \u201can income tax deduction is a\nmatter of legislative grace and that the burden of clearly showing the right\nto the claimed deduction is on the taxpayer.\u201d The notion that deductions\nare exceptions to the norm of capitalization finds support in various\naspects of the Code. Deductions are specifically enumerated and thus\nare subject to disallowance in favor of capitalization. See \u00a7\u00a7 161 and 261. Nondeductible capital expenditures, by contrast, are not exhaustively\nenumerated in the Code; rather than providing a \u201ccomplete list of\nnondeductible expenditures,\u201d \u00a7 263 serves as a general means of\ndistinguishing capital expenditures from current expenses. 503 U.S. at 84 (1992) (citations omitted, emphasis added). Based on general capitalization principles articulated in Lincoln Savings and\nIndopco, capitalization is the norm, with an expenditure that creates an asset or\nenhances a separate and distinct asset specifically capitalizable. However, an POSTF-136693-12 19 expenditure may still be capitalizable even if it does not create or enhance a separate\nand distinct asset. The treatment of legal fees is determined based upon the nature and character of the\nunderlying claim. Whether the nature and character of an expense related to an\nintangible asset results in capitalization is determined under Treas. Reg. 1.263(a)-4.\nUnited States v. Gilmore, 372 U.S. 39, 49 (1963), states that \u201cthe origin and character of\nthe claim with respect to which an expense was incurred, rather than its potential\nconsequences upon the fortunes of the taxpayer, is the controlling basic test of\nwhether the expense . . . is deductible or not . . .\u201d.

Woodward v. Commissioner, 397 U.S. 572 (1970). The Woodward Court\nexplained that Gilmore \u201crejected a test that looked to the consequences of the litigation,\nand did not even consider the taxpayer\u2019s motives or purposes in undertaking defense of\nthe litigation, but rather examined the origin and character of the claim against the\ntaxpayer, . . . . \u201c 397 U.S. at 578. The origin of the claim test is an objective inquiry to\ndetermine the origin and character of the claim from which the litigation proximately\nresulted, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances; it is not a test\ndependent on the formal titles to pleadings. I. ANDA Applicant Legal Fees The legal fees at issue originated in Corporation X\u2019s actions to create capital assets,\nFDA-approved ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications to allow Corporation X to market\nand sell its generic drugs before the expiration of the patents covering the FDAapproved brand name drugs. The ANDA fees at issue originated in Corporation X\u2019s\nattempts to enhance or create separate and distinct intangibles because ANDAs with\nparagraph IV certifications are separately transferrable. A FDA-approved ANDA with a\nparagraph IV certification is more valuable than the other types of ANDAs, e.g., an\nANDA with a paragraph III certification. ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications that are\nawarded a 180-day period of exclusivity are more valuable than ANDAs with paragraph\nIV certifications without such exclusivity. See Addendum A, \u00a7 2, attached (addressing\nthe regulatory rules that establish ANDAs and the180-Day exclusivity periods are\nseparately transferrable, and that a 180-day period of exclusivity can provide a return on\ninvestment of 1000%). Corporation X argues such determinations should not be made because the origin of\nthe fees is the litigation, itself, not the creation of new assets. However, this view is not\ncomplete. The attorneys\u2019 fees spent on litigation are part of a larger process of POSTF-136693-12 20 Corporation X\u2019s pursuit of FDA-approved ANDAs, approval needed to market and sell\nits generic drugs in the United States. This approval is an intangible asset under the\nregulations. The fees facilitate the creation of this intangible asset and thus are\nrequired to be capitalized. Corporation X further argues to support its assertion that the origin is the litigation that\nthe only difference between patent infringement suits where plaintiffs seek to recover\nlost profits and the lawsuits at issue is mere timing, so the origin cannot be Corporation\nX\u2019s actions to obtain new assets. However, timing for generic drugs determines the\nvalue the FDA approval brings \u2013 the earlier filed the more valuable, especially if\nCorporation X obtains first filer status so it gets a 180-Day exclusivity award. If timing\nwas not important, Corporation X would have waited rather than incur the fees at issue.",

Novopharm, Ltd., 110 F.3d 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1997),\nsupports Corporation X\u2019s position that the origin is the infringement. Corporation X errs. Glaxo confirms \u201can action brought under \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A) is based solely upon the filing of\nan ANDA. . . .\u201d 110 F.3d at 1567. In the cases in which Corporation X is pursuing an\nANDA, each claim in each lawsuit at issue asserted patent infringement pursuant to 35\nU.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A). Thus, Glaxo supports the Service\u2019s position the claims\noriginated in the creation of new ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications. Corporation X also argues that because the patent holder bears the burden of proving\ninfringement, that such, somehow, changes the origin of the claim analysis as if\nCorporation X was being sued for lost profits so the fees are deductible. Who bears the\nburden of proof does not alter the origin of the claim analysis. Moreover, \u201c[w]hile\npersons challenging the validity of a patent in litigation bear the burden of defeating a\npresumption of validity, this presumption is intended merely as a procedural devise and\nis not a substantive right. . . .\u201d In re K-DUR Antitrust Litigation, 686 F.3d 197, 214 (3rd\nCir. 2012). Corporation X argues that, if the 30-month stay expired, it could commercialize its\nANDA if approved by the FDA so the origin of its lawsuits cannot be creating ANDAs. That defies reason; Corporation X was seeking FDA approval prior to patent expiration,\nwith delay until patent expiration a bad result. But, the result (consequence) does not\nimpact the origin. Woodward, 397 U.S. at 578. POSTF-136693-12 21 Corporation X also argues the FDA is not a party to the lawsuits and can approve the\nANDAs regardless of the outcomes so that the origin cannot be the ANDA. Corporation\nX ignores the broader transaction and the other possible outcomes. While it is possible\nthat an ANDA could be granted subject a protracted patent litigation, what is certain is\nthat in every case, under the FDA regulations that apply, once the lawsuits were filed\nwithin 45 days, the FDA cannot approve the ANDAs until the 30-month stay is up,\nsubject to the outcome of the litigation. Delaying approval allows the NDA holder to\nhave a longer period of exclusive marketing, and frustrates what Corporation X seeks \u2013\nimmediate entry into the marketplace.

Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(c)(1). While \u201cpurchase or similar transaction\u201d is not defined in the\nregulations, reading the -4 regulations as a whole, the regulatory scheme would treat the ANDAs at issue\nas created, not acquired, because the ANDAs were, for example, not acquired from another\npharmaceutical company for consideration. 5 To date, no guidance has been published requiring the capitalization of expenditures with respect to\nintangibles that must be capitalized based solely on future benefit. POSTF-136693-12 (v) 22 An amount paid to facilitate (within the meaning of\nparagraph (e)(1) of this section) an acquisition or\ncreation of an intangible described in paragraph\n(b)(1)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section.

The scope of the word \u201cfacilitate\u201d as used in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4 is described in\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)(1)(i), which states:\n(e) Transaction costs--(1) Scope of facilitate--(i) In general. Except\nas otherwise provided in this section, an amount is paid to facilitate\nthe acquisition or creation of an intangible (the transaction) if the\namount is paid in the process of investigating or otherwise\npursuing the transaction. Whether an amount is paid in the\nprocess of investigating or otherwise pursuing the transaction is\ndetermined based on all of the facts and circumstances. In\ndetermining whether an amount is paid to facilitate a transaction,\nthe fact that the amount would (or would not) have been paid but for\nthe transaction is relevant, but is not determinative. An amount paid\nto determine the value or price of an intangible is an amount paid in\nthe process of investigating or otherwise pursuing the transaction. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)(1)(i) (emphasis added). The term \u201ctransaction,\u201d as used above, is also clearly defined in the regulations, as\nfollows:\n(3) Transaction. For purposes of this section, the term\ntransaction means all of the factual elements comprising an\nacquisition or creation of an intangible and includes a series of\nsteps carried out as part of a single plan. Thus, a transaction\ncan involve more than one invoice and more than one intangible. For example, a purchase of intangibles under one purchase\nagreement constitutes a single transaction, notwithstanding the fact\nthat the acquisition involves multiple intangibles and the amounts\npaid to facilitate the acquisition are capable of being allocated. . . .\nTreas.

The costs were incurred \u201cin the process\u201d of \u201cotherwise pursuing\u201d not\nsimply FDA approval of ANDAs, but FDA approval of ANDAs with paragraph IV POSTF-136693-12 24 certifications \u2013 a right to market and sell an approved generic drug before the expiration\nof the patents covering the branded drugs, and by filing early, possibly with a 180-day\n(six-month) exclusivity period. The entire patent litigation takes place within a\nframework created by the FDA regulations, which unequivocally confer standing 6 on the\npatent holder, and require that the ANDA applicant advise the patent holder of the\npending ANDA application. Because the legal fees were incurred in taking one of the\ncustomary or expected steps in the process of acquiring such ANDAs, i.e., defending a\nlawsuit brought pursuant to the artificial act of infringement of filing an ANDA with a\nparagraph IV certification with the FDA, the fees are costs paid in otherwise pursuing\nthe transaction. Accordingly, the ANDA fees facilitate creation of an intangible asset\nand must be capitalized. Corporation X\u2019s Position Letter argues that its fees did not facilitate obtaining ANDAs\nwith paragraph IV certifications because it did not need to defend itself if it filed a\ndifferent type of ANDA and/or Corporation X could have commercialized its generic\ndrugs after the 30-month stay expired regardless of the outcome of the lawsuits. First, Corporation X\u2019s argument fails to acknowledge that Corporation X was not merely\nseeking FDA approval of ANDAs; Corporation X was creating/obtaining ANDAs with\nparagraph IV certifications to market and sell approved generic drug prior to the patents\non the branded drugs expiring and, if it did win the proverbial \u201crace to the court-house\nsteps\u201d, market and sell the drugs without competition from other generic drugs for sixmonths. The actions (steps) that Corporation X took that gave rise to the fees at issue\nwere all part of the required process \u2013 a single transaction under Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.263(a)- 4(e)(3), which provides that for purposes of Treas.

Corporation X\nargues \u201cbut for\u201d its paragraph IV certifications, it would not have been sued, so its fees\ndid not facilitate acquiring its ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications. However,\nCorporation X was trying to obtain ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications. Thus, while\nit is true that if Corporation X did not obtain new assets it would not incur the cost of\nobtaining new assets, that says nothing about what Corporation X did do, or the fact\nCorporation X did incur the legal fees at issue.

Commissioner, 114 T.C. 458, 471 (2000) (holding that legal fees incurred in\ndefending against anti-trust had their origin in the taxpayer\u2019s acquisition transaction). Moreover, the result of a \u201cbut-for\u201d test in this situation is not dispositive. Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)(1)(i) specifically states that \u201c[i]n determining whether an amount is paid\nto facilitate a transaction, the fact that the amount would (or would not) have been paid 6 We have no opinion on whether standing would exist otherwise. The point is merely that the litigation is\npart of the ANDA application process. POSTF-136693-12 25 but for the transaction is relevant, but is not determinative. Thus, even if the taxpayer\u2019s\nargument was well-taken, it would not resolve the issue. Third, the argument that the ANDA fees were not necessary to create the intangible,\nand that therefore they do not have to be capitalized, is meritless. If costs are incurred\nto pay for a reasonable step taken in pursuit of the intangible, they are part of the series\nof steps that are taken in pursuit of the intangible, comprise the transaction described in\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)(3), and must be capitalized. For example, the buyer of a\nwarehouse to hold inventory need not obtain an appraisal of the warehouse before\npurchasing it. But if the buyer does get an appraisal in order to determine the amount of\nmoney it is willing to pay for the warehouse, then the cost of the appraisal must be\nadded to the cost of acquiring the warehouse and capitalized. In the present case, the\ndefense of the infringement lawsuits predictably prompted by the filing of a paragraph\n(IV) certification ANDA are steps customarily taken by seekers of intangible rights\nobtained through the ANDA process, and thus must be capitalized. The two events, the filing of the ANDAs with paragraph IV certifications and the defense\nof the patent infringement lawsuit, cannot be separated because they were a part of a\nseries of steps described in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(e)(3) undertaken in the pursuit of\na single plan to create an intangible. Because the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by\nCorporation X were directly associated with, and were incurred in pursuit of, the\nintangibles sought, the fees facilitate the creation of the intangible and must be\ncapitalized under I.R.C. \u00a7 263(a). Accordingly, based on the facts and circumstances, the fees facilitated the creation of\nANDAs with paragraph IV certifications. Accordingly, the attorney fees Corporation X\nincurred that are the subject of this advice must be capitalized because they were\nincurred to facilitate Corporation X obtaining the FDA-approved ANDAs that granted it\nthe right to market and sell its ANDA products in the United States.

Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(9) (the \u201c-4(d)(9) regulation\u201d) provides:\n(i) In general. A taxpayer must capitalize amounts paid to another party to\ndefend or perfect title to intangible property if that other party challenges\nthe taxpayer's title to the intangible property. ***\n(iii) Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph\n(d)(9):\nExample. Defense of title. R corporation claims to own an exclusive patent\non a particular technology. U corporation brings a lawsuit against R,\nclaiming that U is the true owner of the patent and that R stole the\ntechnology from U. The sole issue in the suit involves the validity of R's\npatent.

Because X's title to its copyright is not in\nquestion, X's action against Y does not involve X's defense or perfection of title to\nintangible property.

Corporation X argues the -4(d)(9) regulation cannot apply to its NDA fees because the\nexample in the -4(d)(9) regulation is not applicable to the Corporation X v. Entity AI\nlitigation because the ownership of the patent is not disputed. First, the example is just\nthat, an example, which does not limit the -4(d)(9) regulation to that one set of facts. Second, the claims in the Corporation X v Entity AI lawsuit parallel the example in the\nregulation. Corporation X claimed to own exclusive rights to the inventions the subject\nof the patents listed in the Orange Book for Drug #8, and Entity AI claimed Corporation\nX does not own exclusive rights to the inventions the subject of the patents listed in the\nOrange Book. The fact that Entity AI does not allege Corporation X stole its inventions,\nis a distinction without a difference since who owns the right to exclude is clearly at\nissue. Further, unlike the copyright in example Treas.

This is because patents are statutorily-granted monopolies that just\nconfer on the patentee the right to exclude others from the unauthorized making, using\nor selling of an invention. See Bloomer v. McQuewan, 55 U.S. 539, 549 (1852) (A\npatent grants the patentee \u201cthe right to exclude everyone from making, using or vending\n[selling] the thing patented, without the permission of the patentee.\u201d); Waterman v.\nMackenzie, 138 U.S. 252, 255 (1891) (in order to sue an infringer the plaintiff must\nhave the exclusive right to make, use, and vend). See also Raymond T. Nimmer and\nJeff Dodd, Modern Licensing Law, \u00a7 9:21 (addressing the concept a nonexclusive\nlicense is merely a promise to not sue for using, making or selling a patented invention). When Entity AI answered Corporation X\u2019s Complaint and claimed ---- of Corporation X\u2019s\npatents were invalid, Entity AI was, in essence, alleging Corporation X did not own the\nright to exclude anyone from using, making or selling the inventions the subject of the\npatents. Corporation X\u2019s Complaint and Amended Complaint alleged to the contrary,\nclaiming Corporation X did own the right to exclude others from using, making and\nselling.

The infringement statute Corporation X brought the\nsuit pursuant to, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A), does not allow for the recovery of lost profits\nif the generic drug was not commercialized.

What Corporation X was alleging is that its right to exclude was so broad\nthat if Entity AI commercialized it generic drugs Entity AI would infringe. Thus, the\ncosts allocable to determining whether patents are infringed (as opposed to valid) are\nnot required to be capitalized by 1.263(a)-4(d)(9). Accordingly, the fees relating to defending title to the ---- patents originated in protecting\nor perfecting title to the patents, the fees originated in a capital transaction and must be\ncapitalized. However, the fees relating to determining whether valid patents have been\ninfringed are not required to be capitalized. III. Recurring Fees Cannot Override the Capital Origin Corporation X argues, as an alternative, that legal fees are deductible as ordinary and\nnecessary expenses regardless of the capital origin, apparently because they recur. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4 contains exceptions for de minimis expenditures, short lived\nassets, and employee compensation, but does not contain an exception for recurring\nexpenditures that are otherwise required to be capitalized. This argument is without\nmerit. This position was clearly rejected in Lincoln Savings & Loan Ass\u2019n, 403 U.S. 345, 354\n(1971)(\u201cIt is not enough, in order that an expenditure qualify as an income tax\ndeduction, . . . that it serves to fortify . . . purpose and operation.\u201d)",

Indopco, 503 U.S. 79, 84 (1992). Nevertheless, Corporation X alleges that Commissioner v. Tellier, 383 U.S. 687 (1966),\nKornhauser v. Commissioner, 276 U.S. 145 (1928), Vanderbilt v. Commissioner, T.C.\nMemo 1957-235, and Helvering v. Hampton, 79 F.2d 358 (9th Cir. 1935) establish a\ncontrary rule for legal expenses. Corporation X errs. Tellier declined to disallow an otherwise allowable deduction on public policy grounds; it\nsays nothing about legal fees incurred to create assets and does not hold that legal fees\nshould be presumed to be deductible. Likewise, Kornhauser did not establish a\npresumption that all legal fees are deductible. Rather, the fees at issue in Kornhauser\n8 It is not known what amount, if any, Corporation X paid to acquire ownership of these ----- patents. POSTF-136693-12 30 were incurred in the defense of a suit for an accounting of businesses earnings, an\nordinary and necessary aspect of a business; not the creation or enhancement of a\nseparate asset. Thus, Kornhauser does not apply to Corporation X\u2019s facts, just as it did\nnot apply in Safety Tube Corp. v Commissioner, 168 F.2d 787, 790 (6th Cir.1948)\n(distinguished Kornhauser as a case not applicable when the litigation \u201cstruck at the\nvery ownership of the patent itself\u201d). In Vanderbilt, the taxpayer failed to carry its burden to prove part of the legal fees at\nissue were deductible. The court found that the remainder of the legal fees were not\nincurred in investigating a new business. Thus, the case did not hold that legal fees are\npresumed deductible. Hampton also says nothing about fees incurred to create an\nintangible or to create or enhance a separate and distinct asset. The case, like the\nothers, does not change the norm of capitalization just for legal fees. As stated in Lychuk v. Commissioner, 116 T.C. 374, 393-416 (2001),9 expenditures are\nnot ipso facto deductible because they are routine recurring expenses of a business. Lychuk applied Lincoln Savings & Loan Ass\u2019n, Indopco, Gilmore, Woodward and\nHelvering v. Winmill, 305 U.S. 79 (1938), and found \u201cpayments made with a sufficiently\ndirect connection to the acquisition, creation, or enhancement of a capital asset must be\ncapitalized even when those expenses are made in the course of the payee\u2019s regular\nbusiness operations.\u201d Lychuk, 116 T.C. at 409. All of the legal fees at issue herein\nhave a sufficiently direct connection with the creation of intangible assets and/or the\nprotection or perfection of title that they must be capitalized. IV.

Commissioner, 215 F.2d 17 (3rd Cir.\n1954), establishes that fees to defend patent infringement suits are per se deductible,\nCorporation X errs. Urquhart is a 1954 case that predates the more recent Supreme\nCourt cases that confirm the norm is still capitalization when considering whether\nexpenditures are deductible or capitalizable. See Indopco, 503 U.S. 79, 84 (1992)\n(addressing the strong foundation supporting the norm of capitalization), and the\nregulations under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4. Urquhart was decided a decade before\nUnited States v. Gilmore, 372 U.S. 39 (1963), the landmark Supreme Court case\naddressing the origin of the claim test.10 Also, Urquhart was decided decades before\n9 The change in litigation position announced in 2002 that cited Lychuk, Chief Counsel Notice CC-2002021, 2002 WL 32813480, addressed employee compensation, fixed overhead and de mimis transaction\ncosts, expenditures not addressed in this advice. 10 As of November 27, 2012, Westlaw listed ten positive cases relying on Urquhart, with all predating\nGilmore, except for three: Nickerson v. Kutschera, 390 F. 2d 812, 815, n.9 (3rd Cir. 1968), opinion after\nremand, 419 F. 2d 983 (3rd Cir. 1969) (a patent case stating \u201cwe do not reach the problem of whether\nlanguage in . . .; or Urquhart . . . , must be overruled . . . .\u201d); Technograph Printed Circuits, Ltd. v. U.S. 178\nCt. Cl. 543 (1967) (a patent case citing Urquhart relative to mutuality of estoppel); and Clark v POSTF-136693-12 31 the regulations required costs that facilitate the creation of intangibles to be capitalized. In addition, Urquhart did not address capitalization of legal fees incurred to create new\nassets, it addressed legal fees incurred to protect profits. Corporation X was not sued\nfor lost profits due to infringing sales of competing drugs; rather, Corporation X was\nsued because it sought FDA approval to market and sell competing drugs before the\nexpiration of the patents covering the branded drugs. None of the lawsuits even allege\nCorporation X commercialized its generic drugs; rather, all sought to delay FDA\napproval until all patents expired. The fact that Corporation X notified the soon-to-be\nplaintiffs that Corporation X was seeking FDA approval of ANDAs with paragraph IV\ncertifications, as required by law, does not preclude the lawsuits from being all about\nCorporation X obtaining new intangible capital assets to use in its trade or business. For the litigation arising from Corporation X\u2019s ANDA applications, the litigation facilitated\nthe transaction\u2014obtaining an ANDA. Finally, the taxpayer in Urquhart was in the business of patent licensing. The parties to\nANDA litigation are in the business of producing brand name and generic drugs. The\ntaxpayer\u2019s infringement litigation in Urquhart was of an ordinary and regular occurrence\nfocused on the royalties; in the cases at issue, the litigation is part of a larger process of\ncreating an intangible asset, the ANDA. Because of these distinctions, Urquhart is not dispositive of Corporation X\u2019s ANDA fees,\nand any arguments based upon the case do not advance the cause of the proponent. B. NDA Fees",

NDA Fees Likewise, Urquhart is not authority for a case where title is at issue because, in\nUrquhart, at the appellate level, it was \u201cconceded that no question of title was\ninvolved.\u201d 215 F.2d at 19 (emphasis added). Urquhart is the quintessential example of\na case that does not involve title since it was conceded that the case did not involve\ntitle. The joint venture that deducted the fees in Urquhart was merely protecting its\nroyalties from licensing two patents that it did not own. See Urquhart v. Commissioner,\n20 T.C. 944, 945 (1953), rev\u2019d, 215 F.2d 17 (3rd Cir. 1954) (\u201cAlthough title to these two\npatents was retained by Radcliffe M. Urquhart and George Gordon Urquhart, they\ninvested the joint venture with power to make arrangements for the administration and\nlicensing of these patents and to receive the royalties earned therefrom.\u201d). The joint\nventure\u2019s sole business income consisted of royalties generated by patents it did not Commissioner, 1989 WL 145988 (1989) aff\u2019d 455 N.W. 2d 480 (1990) (citing Urquhart for the proposition\ndeductibility does not depend on winning the lawsuit). Of the six cases listed in Westlaw as mentioning\nUrquhart, only one post-dated 1963, Rust-Oleum v. US, 280 F. Supp 796 (N.D. Ill, 1967), action on dec.,\n1968 WL 16312 (March 4, 1968) (protection of title predominated, disagreeing with the allocation, in part,\nto deductible expenditures). POSTF-136693-12 32 own. Id. (\u201cFrom 1942 through 1946 [the years at issue] the sole business conducted by\nthe joint venture was the licensing of the two patents.\u201d). In addition, because the Urquharts had sued a customer of the plaintiff, the plaintiff\u2019s\naction against Urquhart took the form of a declaratory judgment action, with the Third\nCircuit stating \u201c[t]he declaratory judgment remedy merely enabled a turn about of\nparties. Mere forms of action is immaterial.\u201d 215 F.2d at 20. The Urquhart court then\nfound the \u201cpurpose and intent are the same whether the Urquharts commenced the\naction, or maneuvered Pyrene into taking the initial litigative step.\u201d Id. Thus, arguably,\nUrquhart applied the primary purpose test, as one court has so found. Rust-Oleum v.\nUS, 280 F. Supp 796, 801 (N.D. Ill, 1967), action on dec., 1968 WL 16312 (March 4,\n1965)(protection of title predominated, disagreeing with the allocation, in part, to\ndeductible expenditures). The primary purpose test has been repudiated by the\nSupreme Court. See Woodward v. Commissioner, 397 U.S. 572, 578 (1970) (stating\nGilmore \u201crejected a test that looked to the consequences of the litigation, and did not\neven consider the taxpayer's motives or purposes in undertaking defense of the\nlitigation\u201d). See also American Stores v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 458, 470 (2000)\n(reiterates that the primary purpose test has been rejected); Anchor Coupling v. United\nStates, 427 F.2d 429, 434 (7th Cir. 1970) (rejected primary purpose test in favor of the\norigin of the claim test for settlements).",

Entity AI, unlike that in Urquhart, is not\nabout recovering lost profits, but about preventing commercialization of a generic drug\nand protecting Corporation X\u2019s title to its patent. The reliance on Urquhart in the\npreamble to the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (\u201cNPRM\u201d) merely reflects the fact that\ntitle was not at issue in Urquhart, and confirms that legal fees incurred to recover lost\nprofits are not capitalizable. 11 Accordingly, Urquhart does not establish precedent for\ncases where the litigation is, in whole or part, to protect or perfect title. V. Cost Recovery of ANDA Fees\nA. As Franchises, ANDAs are Amortizable \u00a7 197 Intangibles Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(g)(1) provides that \u201c[a]n amount required to be capitalized by\nthis section is not currently deductible under section 162. Instead, the amount generally\nis added to the basis of the intangible acquired or created. See section 1012.\u201d The\nquestion at hand is how the fees are added to the basis recovered. 11 See \u00a7 IV. H. (December 19, 2003) Guidance Regarding Deduction and Capitalization of Expenditures,\n67 Fed. Reg. 77701 (\u201cThe rule is not intended to require capitalization of amounts paid to protect the\nproperty against infringement and to recover profits and damages as a result of an infringement. As under\ncurrent law, these costs are generally deductible. See, e.g., Urquhart v. Commissioner, 215 F.2d 17 (3rd\nCir. 1954) (expenditures made by a licensor of patents to protect against infringement and to recover\nprofits and damages were made to protect, conserve, and maintain business profits, and not to defend or\nperfect title to property. Whether an amount is paid to defend or perfect title, on the one hand, or to\nprotect against infringement, on the other, is a factual matter.\u201d). POSTF-136693-12 33 1. ANDAs are Franchises The -4(d) regulations addressing created intangibles do not define the term \u201cfranchise\u201d. However, the term is defined within the capitalization of intangible regulations\naddressing acquired intangibles. \u201cFranchise\u201d for purpose of acquired intangibles has\nthe same meaning the term is given in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(10). See Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.263(a)-4(c)(1)(viii). Specifically, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(10) states that a\n\u201cfranchise has the meaning given in I.R.C. \u00a7 1253(b)(1) and \u201cincludes any agreement\nthat provides one of the parties to the agreement with the right to distribute, sell, or\nprovide goods, services, or facilities, within a specified area.\u201d Section 1253(b)(1)\ndefines a franchise to \u201cinclude an agreement which gives one of the parties to the\nagreement the right to distribute, sell, or provide goods, services, or facilities, within a\nspecified area.\" Corporation X\u2019s ANDAs fit neatly into the \u00a7 1253(b)(1) definition of a franchise since the\nANDAs give Corporation X the right to market and sell its ANDA products within the\nUnited States, a territory that encompasses the entire country.",

Courts have noted that\nCongress provided an \"expansive definition\" of franchise to \u201cinclude\u201d agreements to sell\nor distribute goods within a specified area, which does not exclude other things\notherwise within the meaning of a franchise. See, e.g., Jefferson-Pilot Corp. v.\nCommissioner, 98 T.C. 435, 441 (1992), aff'd 995 F.2d 530 (4th Cir. 1993) (FCC\nlicenses are agreements \u201cbetween the Federal Government and the licensee, under\nwhich the licensee agrees to provide the service of radio broadcasting within a specified\narea in exchange for the right to broadcast\u201d). Id. at 443. See also, Jefferson-Pilot Corp.\nv. Commissioner, 995 F. 2d 530 at 531 (4th Cir. 1993) (\u201cThe definition of term\n\u2018franchise\u2019 is sufficiently broad to include licenses issued by the FCC.\u201d). That the right to market and sell came from the FDA, not the Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC), is a distinction without a difference \u2013 both the FDA and FCC are\ngranting, for a territory, commercialization rights. See also Addendum A, \u00a7 3\n(enumerating the quality controls and other restrictions imposed on the ANDA holder to\nretain the rights to market and sell, with the controls similar in nature to the \u201cstrings\u201d a\nfranchiser would retain over its franchise, e.g., quality controls). In addition, the\nidentified categories of expenditures that must be capitalized are construed broadly, and\nnot limited by narrow technical arguments. T.D. 9107, 2004-1 C.B. 447, \u00a7 II. D.\nAccordingly, FDA-approved ANDAs that allow the marketing and selling of new drugs in\nthe United States are franchises within the meaning of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(5)(i). 2. As Franchises, ANDAs are Section 197 Intangibles The second inquiry is whether ANDAs are amortizable section 197 intangibles. Specifically, the regulations provide as follows: POSTF-136693-12 34 Section 197 allows an amortization deduction for the capitalized\ncosts of an amortizable section 197 intangible and prohibits any\nother depreciation or amortization with respect to that property. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(a)(emphasis added). As opined above, an ANDA granted by the FDA is a franchise for purposes of the\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d) regulations. For the same reasons, an ANDA is also a\nsection 197 intangible. An approved ANDA provides the applicant (or current holder) a\nright granted by the FDA to sell specific generic pharmaceutical products in the territory\nof the United States, subject to complying with the reporting requirements of the FDA,\nwhich are in the nature of quality controls a franchisor would typically have over a\nfranchise. See Addendum A, \u00a7 3 (reporting, investigatory and production requirements\nimposed on an ANDA holder). Thus ANDAs satisfy the I.R.C. \u00a7 1253(b)(1) definition\nbecause ANDAs are agreements which provide a taxpayer with the right to distribute\nand sell a specific product (generic pharmaceuticals) within a specific area (the United\nStates). Because the FDA is a governmental unit that approves the right to sell, market,\nand distribute drugs subject to ANDAs, an approved ANDA also meets the definition of\na franchise under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(10).",

As Franchises, ANDAs are\nAmortizable Section 197 Intangibles I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(1) defines \u201c[a]mortizable section 197 intangible,\u201d stating:\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the term \u201camortizable\nsection 197 intangible\u201d means any section 197 intangible\u2014\n(A) which is acquired by the taxpayer after the date of the\nenactment of this section [August 10, 1993], and (B) which is held in connection with the conduct of a trade\nor business or an activity described in section 212. In Broz II v. Commissioner, 137 T.C. 46 (2011),12 the Tax Court addressed the\ninterpretation of the \u201cin connection with a trade or business\u201d requirement set forth in\nI.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(1)(B). In that case, the taxpayer contended that an FCC license could\nbe amortized upon acquisition, regardless of whether the entity holding the FCC\nlicenses had commenced a trade or business. The Commissioner contended the FCC\nlicense could not be amortized until commencement of a trade or business to which the\nlicense related. The Tax Court found for the Commissioner, interpreting the phrase \u201cin\nconnection with the conduct of a trade or business\u201d in \u00a7 197(c)(1)(B) as follows:\n12 Broz I v. Commissioner, 137 T.C. 46 (2011), decided other issues of first impression. POSTF-136693-12 35 The inclusion of the word \u201cconduct\u201d indicates to us that the intangibles\nmust be used in connection with a business that is being conducted. We find, therefore, that section 197 contains an active trade or\nbusiness requirement similar to the requirement imposed by section\n162. Broz II v. Commissioner, 137 T.C. at 69 (footnote omitted). The Broz II Court then found that, because the entity holding the FCC license was not\nengaged in an active trade or business, the entity was not entitled to any amortization\ndeductions for the FCC license. The facts of this case clearly establish that Corporation X was engaged in the trade or\nbusiness of developing, producing, marketing and selling generic and brand name\ndrugs prior to incurring the attorney fees at issue in order to market and sell generic and\nbrand name drugs. Therefore, unless otherwise excluded from being an amortizable\nsection 197 intangible, ANDAs that were approved by the FDA after August 10, 1993,\nsuch as those for which the professional fees in dispute were incurred, will qualify as\namortizable section 197 intangibles of the trade or business to which the ANDAs relate. I.R.C. \u00a7 197 excludes certain self-created intangibles from the category of amortizable\n\u00a7197 intangibles, stating:\n[T]he term \u201camortizable section 197 intangible\u201d shall not include any\nsection 197 intangible\u2014\n(A)\n(B) which is not described in subparagraph (D), (E), or\n(F) of subsection (d)(1), and\nwhich is created by the taxpayer.

Pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(2), amortizable \u00a7 197 intangibles do include self-created\nintangibles described in \u00a7 197(d)(1)(D) (relating to licenses, permits or other rights\ngranted by a government unit), \u00a7 197(d)(1)(E) (relating to covenant not to complete) or\n\u00a7 197(d)(1)(F) (relating to franchises, trademarks, and trade names). For example,\ncosts incurred relative to a franchise or a government-granted right are not excepted\nfrom the amortizable \u00a7 197 category because franchises are excepted from the selfcreated exception by \u00a7 197(d)(1)(F) and government-granted rights are excepted from\nthe self-created exception by \u00a7 197(d)(1)(E). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that,\nalthough I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(2) does not apply if the intangible is created in connection with\na transaction (or a series of transactions) involving the acquisition of assets constituting\na trade or business or substantial portion thereof, there was no purchase of a trade or\nbusiness by Corporation X in this case. However, because Corporation X created, POSTF-136693-12 36 rather than acquired, its franchises, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(e)(2) does not impact the\ntreatment of Corporation X\u2019s ANDAs as amortizable section 197 intangibles. 13\nTreas.

Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(d)(2)(iii) confirms franchises are not excluded from amortizable\nsection 197 intangibles, citing I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(F). As discussed above, an approved ANDA is a government granted franchise within both\nI.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(F) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(b)(10). The self-created exception only\napplies to any section 197 intangible NOT described in I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(D), (E), and\n(F). Therefore, the exception provided in I.R.C. \u00a7 197(c)(2) is inapplicable to FDAapproved ANDAs. Accordingly, FDA-approved ANDAs are amortizable section 197\nintangibles. 4.

Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(f)(1) (emphasis added) An FDA-approved ANDA is acquired for purposes of I.R.C. \u00a7 197 on the effective date\nof the final FDA approval, provided all applicable exclusionary periods have expired. e.g., the effective date is not subject to a condition precedent such as the expiration of\nthe period of exclusivity barring the ANDA holder from immediately commencing\nmarketing and selling of the drugs the subject of the ANDA in the United States. 14\nANDAs are treated as acquired on said date because that is the date the holder of an\nANDA can begin to market and sell the generic drugs that are the subject of the ANDA\nin the United States. Applying the rule set forth in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(f)(1) to the matter at hand,\nCorporation X\u2019s 15-year amortization period for recovering the attorney fees associated\nwith its approved ANDAs would begin the first day of the month in which the FDA finally\napproves the ANDAs as effective with no exclusionary periods barring the immediate\nmarketing and selling of drugs the subject of the ANDAs, since that is the later date of\nwhen Corporation X enters into a trade or business or when the amortizable \u00a7 197\nintangibles are acquired.

VI. Cost Recovery of the Fees to Protect or Perfect Patents\nA. Fees Incurred to Protect or Perfect Patents Are\nRecovered Under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.167(a)-14\n1. Patents At Issue Are Not Section 197 Intangibles According to I.R.C. \u00a7 197(d)(1)(C)(iii), a section 197 intangible includes any patent,\ncopyright, formula, process, design, pattern, knowhow, format, or other similar item. I.R.C. \u00a7 197(e)(4)(C) provides an exception to the general rule of I.R.C.\n\u00a7 197(d)(1)(C)(iii), stating that if an interest in a patent or copyright is not acquired in a\ntransaction (or a series of related transactions) involving the acquisition of assets\nconstituting a trade or business or substantial portion thereof, then the patent or\ncopyright shall not be included in the definition \u201csection 197 intangible.\u201d See also Treas.\nReg. \u00a7 1.197-2(c)(7). Since there is no indication that the patents listed in the Orange Book for Drug #8 were\nacquired by Corporation X as part of the acquisition of assets constituting a trade or\nbusiness, or substantial part thereof, the patents do not qualify as section 197\nintangibles. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(c)(7) indicates that the applicable rules for interests\nin patents not acquired as part of a trade or business are set forth in Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.167(a)-14(c)(4) (governing depreciation deductions for interests in patents (other\nthan such interests acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business) described in\nI.R.C. \u00a7 167(f)(2) and Treas.

POSTF-136693-12 39 If an intangible asset is not included among the intangibles subject to I.R.C. \u00a7 197, the\nintangible asset may be subject to depreciation in accordance with I.R.C. \u00a7 167.

Reg. \u00a7 1.167(a)-14(c)(4), the basis of a\npatent may be depreciated using one of the following methods, as appropriate:\n(1) Ratably over the remaining useful life of the patent;\n(2) Under the income forecast method provided by I.R.C. \u00a7 167(g); or\n(3) If the purchase price of a patent is payable at least annually as a fixed\namount per use or a fixed percentage of revenue generated from use of the\npatent, the amount paid or incurred during the taxable year can be treated as\nthe depreciation deduction for such taxable year. Consequently, Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.167(a)-14(c)(4) governs the depreciation of the patents\nfor Drug #8 commencing with the dates when they were placed in service. Here,\nCorporation X is not making payments to purchase the patents in question and there is\nno indication that it has applied the income forecast method. Accordingly, the bases of\nthe patents are depreciable ratably over their useful lives. 3. Fees Incurred to Protect and Perfect Patents Would Be\nRecovered over the Remaining Lives of the Patents, After\nthe Fees Are Divided Pro Rata Among the Patents Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.167(a)-14(c)(5) provides that rules similar to those in Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7 1.197-2(f)(2) apply for purposes of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.167(a)-14(c). Treas.

Reg. \u00a7 1.197-2(f)(1) and before the expiration of that period is amortized\nratably over the remainder of the 15-year period. Thus, the legal fees incurred by\nCorporation X associated with protecting its patent for Drug #8 are depreciable ratably\nover the remaining useful lives of the patents listed in the Orange Book for Drug #8,\nafter dividing such fees pro rata among the patents and so increasing the bases of such\npatents.

One example in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263A1(e)(3)(ii)(I) is cost recovery, including depreciation, amortization, and cost recovery\nallowances on equipment and facilities (including depreciation or amortization of selfconstructed assets or other previously produced or acquired property to which I.R.C.\n\u00a7 263A or I.R.C. \u00a7 263 applies). Another example in particular, found at Treas.

Obtaining FDA approval of the generic drugs and complying with FDA manufacturing\nguidelines are incident and necessary for Corporation X\u2019s drug manufacturing\noperations. Further, Corporation X\u2019s drugs would not be produced if they could not be\nmarketed and sold. Thus, the ANDAs directly benefit, and/or were obtained to enable,\nthe production of the generic drugs and the annual cost recovery (amortization or\ndepreciation) is an indirect cost that is properly allocable to the generic drugs that\nCorporation X produces and must be capitalized. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.263A1(e)(3)(i). Accordingly, Corporation X\u2019s annual cost recovery for ANDAs, which are\notherwise deductible, must be capitalized pursuant to the uniform capitalization rules of\nI.R.C. \u00a7 263A. VIII. The Commissioner May Change Corporation X\u2019s Method of Accounting\nOn an ANDA-by-ANDA and Patent-by-Patent Basis\nA. A change in Corporation X\u2019s treatment of attorney fees for an\nANDA or for protecting and perfecting patents is a\nchange in method of accounting under \u00a7\u00a7 446 and 481 POSTF-136693-12 41 A change in method of accounting includes a change in the treatment of any material\nitem used in an overall method of accounting. A \u201cmaterial item\u201d includes \u201cany item that\ninvolves the proper time for the inclusion of the item in income or the taking of a\ndeduction.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.446-1(e)(2)(ii)(a). In determining whether timing is\ninvolved, generally the pertinent inquiry is whether the accounting practice permanently\naffects the taxpayer's lifetime income or merely changes the taxable year in which\ntaxable income is reported. 15 An accounting practice that involves the timing of when an item is included in income or\nwhen it is deducted is considered a method of accounting. General Motors Corp. v.\nCommissioner, 112 T.C. 270, 296 (1999); Color Arts, Inc. v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo.\n2003-95. Under the foregoing principles, a change from deducting an expense when paid or\nincurred to capitalizing such expense, or vice versa, generally constitutes a change in\nmethod of accounting. Expensing and capitalization generally result in the same\ncumulative taxable income over the lifetime of the taxpayer. For example, an\nexpenditure of $1,000 that is deducted in full when it is paid or incurred reduces a\ntaxpayer\u2019s lifetime taxable income by $1,000. If the same expenditure is capitalized,\ntaxpayer\u2019s lifetime taxable income will also be reduced by $1,000 through deductions for\ndepreciation or amortization, recognition of basis resulting in a reduction of gain (or an\nincrease of loss) on sale or disposition of the asset, or a combination of the foregoing.",

POSTF-136693-12 42 The treatment of Corporation X\u2019s attorney fees for each ANDA or patent as either\ndeductible or capitalizable is a \u201cmaterial item\u201d used in Corporation X\u2019s overall plan of\naccounting because such treatment involves the proper time for the taking of deductions\nfor such attorney fees. Further, such treatment does not permanently affect Corporation\nX\u2019s lifetime income. Accordingly, the change in the treatment of Corporation X\u2019s\nattorney fees for each ANDA or patent from immediately deductible (when incurred) to\ncapitalizable (when incurred) is a change in a material item used in Corporation X\u2019s\noverall plan of accounting for gross income and deductions.

New Drug Applications The 2007 Coordinated Issue Paper on taxation of drug development agreements\nsummarizes the process for developing a new (non-generic) drug for FDA approval. The pharmaceutical/biotech drug development process is generally\ncomposed of four stages: Preclinical or discovery research, clinical\ndevelopment, regulatory approval, and post marketing. These stages take\napproximately 10 to 12 years to complete. In the preclinical or discovery research stage (typically the first two years\nof the discovery/development process), a compound is tested on animals\nand non-human systems. If the compound/molecule looks promising at\nthis stage, it is patented. The patent prevents other companies from freely\nusing the same compound/molecule for 20 years (life span of a patent). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established a set of standards\n(called \"Good Laboratory Practice\") for this stage of development to\nensure quality of animal testing and the resultant data for an\nInvestigational New Drug Application (IND). If the IND is approved by the\nFDA, testing of the compound/molecule in humans can begin. Th[e] second stage is known as clinical development. Clinical\ndevelopment (typically spans 5 to 7 years or years 3 through 10 of the\ndiscovery/development process) is normally conducted in three phases. In Phase I, the first trials in humans are conducted for safety, tolerance\nand pharmacokinetics. In Phase II, testing is done to evaluate\neffectiveness, dosage and safety in selected populations of patients with\nthe disease or condition to be treated, diagnosed or prevented. In Phase\nIII, expanded clinical trials are conducted to gather additional evidence to\nverify dosage and effectiveness for specific indications and to better\nunderstand safety and adverse effects. These are large-scale trials POSTF-136693-12 49 typically involving thousands of patients to prove effectiveness against a\nspecific disease or condition. The third stage, known as the regulatory approval stage, begins after\nPhase III trials have been completed (typically spans 12 to 18 months or\nyears 11 and 12 of the discovery/development process). Sponsors file a\nNew Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA to obtain authorization to\nmarket a new pharmaceutical product. The NDA consists of clinical and\nnonclinical data on the product's safety and effectiveness and a full\ndescription of the methods, facilities, and quality controls employed in\nmanufacturing and packaging. Until the FDA grants authorization, a drug\nsponsor cannot market the drug in the United States. The final stage, post-marketing studies (also called Phase IV), occurs after\nthe product has received FDA approval.",

POSTF-136693-12 52 also contain distinct, definite claims that set out the proprietary\ninterest asserted by the inventor. Trained personnel at the USPTO, known as examiners, review all\napplications to ensure that the invention described and claimed in the\napplication fulfills the pertinent requirements of the patent law. If the\nUSPTO believes that the application fulfills the statutory requirements, it\nwill allow the application to issue as a granted patent. Each patent\nordinarily enjoys a term of twenty years commencing from the date the\npatent application was filed. If the patent proprietor was unable to market\nits product for a period of the patent term due to lack of approval by the\nFDA, the term may be extended by a portion of the regulatory review\nperiod in some circumstances. Granted patents give the patentee the right to exclude others from making,\nusing, selling, offering to sell, or importing into the United States the\npatented invention. Parties who engage in those acts without the\npermission of the patent proprietor during the term of the patent can be\nheld liable for infringement. The patentee may file a civil suit in federal\ncourt in order to enjoin infringers and obtain monetary remedies. Although\nissued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, accused infringers may\nassert that the patent is invalid or unenforceable on a number of grounds. Wendy H. Schacht and John R.

While not providing the necessary FDA approval to market and sell, patents protection\nis critical to pharmaceutical companies that develop, market and sell pioneer drugs in\nthe United States. The critical roll of patents is summarized in one paragraph by the\nCongressional Research Service Report. The significant costs of pharmaceutical R&D, coupled with the\nuncertainty of the clinical trial process, lend consequence to patents in\n[the pioneer pharmaceutical] area because \u201cthe disparity between\nthe investment of innovators and those of imitators is particularly\nlarge in pharmaceuticals \u2013 almost as large as when software pirates\nsimply copy the diskettes of an innovator.\u201d While the capitalized cost of\ndeveloping a new drug to the point of market approval is estimated at over\n$800 million, it takes only between $1 million and $2 million to obtain\napproval for a generic version of the chemically synthesized\npharmaceutical.

When an FDA-approved NDA loses patent exclusivity and generic versions are\ncommercialized, there can be a significant loss in sales.

The Hatch-Waxman Act sought to correct two distortions in the law, as explained in Eli\nLilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U.S. 661 (1990). First, the holder of a patent relating to such products [drugs subject to\nFDA approval] would as a practical matter not be able to reap any\nfinancial rewards during the early years of the [patent] term. When an\ninventor makes a potentially useful discovery, he ordinarily protects it by\napplying for a patent at once. Thus, if the discovery relates to a product\nthat cannot be marketed without substantial testing and regulatory\napproval, the \u201cclock\u201d on his patent term will be running even though he is\nnot yet able to derive any profit from the invention. The second distortion occurred at the other end of the patent term. In\n1984, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided that the\nmanufacture, use, or sale of a patented invention during the term of the\npatent constituted an act of infringement, see 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a), even if it\nwas for the sole purpose of conducting tests and developing information\nnecessary to apply for regulatory approval. Since that activity could not be\ncommenced by those who planned to compete with the patentee until\nexpiration of the entire patent term, the patentee's de facto monopoly\nwould continue for an often substantial period until regulatory approval\nwas obtained. In other words, the combined effect of the patent law and\nthe premarket regulatory approval requirement was to create an effective\nextension of the patent term. The 1984 Act sought to eliminate this distortion from both ends of\nthe patent period. Section 201 of the Act established a patent-term\nextension for patents relating to certain products that were subject to\nlengthy regulatory delays and could not be marketed prior to regulatory\napproval. . . . 29 More specifically, \u201c[t]o obtain FDA approval, a generic manufacturer must ordinarily show, among other\nthings, that its product has the same active ingredients as an approved brand-name drug; that \u2018the route\nof administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the new drug are the same\u2019 as the brand-name\ndrug; and that its product is \u2018bioequivalent\u2019 to the brand-name drug.

By eliminating the need for generic manufacturers to prove their drugs\u2019 safety and efficacy\nindependently, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments allow generic manufacturers to bring drugs to market\nmuch less expensively.\u201d Pliva v.

The distortion at the other end of the patent period was addressed by\n\u00a7 202 of the Act. That added to the provision prohibiting patent\ninfringement, . . . [a section] establishing that \u201cit shall not be an act of\ninfringement to make, use, or sell a patented invention . . . solely for uses\nreasonably related to the development and submission of information\nunder a Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of\ndrugs.\u201d This allows competitors, prior to the expiration of a patent, to\nengage in otherwise infringing activities necessary to obtain regulatory\napproval. 496 U.S. at 669-71 (emphasis added, citations and footnotes omitted). Thus, while prior to the Hatch-Waxman Act non-authorized generic equivalents of\npatented drugs could not be developed without infringing the patents that covered the\ndrug,30 under the 1984 revisions the unauthorized use of a patented drug for the\npurposes of developing a generic drug no longer constitutes an act of\ninfringement.31 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2010). However, the \u201csafe harbor\u201d from infringement terminates when the ANDA is filed\nwith the FDA. The termination of the \u201csafe harbor\u201d occurs, as applicable, because the\nHatch-Waxman Act makes filing of an ANDA prior to the expiration of the patents\ncovering the approved NDA an act of infringement in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(2010),\nwhich has limited remedies (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(4)).

To counter the burden of being sued for infringement, the Hatch-Waxman Act\nprovides an incentive for the generic company to expose itself to an infringement suit\nin order to bring a generic drug to market: a 180-day period of exclusivity for the\ngeneric product in the market. The fundamental goal behind 180-day exclusivity was to provide an\nincentive for generic drug applicants to challenge innovator patents, and\nthe core of the concept--as it has been applied by the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) and the courts--is that the first generic drug applicant\nto challenge an innovator's patent is entitled to six months of exclusivity\nagainst subsequent patent challengers for the same innovator drug. 180day exclusivity is governed by sections 505(j)(5)(B)(iv) and 505(j)(5)(D) of\nthe FDCA.

The FDA\u2019s\ninterpretation of the definition of tentative approval letters may limit the use of tentative approval letters to\nsituations where the exclusivity period is relative to the NDA-approved drugs (e.g., new innovative drug\nfor certain rare diseases exclusivity) - periods of exclusivity that can apply after the patents expire and are\ncross-referenced in the statute provision defining tentative approval, not the 180-day exclusivity of the first\napplicant.

Korn, Erika Lietzan\nand Shaw W. Scott (cited above) addresses multiple views of the value of the 180-day\nexclusivity,40 with one view stated as follows (emphasis added):41\nIn light of the average selling price of the first generic drug in the market,\nsome have estimated that a first filer awarded 180-day exclusivity\ncould, in fact, \u201cexpect a 1,000 percent return on investment.\u201d In\naddition, first filers, by launching their generic drugs in the absence of\nother generic competitors, may have the advantage of being able to enter\ninto long-term supply contracts with pharmacies retailing their products. Tentative Approval. If a generic drug product is ready for approval before the expiration\nof any patents or exclusivities accorded to the reference listed drug product, FDA issues\na tentative approval letter to the applicant. The tentative approval letter details the\ncircumstances associated with the tentative approval. FDA delays final approval of the\ngeneric drug product until all patent or exclusivity issues have been resolved. A tentative\napproval does not allow the applicant to market the generic drug product.

About one-quarter (20 out of 76) of those\npatent settlements involved (1) an explicit agreement by the brand not to launch an AG to compete\nagainst the first filer, combined with (2) an agreement by the first-filer generic to defer its entry past the\nsettlement date by, on average, 34.7 months. With regard to these twenty settlements, branded sales of\nthe affected products ranged from $12.6 million to $5.3 billion, with an average market size of $917\nmillion and a median market size of $514 million.
