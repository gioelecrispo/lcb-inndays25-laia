FACTS This opinion is based on facts determined for the taxpayer\u2019s taxable years ending\nJanuary 31, Year 10 and January 31, Year 11. A is a State of G, Non-stock Corporation. A was formed in Year 0 as an unincorporated association by B (now a subsidiary of C)\nfor the purpose of organizing a services program. A incorporated formally on Year 0+6. A uses the cash basis method of accounting for book purposes and the accrual method\nfor tax purposes. A does not include gift check sales proceeds as income for book or\ntax purposes. Although A uses the term ------------------ to describe itself, and this\nopinion uses the name ---------- for the taxpayer, A is a C corporation and is NOT ------------------------------------------ for federal income tax purposes. A\u2019s members include B and its U.S. franchisees (there are hundreds of U.S.\nfranchisees).

A sells gift checks, in preset denominations of $X or $XX, in different ways. First,\nA provides checks to D stores for sale to customers, and D stores pay A the face value\nof the gift checks. Second, A sells gift checks directly to scrip organizations at a 10%\ndiscount, which in turn, resell the gift checks. A recognizes the discount at the time of\nsale for both book and tax purposes. Finally, A sells gift checks through online sales. The link to online sales is located on the B website; however, A processes the orders\nand directly receives payment. The link on the B website is strictly a service provided\nfor the benefit of --------. A maintains a small supply of gift checks on hand to fill orders\nfrom D stores, scrip organizations and online sales.

The gift checks are similar to actual checks that circulate in the economy as\nnegotiable instruments. The pre-numbered gift checks have separate checking account\nnumbers based upon the face value of the gift check and, like an actual check, are\nprocessed through the Federal Reserve System. The gift checks are honored by E\nwhen presented for payment. The gift checks are not dated and have no expiration\ndates. A orders the gift checks in batches, and A opens a new checking account each\ntime a batch of gift checks is produced. On average it takes about three (3) years to sell\nan entire batch of gift checks. Because the gift checks are associated with a specific bank account through\nwhich they clear, A establishes a general ledger account for each batch of gift checks\nby denomination.",

A will not deliver gift checks until it receives payment\n(for the face amount of the gift checks for gift checks provided to D stores). A initially\ndeposits amounts that it receives into its general checking account. The entry to record\nthe sale is a debit to the general checking account (Checking account #1####) and a\ncredit to the corresponding gift check liability account that has been set up for the\nspecific batch by denomination (i.e., general ledger account 2#### Redeemable $XX\nLetter, Letter (Letter) Redeemable $XX GC (T)). At the end of each month, A transfers the amounts from the general checking\naccount to a specific checking account. The entry to record this transfer is a credit to\nthe general cash account Checking account #1#### and a debit to the specific cash\naccount. When a gift check is redeemed by a customer for goods at a redeeming D\nstore, the specific cash account is credited and a contra liability account, which was also\nset up on the books for each batch by denomination, is debited. The redeeming D store\nnegotiates the gift check and receives payment from the checking account established\nfor redemptions. Disbursements from the checking account established for each batch of gift\nchecks are solely for redemptions. Therefore, the balance in any gift check cash\naccount represents the unredeemed gift checks by batch by denomination. Also, the\nnet amount of the gift check liability account and the contra liability account equals the\n3 Examination\u2019s Workpapers include information setting forth general ledger trial balance for checking\naccounts by batch.

At the point redemptions slow to about $10 a\nmonth, A recommends to the board to close the checking account and transfer the\nfunds back into the general checking account to be used for services. If approved, A\ncloses the checking account and transfers the funds to the general checking account. A\nusually closes a checking account eight (8) to ten (10) years from the date it sells the\nlast check from a batch. D stores are not required to participate in gift check sales.

DISCUSSION, LAW AND ANALYSIS\nIssue 1: Are the proceeds that A receives from the sale of gift checks gross\nincome or nontaxable member contributions, deposits or funds held-in-trust? A. The non-taxable A members\u2019 contributions are separate and apart from\nA\u2019s taxable gift check sales proceeds. There is no logical or documented relationship between members\u2019 contributions\nand gift check sale proceeds. A\u2019s members make monthly contributions based on a\ncontribution rate that is in effect at the time the payment is due. The rate may be X+1%\nor X% of \"sales\" per month. A reports amounts contributed by members ----------------\u201cOther Income---------------------of its Forms 1120. This line, reportedly, does not include Credit\n50,000 POSTF-149051-10 10 any of the gift check sale proceeds. For example, for the year ended January 31, Year\n10, A reported members\u2019 contributions of $1##,###,###.00; and, for the year ended\nJanuary 31, Year 11, A reported members\u2019 contributions of $1##,###,###.00. A represents that it was formed solely for the not-for-profit purpose of conducting\nor promoting services that the D stores could not afford. The \u201cServices Agreement\u201d\nbetween A and the D stores specifies under Section 3 \u2013 Expenditures by -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: [A] agrees that it will operate solely for the not-for-profit purposes of\nconducting \u2026 [services]\u2026 related to B and related products and that all\namounts contributed to it by Franchisee will be expended solely for such\npurposes in connection with \u2026, \u201cB and D products\u201d and related products\napproved for sale at D outlets by Franchisor by the [various means of\nproviding the services and an enumeration of services]. All contributions\nreceived by \u2026[A]\u2026 shall be received in trust and disbursed solely for the\nnot-for-profit purposes set forth in its Certificates of Incorporation. No part\nof any contribution shall be returned to Franchisee. Paragraph 2.4(b) of A\u2019s restated bylaws, dated Month ##, Year, states: All contributions of members and other income shall be received by ,,, A in\ntrust and shall be disbursed and expended solely for the not-for-profit\npurposes set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of \u2026 A and no part\nthereof, either before or after the termination or dissolution of \u2026[A], shall\ninure to the benefit of any private member or individual. The gift check sale proceeds do not meet the definition of contributions\nestablished by A\u2019s own documents. For example, A\u2019s by-laws and the Month #, Year\nboard minutes make a distinction between the members\u2019 contributions and other\nincome, which would include \u201cthe income (if any) derived from unredeemed Gift\nCertificates.\u201d",

POSTF-149051-10 11 Based on A\u2019s response to IDR##, these minutes were never reduced to a written\nagreement between A and its members. Although the stated purpose of A is a non-profit [special entity] for the members,\nA is still a corporation subject to the general rules of corporate income taxation. -----------------------------are not exempt from federal income taxation, and, in general, are taxed in\nthe same manner as other corporations.

The only --------------- income that escapes taxation\nat the ---------------- level is patronage source income that flows through to the patrons. To date, A reportedly has not distributed any -------------- dividends to any\nmember, despite having operated as a [special entity] for many years. A has not\nrepresented that the gift check sales are ------------------------- income. But, assuming\narguendo, that they were, A has not flowed through this income to patrons under\nSubchapter T or any other provision. Further, A did not flow through gift check sales\nincome to A\u2019s members within the prescribed time limit under Subchapter T. See I.R.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1381-1388 requirements to transfer the incidence of taxation to a ----------------\u2019s\npatrons. The fact that A uses the gift check sale proceeds that exceed gift check\nredemptions for\u2026 purposes \u2026 [that benefit its members]\u2026 does not transform the\nsales proceeds to members\u2019 contributions. The members did not sell the gift checks, did\nnot include the proceeds in gross income, and did not contribute the gift check proceeds\nto A for \u2026 [service]\u2026 purposes.

B. The proceeds that A receives from its direct sale of gift checks to the\npublic or third parties are not deposits or funds held in trust.

Burnet, 286 U.S. 417 (1932), reflects the\ngeneral rule that amounts received under a claim of right and without restriction as to its\ndisposition constitute income in the year of receipt, even though the taxpayer might be\nrequired ultimately to restore an equivalent amount. In Johnson v. Commissioner, 108\nT.C. 448, 470 (1997), aff\u2019d 184 F.3d 786 (8th Cir. 1999), the court explained that not all\nrefundable payments can be excluded from income and that a characteristic of a\ndeposit is the lack of a binding agreement to apply the sum to the purchase of specific\ngoods and services. C. A\u2019s position\nA\u2019s position is that all amounts that it receives from gift check transactions are\nheld in trust for the benefit of its members and do not constitute gross income. A asserts\nthat it acts as an intermediary that only handles the administration of the gift checks;\ntherefore, no amount is taxable income. In addition, A asserts that these funds are\nburdened with the obligation of use for [services] purposes. As stated in its returns, A\nconsiders the amounts it receives from its members to be:\n[B]urdened with the obligation to expend such sums for \u2026[services]\u2026\npurposes. Such payments, therefore, do not constitute gross income and\nthe A is not subject to tax upon the excess of its receipts over its\ndisbursements. Likewise, disbursements over receipts do not constitute a\nloss. Thus, A asserts that it is not required to include proceeds from gift check transactions in\nincome for both tax and book purposes.",

Ascertaining that the taxpayer does not do\nboth (fail to recognize gift check income yet take a services expense deduction for gift check proceeds\nspent in services) may also be relevant to whether the taxpayer\u2019s treatment of gift check proceeds\nreflects a method of accounting. The fact that the taxpayer\u2019s exclusion of gift check proceeds from income\nis a permanent exclusion suggests that this is not a method of accounting. However, an argument can be\nmade to the contrary. Therefore, if during your examination of the gift check issue in future cycles, you\ndeem it appropriate or necessary to make adjustments for closed years, it will be necessary to address\nthis complex issue. If this is the case, you will need to request further advice to addresses the question of\nwhether the taxpayer\u2019s exclusion of gift check proceeds from income is a method of accounting. Any POSTF-149051-10 13 Because its bylaws require that all \u201cother income shall be received by A in trust\nand shall be disbursed and expended solely for the non-for-profit purposes,\u201d i.e., for\nservices program purposes, A argues that gift check proceeds cannot be taxed because\nthey are required to be used for services. However, A does not distinguish between\namounts received from gift checks that are never redeemed, which may be used for\nservices, and amounts that are paid to the redeeming D stores, which are obviously not\nused for services. 6 Citing the --------------------Program and Section 3 of the [Services] Agreement\nbetween A and D stores, A maintains that an amount received by a taxpayer is not an\naccession to wealth that must be included in gross income if the taxpayer never\nexercises dominion or control over the amount. A argues that gross income does not\ninclude amounts that a taxpayer receives acting in a fiduciary capacity or as a conduit\nfor payment to another. A asserts that it does not handle the gift check program for its\nown benefit. Given A\u2019s position that it acts as an intermediary that only handles the\nadministration of the gift checks, any activity related to the gift checks is recorded\ndirectly on the balance sheet [Cash (segregated on the trial balance by allotment) and\nUnredeemed Gift Certificates accounts]. However, A\u2019s direct sales of gift checks to online purchasers and scrip\norganizations are sales, and not deposits, in which the purchaser receives the right to\nreceive goods and services.",

Further, for the direct sales, D stores do not advance any\nfunds to the taxpayer, and A is not holding any of the proceeds from these sales as\ndeposits or funds held-in-trust for the benefit of the D stores. On the other hand, when A places gift checks with D stores to be sold by D\nstores to customers, the D store retains the ability to redeem the checks and recover\nthe funds. These funds held by A may be viewed as deposit or an amount held in trust\nfor the benefit of D stores. However, once a D store sells the gift check to a customer\nor other third-party,7 the store has no right to recover the funds. Thus, if the value of the\ngift check funds held by A is viewed as a D store deposit, the funds are no longer a\ndeposit when the D store sells the gift check to a customer. Taxpayer\u2019s reliance on the Seven-Up, supra, case is misplaced. such request with regard to taxpayer\u2019s method of accounting will require referral to the national office,\nCC:ITA:7.\n6 We conclude that the redemption amounts represent cost of sales (for A\u2019s previous gift check sales) that\nA may deduct when paid to the redeeming store, and the amounts received by the redeeming stores\nrepresent food sale revenue to the food establishment. 7 It is important to note that the D stores may be reimbursed not only by selling the gift check, but also by\nusing the gift checks as a means to pay employees, or for sale incentives, or otherwise. In all of these\ncases, the exchange is presumed to be an arms-length exchange for equal value. POSTF-149051-10 14 Taxpayer relies solely on Seven-Up Co. v. Commissioner, 14 T.C. 965 (1950)\nacq. 1950-2 C.B. 4, withdrawn and acq 1974-2 C.B. 4, to support its position that gift\ncheck sales proceeds are not taxable income. In that case, the Tax Court determined\nthat funds deposited with a soft drink company by its bottlers were not taxable income. In Seven-Up, the bottlers were given exclusive territories, and it was not feasible for any\nlocal bottler to conduct a national services campaign. Determining that a national\nadvertising campaign would be beneficial, the bottlers decided to combine their funds\nfor that purpose. The program was funded by contributions from the participating\nbottlers based on the volume of their beverage sales. Because the advertising agency had no means to administer the bottlers\u2019 multiple\ncontributions, the agency recommended that the bottlers make payments to the\ncompany. The agency and the company then entered into an agreement setting forth\nthe arrangement. The company consistently represented that it was a trustee or\ncustodian of the bottlers\u2019 funds in the discussions leading to the implementation of the\nfund and thereafter. Each time product was shipped to a bottler, the company sent a\nstatement reflecting the bottler\u2019s required contribution to the advertising fund. In turn,\nthe company paid the agency for advertising.",

In turn,\nthe company paid the agency for advertising. The agency reported directly to the\nbottlers and provided the bottlers detailed information regarding the national advertising\nprogram. The company considered itself to be a nontaxable intermediary between the\nbottlers and the agency; therefore, the company did not report the bottlers\u2019 contributions\nto the fund as gross income or deduct the payments to the agency as business\nexpenses. The Service contended that the bottlers\u2019 contributions, reduced by the payments\nto the agency, were taxable income to the company. The Tax Court held that the\namounts contributed by the bottlers constituted a trust fund for advertising purposes and\nthat the company administered the fund as an agent for the bottlers. The court\nreasoned as follows: First, the members had contributed the funds to the cooperative for\nthe specific purpose of paying for the advertising campaign; second, the company had a\nlegal obligation to expend the funds for advertising and could not divert the funds for\nany other purpose; and, third, because of this obligation, the company derived no gain,\nprofit, or benefit upon the receipt of the funds. Consequently, the Tax Court held that \u201c\u2026\n[P]etitioner did not receive the bottlers\u2019 contribution as its own property. They were\nburdened with the obligation to use them for national advertising. No gain or profit was\nrealized on their receipt because of this offsetting obligation.\u201d See, Seven-Up, supra, 14\nT.C. at 979. Some of the facts of the instant case are similar to the facts of Seven-Up. For\nexample, in Seven-Up, the bottlers made payments based on the volume of their\nbeverage sales to the company that were earmarked for national advertising. In the\ninstant case, the members\u2019 contributions are also based on a percentage of sales and\nare used by A to pay for services. However, the critical facts are different. First, SevenUp did not involve gift check sales. Second, Seven-Up did not involve money inflows\nthat had not yet been taxed. Further, Seven-Up did not address the taxability of the POSTF-149051-10 15 sale of soft drinks to the public, but addressed only the taxability of contributions of\nbottlers\u2019 funds earmarked for advertising. Therefore, Seven-Up does not support A\u2019s\nargument that the full amount of taxable gift check sale proceeds are transformed into\nnontaxable members\u2019 contributions, deposits, or funds held-in-trust, simply because any\npotential profit from the transaction could be spent on services for the benefit of the A\nmembers. In short, the holding of the Seven-Up case does not address the taxability of\nthe sale of gift checks to the public. The income in question is not members\u2019 contributions but rather gift check sale\nproceeds. The Service has not reclassified any members\u2019 contributions into taxable\nincome. 8 In this case, the proceeds from the sale of gift checks derived from A\u2019s direct\nsales to the scrip organizations and public and from indirect sales through D stores. ----------------------percent of the Year 10 gift certificates and --- percent of the Year 11 gift\ncertificates were sold directly to third parties who are not members of A.",

A\nasserts that that this applies not only to the members\u2019 contributions, but also to gift\ncheck sales proceeds. The taxpayer\u2019s position ignores the fact that A is the entity that is\nselling gift checks, not the D stores. When D stores sell the gift checks to customers, D\nstores do not place the proceeds with the A as agent or trustee. We conclude that taxpayer\u2019s position that the gift check sales are nontaxable\nand its reliance on Seven-Up case for this conclusion are in error. We agree with\nExamination\u2019s determination that proceeds from gift card sales are taxable gross\nincome of A.\nIssue 2: A must include the proceeds it receives in income when the gift checks\nare sold to the public, third parties, or customers of D stores. IRC \u00a7451(a) sets forth the general rule that items of income must be recognized\nin the year of receipt \u201cunless, under the method of accounting used in computing\ntaxable income, such amount is to be properly accounted for as of a different period.\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a71.451-1(a) provides that, under an accrual method of accounting, income\nis includible in gross income when all the events have occurred that fix the right to\nreceive the income and the amount can be determined with reasonable accuracy. All the events that fix the right to receive income generally occur when (1) the\npayment is earned through performance, (2) payment is due to the taxpayer, or (3)\npayment is received by the taxpayer, whichever happens earliest. Rev. Rul. 84-31,\n1984-1 C.B. 127.\n8 If the contributions to the taxpayer from previously taxed sales to the public were at issue, then SevenUp, supra, would be on point, but only for those contributions. However, what is at issue in this case is the\ntaxability of previously untaxed gift check sales proceeds to the public and NOT member contributions\nthat have been already taxed to the A members. POSTF-149051-10 16 In determining whether the right to receive has become fixed, consideration must\nbe given to a number of factors.

See Schlude v. Commissioner, 372 U.S. 128 (1963);\nAmerican Automobile Assn. v. United States, 367 U.S. 687 (1981); Automobile Club of\nMichigan v. Commissioner, 353 U.S 180 (1957); and Hagen Advertising Displays, Inc. v.\nCommissioner, 407 F.2d 1105 (6th Cir. 1969). The cited Supreme Court cases dealt\nwith prepaid income for services rather than goods. The cases established the principle\nthat, except for certain limited exceptions, an accrual method taxpayer must include in\nincome amounts received for services even though the income had not yet been\nearned. Citing the trilogy of Supreme Court opinions, Hagen Advertising Displays, Inc.\nv. Commissioner, supra, held that a taxpayer must include in income prepaid amounts\nfor blanket orders for manufactured advertising signs in the year the taxpayer received\npayment. In the instant case, direct sales by A to the public or other third parties are\ncompleted sales of gift checks when A transfers the gift checks to the public or other\nthird party. Thus, A must include amounts from the sale of the gift checks in income\nupon the earlier of when A transfers the gift checks or when A receives payment,\nwhichever is first. Treas. Reg. \u00a71.451-1(a). Indirect sales of gift cards through D stores are initially nontaxable exchanges of\na cash equivalent for cash between A and D stores because the gift checks are\nnegotiable instruments that are payable to the order of any franchisor or franchisee\nrestaurant. 9 The sale of the gift checks occurs when D stores sell the gift checks to a\ncustomer or other third-party. Thus, for indirect sales, A must include amounts from the\n9 We emphasize, however, that an argument for immediate taxability could be made based on whether\nthe parties to the transaction, the A and the franchisees, understand the transaction to be a completed\nsale of gift checks between the parties, rather than deposits.

Issue 3: It is reasonable for the Service to determine that, in the absence of\nevidence to establish otherwise, gift checks provided by A to D stores for sale to\ncustomers have been sold the year the that A receives funds from D stores. It is reasonable to assume that D stores are unlikely to be advancing or\ndepositing money to be held-in-trust in exchange for gift checks that exceed the amount\nof gift checks that the D stores may sell. D stores do not want to keep excessive gift\nchecks on hand because they may be stolen, damaged, or lost. Just-in-Time-Inventory\nor a close approximation thereto, makes business sense because the gift checks are\nnot interest-bearing instruments. It is an accepted business principle that an entity\nwants to manage its cash and cash equivalents in a profitable manner by investing all\nnon-essential cash and cash equivalents. It is also reasonable to conclude that a D store will determine its inventory not\nless often than once a year, for purposes of determining its annual income and, in all\nlikelihood more frequently (to aid the taking of annual inventory through interim\ninventories or for financial statement preparation, interim or annual). In addition, as the\ntaxpayer is an association of the member franchisor and the franchisees and as the\ntaxpayer makes the gift check program available to participating members, it is\nreasonable to conclude that the taxpayer should be able to require its gift check\nparticipating members to provide information on the number of unsold gift checks on\nhand. An important factor to be considered is how often any one D store orders checks. It is reasonable to conclude that, when a store places a new order for gift checks, it is\nbecause it has sold all or almost all of its previously purchased gift checks to customers. The ordering party may always provide documentary evidence to the contrary. Therefore, it is reasonable for the Service to require A to establish by persuasive\ndocumentary evidence, including a reasonable estimate, the amount of gift check bank\naccount proceeds that represent unsold gift checks. In the absence of such evidence,\nwe conclude that it would be reasonable for the Service to determine that funds\nadvanced by D stores that remain in taxpayer\u2019s gift check bank accounts after a\nreasonable amount of time (e.g., for ----- days or more) represent gift check sales\nproceeds from sales by D stores to customers. There is no magical number; the figure ------ days is just one possible reasonable figure. What this reasonable amount of time is\nwould depend on the specific facts and circumstances.

The next issue is whether taxpayer may deduct its liability for gift check\nredemptions when it includes gift check proceeds in income. I.R.C. \u00a7461(a) provides\nthat the amount of any deduction or credit must be taken for the taxable year that is the\nproper taxable year under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income. Treas. Reg. \u00a71.461-1(a)(2)(i) provides that, under an accrual method of\naccounting, a liability is incurred, and is generally taken into account for federal income\ntax purposes, in the taxable year in which (1) all the events have occurred that establish\nthe fact of the liability, (2) the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable\naccuracy, and (3) economic performance has occurred with respect to the liability (the\n\"all events test\"). See also Treas. Reg. \u00a71.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(A). A taxpayer may not deduct a liability that is contingent, nor may a taxpayer\ndeduct an estimate of an anticipated expense, no matter how statistically certain, if it is\nbased on events that have not occurred by the close of the taxable year. United States\nv. General Dynamics, 481 U.S. 239, 243 (1987); Brown v. Helvering, 291 U.S. 193, 201\n(1934). In the instant case, until a customer returns to a D store to redeem a gift check, A\nfaces only a contingent liability to pay the redeeming D store. Thus, the return of the\ncustomer and redemption by the D store of the gift check is a condition precedent to\nestablish the taxpayer's liability. A may deduct the liability to make the payment to D\nstores no earlier than the time at which all events have occurred that establish the fact\nof the liability; namely, no earlier than when customers return to the D stores to redeem\nthe gift checks. At that time, A\u2019s liability will be fixed and determinable. Before the\ncustomers return to the D stores to redeem checks, all events have not occurred to\nestablish the fact of the liability and estimates of the amount of the liability are subject to\nthe vagaries inherent to gift check redemptions (e.g., if, and when, and in what\namounts, will the redemptions occur). Other considerations Finally, A maintains that there are costs directly attributable to the sale of gift\nchecks, mainly printing, storage, and bank fees that would exceed the gift check sales\nproceeds. The taxpayer may always claim any legitimate ordinary and necessary\nbusiness expenses under I.R.C. \u00a7162 and any other applicable provision. Assuming A\nis correct, the fact that its expenses may exceed its income and result in a loss activity,\ndoes not mean that the income is excludable in the first instance.
