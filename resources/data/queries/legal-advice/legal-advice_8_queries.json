On --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, the Court granted the motion for\nleave and filed --'s amendment to petition.

However, as\nstated above, -'s attorney received direct notice of -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'s amendment to petition in\nwhich she raised the innocent spouse defense, and -'s attorney was\npresent in Tax Court when the Court granted --'s motion to sever\nherself from the case as it related to her innocent spouse defense. On ------, the Tax Court entered a stipulated decision, signed by counsel for the IRS and by --'s attorney -------, which stated\nthat, pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6013(e), -- was not liable for any\ndeficiencies for the - through - tax years. (The citation to\nI.R.C. \u00a7 6013(e) was erroneous, because I.R.C. \u00a7 6015 replaced\nformer I.R.C. \u00a7 6013(e), effective for liabilities arising before,\nbut remaining unpaid as of July 22, -.) On -----, the Tax Court issued an opinion in -'s case, T.C.\nMemo. --, holding that - was not entitled to --- deductions claimed\nin taxable years - through -. (Outside the Tax Court proceedings,\n- and IRS agreed that the deductions were allowable in -.) A\ndecision in -'s Tax Court case for the - through - tax years was\nentered on -----.\nEdwin died in ---. His estate is in probate in -----------,\nCase No. --. The Service filed a claim in the probate court for\nthe - through - income tax deficiencies, in the amounts determined\nin the Tax Court decision which had been entered on ------------. The accountant for the estate now argues that - (and thus his\nestate) was denied due process because, contrary to the\nrequirements of I.R.C. \u00a7 6015, - was not given notice of -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'s innocent spouse\nproceedings, and was not allowed to participate in consideration of\nher innocent spouse claim at the administrative or judicial level. ANALYSIS As part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA\n98), Congress added I.R.C. \u00a7 6015, effective for tax liabilities\narising after July 22, 1998, or arising on or before July 22,\n1998, but remaining unpaid as of that date. Internal Revenue\nService Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206,\n\u00a7 3201(g)(1), 112 Stat. 685, 740 (1998). Section 6015(e)(4) contains the following provision:\n(4) Notice to Other Spouse. \u2013 The Tax Court shall\nestablish rules which provide the individual filing a\njoint return but not making the [an innocent spouse]\nelection under subsection (b)or (c) with adequate notice\nand an opportunity to become a party to a proceeding\nunder either such subsection. On January 26, 1999, the Tax Court issued interim rules regarding the new innocent spouse relief (Title XXXI, ACTIONS FOR\nDETERMINATION OF RELIEF FROM JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ON A JOINT\nRETURN, Interim Rules 320 through 325 of the Tax Court Rules of\nPractice and Procedure). Interim Rule 325(a) required the\nCommissioner to serve notice of the filing of the [Tax Court]\npetition [seeking relief from joint and several liability] on the\nother individual filing the joint return.",

      "content": "Interim Rule 325(a) required the\nCommissioner to serve notice of the filing of the [Tax Court]\npetition [seeking relief from joint and several liability] on the\nother individual filing the joint return. Interim Rule 325(b)\nallowed the non-requesting spouse to file a notice of intervention\nwith the Tax Court within 60 days after service of the notice by\nthe Commissioner of the filing of the [innocent spouse] petition. In this case, petitioners - and ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------jointly petitioned from a notice of\ndeficiency and Edwin was already a party to the case. Petitioner -----'s attorneys had actual notice of -----'s request for innocent\nspouse relief. --'s amended petition raising that issue was served\non -'s attorneys in ----, and -'s attorneys were present in Tax\nCourt in ---, when the Court severed -- from the case for the\nexpress purpose of allowing her to pursue her innocent spouse\ndefense. Although the Internal Revenue Service did not provide formal\nwritten notice to -----of -----'s innocent spouse claim, such\nnotice would have been superfluous on the facts of this case. -----------was at all times during 1998 and until at least ---------,\nrepresented by attorneys who were aware of ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'s innocent spouse claim. Counsel for petitioner ---- could have objected to petitioner -------------\u2019s motion to sever or alternatively, could have asserted\nthat - had a right to intervene in -----'s Tax Court case, as\nprovided in Interim Tax Court Rule 325. Counsel for -------elected\nnot to do so. Under former I.R.C. \u00a7 6013(e), the spouse not claiming relief\nlacked standing to challenge the innocent spouse relief granted to\nhis or her spouse in a judicial proceeding. Thus, under the law\nexisting when - and ------filed their petition on -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, it is clear that ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ would have had\nno right to challenge --\u2019s claim for innocent spouse relief. See\nGarvey v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1993-354; Himmelwright v.\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo 1988-114. Under I.R.C. \u00a7 6015, however, the spouse not claiming relief\nhas standing to challenge the granting of relief from joint and\nseveral liability to his or her spouse in a judicial proceeding. In Corson v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 354, 365 (2000), the Tax Court\nheld that the language of I.R.C. \u00a7 6015(e)(4) \u201cwas intended to\nconfer some participatory entitlement\u201d by the spouse not electing\nrelief from joint and several liability under I.R.C. \u00a7 6015. Petitioner -----'s attorney, ----, moved to sever ----------from\nthe case as it related to her innocent spouse defense on -------,\nalmost -- months after the enactment of I.R.C. \u00a7 6015. -------------and ------, counsel for ------, were both present in Tax Court\non -----, when the Court granted --'s motion to sever. Counsel for\n- could have objected to the severance of the case and asserted\nthat - had a right to participate in the litigation of -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u2019s claim for relief\nfrom joint and several liability under the newly enacted I.R.C.\n\u00a7 6015, but did not do so. Additionally, the Tax Court has also held that when a spouse\nraises a claim for relief under I.R.C. \u00a7 6015 in any judicial\nproceeding before the Tax Court, and the other spouse is not a\nparty to the case, the IRS must notify the nonpetitioning spouse of\nhis or her right to intervene.",

      "content": "Additionally, the Tax Court has also held that when a spouse\nraises a claim for relief under I.R.C. \u00a7 6015 in any judicial\nproceeding before the Tax Court, and the other spouse is not a\nparty to the case, the IRS must notify the nonpetitioning spouse of\nhis or her right to intervene. King v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 118\n(2000). In this case, however, petitioner --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------was already party when petitioner\n------raised the claim for relief under I.R.C. \u00a7 6015 in the Tax\nCourt proceeding. Thus, respondent was not required under I.R.C.\n\u00a7 6015 to notify - of --\u2019s claim for relief and -\u2019s right to\nintervene in --\u2019s case. The fact the counsel for ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------did not object to the\nseverance of --\u2019s case or assert -\u2019s right to participate --------------\u2019s determination of relief does not create a responsibility\non respondent to notify - of his right to become a party to the\ncase again. Note that in this case Mr. -- had actual knowledge of ----------------'s innocent spouse proceeding and was a party to that\nproceeding as he jointly petitioned. Also, - was at all times\nrepresented by counsel. If the Estate of -----wishes to challenge the Tax Court's\ngrant of innocent spouse relief to -----, then the Estate must either move for reconsideration of the decision in ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'s case or move to\nvacate the decision; either such motion would have to be filed in\nthe Tax Court. Based upon the discussion above, it is unlikely\nthat the Tax Court would reconsider or vacate its decision in -------------'s case. The probate court lacks jurisdiction to override or overrule\nthe Tax Court's judgment in -----'s case. The United States Courts\nof Appeal have exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the\nTax Court. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). The probate court is required\nunder principles of comity and federalism to honor the judgment of\nthe Tax Court. (Judicial comity is \"[t]he respect a court of one\nstate or jurisdiction shows to another state or jurisdiction in\ngiving effect to the other's laws and judicial decisions.\" Black's\nLaw Dictionary 262 (7th ed. 1999).) If, nonetheless, the probate court were to assert jurisdiction\nand rule that ------is jointly and severally liable with -----------for the - through - income tax deficiencies, the Internal\nRevenue Service could not collect from -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------individually. This is so because the\nTax Court relieved her of liability, and the Service is bound by\nthe Tax Court's decision. The Internal Revenue Service could,\nhowever, collect from ----- as transferee of assets from ----------'s estate. And, of course, the Estate of --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------is liable for the full amount of\nthe deficiencies regardless of whether ------is or is not relieved\nof liability.
