INTRODUCTION On May 23, 2012, you requested that we review an Agreement\nas a Determination Pursuant to Section 1313(a)(4) of the\nInternal Revenue Code (\u201cForm 2259\u201d) to ensure that you prepared\nit properly. Subsequently, by e-mail dated May 30, 2012, the\ntaxpayer\u2019s representative informed you that she no longer\nbelieves that a Form 2259 needs to be executed in this matter,\nsince there is a ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (\u201c-\u201d) and is,\ntherefore, a \"determination\" under I.R.C. \u00a7 1313(a).

ISSUES\n1. Whether the mitigation provisions of I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311 1314 apply to permit - to reduce the \u201camount of the bad debt\nsection 481(a) originally reported as income\u201d for - and - by $------- and $--, respectively, to \u201crevers[e] out the double\nreported income occurring as a result of ---------------------------.\u201d 2. If issue (1) is answered in the affirmative, whether a\nForm 2259 must be entered to effect a determination under I.R.C.\n\u00a7 1313 and the regulations thereunder. CONCLUSIONS 1. No, for the reasons explained below, the mitigation\nprovisions do not apply. Therefore, - cannot reduce its taxable\nincome by its overstatements of the ratable portion of positive\nsection 481(a) adjustments in the amounts of $---and ----------for the tax years ---- and - --, respectively. 2.

CC LB&I:--------------:POSTF-123135-12\n10\n3. Circumstance of Adjustment Authorized by I.R.C. \u00a7 1312 Third, the determination must result in a circumstance\nunder which an adjustment is authorized by I.R.C. \u00a7 1312. There\nare seven circumstances under which an adjustment is authorized\nby I.R.C. \u00a7 1312. - argues that its situation falls under\nI.R.C. \u00a7 1312(1), which involves double inclusion of an item of\ngross income. In the alternative, - also argues that the ------------- resulted in the double disallowance of a deduction or\ncredit within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 1312(4). A. I.R.C. \u00a7 1312(1) I.R.C. \u00a7 1312(1) authorizes a correction only when \u201c[t]he\ndetermination requires the inclusion in gross income of an item\nwhich was erroneously included in the gross income of the\ntaxpayer for another taxable year . . . .\u201d The language of\nI.R.C. \u00a7 1312(1) does not suggest that an adjustment is\nauthorized when a deduction is erroneously taken in one year and\nan item of gross income is erroneously reported in another year. In Schwartz v. United States, 67 F.3d 838 (9th Cir. 1995),\nthe Ninth Circuit faced the question whether an ordinary loss\nfor which a Tax Court decision disallowed a deduction was an\nitem which was erroneously included in gross income. The Court\nlimited gross income to the type of items listed in I.R.C. \u00a7 61,\nstating: We conclude that a deduction for an ordinary loss\nis not an item included in gross income. The Internal\nRevenue Code defines gross income as \u201call income from\nwhatever source derived....\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a). The\nrepresentative list that follows the statutory definition\nincludes only items that add wealth. 26 U.S.C. \u00a761(a)(1)\u2013\n(15). Under this definition of gross income, the\nSchwartzes' ordinary loss reported on their 1976 return\nis not an item included in gross income. Id. at 840. Likewise, in holding that failure to take depreciation\ndeductions did not constitute an erroneous inclusion in gross\nincome, the Tenth Circuit stated: The meaning of an item of gross income is, under\nSection 61 of the 1954 Code, limited to specific items and\ndoes not include everything that results in an increase in CC LB&I:--------------:POSTF-123135-12\n11\ntax. It is restricted to positive items and does not\ninclude negative elements such as deductions ... the\nomission of which results in increased taxes. Gardiner v.
