Whether the regulations promulgated pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 338 and 1060\nmodify the application of Temp. Treas.

Whether I.R.C. \u00a7 481 applies to tax all previously deferred income from the use\nof the installment method in the year under examination. CONCLUSIONS 1. The Year 10 transaction, in substance, is not a sale for tax purposes. 2. The non-recourse contingent payment notes do not constitute debt instruments. 3. Alternatively, if the form of the Year 10 transaction is respected:\nA. The regulations promulgated pursuant to Sections 338 and 1060 do not\nmodify the installment method of accounting to allow the equivalent of open\ntransaction reporting. B. The form of the transaction is a contingent payment asset sale for which the\nmaximum selling price is determinable and both \u00a7\u00a7 383 and 453A apply, as\naddressed below. 4. Section 481 applies to tax the previously deferred income in the year under\nexamination, as addressed below. FACTS\nA. Summary Most of the assets the subject of the Year 10 transaction were originally owned\nby Owner 1 ----------------, Owner 2 ---------------, and Owner 3 ----------------via a S\ncorporation. Owners 1 through 3 sold ** percent of their stock in the S corporation to a\nthird party for approximately $ **, with an I.R.C. \u00a7 338(h)(10) election. In ** years the\ncorporation was in bankruptcy, with suspended lawsuits among and between the third\nparty purchaser, Owners 1 through 3, and others.

The new non-profit had no assets prior to\nthe \u201cpurchase\u201d of the assets.

After 1 year, the $ CC Non-Recourse Contingent Payment Working Capital Note\nterminates and, after P years, all liabilities for payments under the $ DD Non-Recourse\nContingent Payment Term Note are extinguished; but, it is not clear who will retain the\n\u201csold\u201d assets. 1 If the non-profit breaches any of the 10 terms summarized above, it is in\ndefault and subject to various \u201cpenalties,\u201d as addressed below. 1 The non-profit and the principals should be the subject of a referral to the exempt organization division\nto consider (1) whether the non-profit is organized and operated for a tax exempt purpose and not for the\nsubstantial private benefit of individuals; (2) whether the Corp F principals with a high salary and positions\nat the non-profit are subject to excise taxes for excess benefit transactions under I.R.C. \u00a7 4958 as Page 5 of 37 POSTF-134629-07 B.

It may be as a result of, or prior to, this lawsuit that Owners 1, 2\nand 3 made a $ WW cash infusion to Corp E and were forced to surrender some of their\n** percent stock holding. Owners 1, 2 and 3 countersued Entity G, alleging breach of\nfiduciary duty and business losses from Entity G\u2019s running of the businesses. In ** of Year 9, Corp E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 4 The bankruptcy stayed\nthe lawsuits. Subsequently, Corp E owners did recover some money; but, the recovery\nagainst former Owners 1, 2 and 3 was limited by a clause in the sale contract. There\nwas a significant recovery from PP. The amounts recovered are not known. Prior to, and at the time of the Chapter 11 filing, Corp E was YY throughout the\nUnited States; however, all ZZ ------------------- were released from non-compete clauses ------------------------------------------------to work with competitors upon filing for bankruptcy.

It is not known whether, at the\ntime of the bankruptcy asset purchase, it was planned to dispose of the assets to, or\nthrough, a tax-exempt entity. C. Year 10 Transaction In Year 9, KK University, a legitimate operating private university in JJ, formed a\npurported I.R.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) entity called Entity M. As far as it is known, KK University\ncontributed no assets to Entity M. It is not known whether Entity M was formed before\nor after Corp F acquired the bankruptcy assets for $ T. Nor is it known what contact or\nnegotiations there were between KK University and Corp F. It is known that, prior to\nthe Year 10 transaction, Entity M did not hold any assets of significance. In Year 10, Corp F, in form, sold some of the assets it had acquired for $ T to\nEntity M for a $ DD Non-Recourse Contingent Payment Term Note, as further detailed\nbelow. It is not known whether there were any negotiations with regard to the selling\nprice, how the selling price was determined, or why Entity M was willing to pay over\n$ EE more for the assets than Corp F paid ** months before at the auction sale. 5 The\nauditing revenue agent asserts the confidentiality agreement, required of Entity M as set\nforth below, is the reason this information is not available. Entity M is operated by Owner 2 (one of the three former principals of Corp D)\nand the former Corp F employees, with Owner 2 the CEO of Entity M. Owners 1, 2 and\n3, the original shareholders of Corp D (which was, in effect, sold twice, once to Entity G\nand once to Entity M) are receiving W-2 wages for operating Entity M. This\narrangement is pursuant to requirements imposed on Entity M, as addressed further\nbelow. In Year 12, Owner 2 received $ ** in W-2 wage, with both Owners 1 and 3\nreceiving $ ** in wages; however, it is not known what, if any, services Owners 1 and 3\nprovided. 5 The $ EE is the $ DD Non-Recourse Contingent Payment Term Note amount less $ FF (the $ T auction\ncost of the assets less the $ GG that Corp F allocated to the acquired W that it retained). The use of the\nCorp F allocation of purchase price to the W does not imply, and no inference can be drawn, that this is\nthe Ws\u2019 value. It is not known whether this was an unilateral Corp F allocation but, it may be understated\ngiven the W were probably the most valuable asset acquired in the auction. Page 8 of 37 POSTF-134629-07",

I.R.C. \u00a7 1001(a). The \u201camount realized\u201d is \u201cthe sum of any money received\nplus the fair market value of the property (other than money) received.\u201d I.R.C.\n\u00a7 1001(b). Accordingly under said section, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this\nsubtitle, the entire amount of the gain or loss, determined under this section on the sale\nor exchange of property shall be recognized.\u201d This is the general rule, with any\ndeferrals or exceptions a matter of legislative grace. For gain from debt instruments issued for property, Treas. Reg. \u00a71.1001-1(g)(1)\nprovides, in general, that \u201c[i]f a debt instrument is issued in exchange for property, the\namount realized attributable to the debt instrument is the issue price of the debt\ninstrument as determined under [Treas. Reg.] \u00a7\u00a71.1273-2 or 1.1274-2, whichever is\napplicable.\u201d Said provision is not applicable to a debt instrument subject to Treas. Reg.\n\u00a7\u00a71.1275-4(c) or 1.483-4.

Section 453(a) provides\nthat, except as otherwise stated, income from an installment sales shall be taken into\naccount under the installment method. Section 453(b)(1) defines an installment sale as\na disposition of property where at least one payment is to be received after the close of\nthe taxable year in which the disposition occurs. Section 453(c) defines the installment\nmethod as a method of accounting under which the income is recognized for any\ntaxable year from a disposition of property being that proportion of the payments\nreceived in that year which the gross profit (realized or to be realized when the payment\nis completed) bears to the total contract price. Section 453(j)(2) provides that the\nSecretary of the Treasury shall prescribe regulations providing for ratable basis\nrecovery in transactions where the gross profit or the total contract price (or both)\ncannot readily be ascertained. Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a715A.453-1(c)(1) defines the term \u201ccontingent payment sale\u201d\nas a sale or other disposition of property in which the aggregate selling price cannot be\ndetermined by the close of the taxable year in which the sale or other disposition\noccurs. In general, non-dealers with a contingent payment sale report income pursuant\nto the installment sale method of accounting by allocating payments received among:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Gain\nPartial return of basis\nInterest (imputed or internal, as applicable) I.R.C. \u00a7 453; Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-1. The term \u201ccontingent payment sale\u201d does not include transactions with respect to\nwhich the installment obligation represents, under applicable principles of tax law, a\nretained interest in the property which is the subject of the transaction, an interest in a\njoint venture or a partnership, an equity interest in a corporation or similar transactions,\nregardless of the existence of a stated maximum selling price or fixed payment terms. Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a715A.453-1(c)(1). The regulations promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 453\ndistinguish a sale from the acquisition of an equity interest, with an equity interest not a\ndebt instrument.

As stated in Estate of Franklin v.\nCommissioner, 64 T.C. 752 (1975), aff\u2019g Estate of Franklin v. Commissioner, 544 F.2d\n1045, 1047 n.1 (1976):\n\u201c[W]hile characteristics of a transaction are questions of fact,\nwhether those characteristics constitute a sale for tax\npurposes is a question of law\u201d (emphasis in original, citations\nomitted) To paraphrase the reasoning in Estate of Franklin, the lack of a price that\napproximately equals the fair market value leaves the transaction lacking the substance\nto justify treating the transaction as a sale ab initio. 544 F.2d at 1048. Whether or not\nCorp F (through Owners 1, 2 and 3) believed that the businesses formerly acquired by\nEntity G could be worth $ DD after the bankruptcy, there is no evidence the few assets\nfrom the business that Corp F allegedly sold could be worth $ DD at the time of the\npurported sale. The fact the \u201csold\u201d assets were purchased for approximately $ R ($ T\nless retained W) 23 in an arms length, open bid, hotly contested auction ** months\nearlier is compelling evidence that the assets were only worth $ R. If Corp F could not\nmake a go of the business without the Z that a non-profit organization could command,\nthat is additional evidence the value did not increase over $ EE24 in the intervening **\nmonths that Corp F held the assets. Moreover, while Corp F asserts that the increased value ($ EE) is either going\nconcern or goodwill, the evidence is to the contrary. As noted above, Corp F allegedly\ncould not make a \u201cgo\u201d of the business without Entity M. From a review of the list of\nshort-term AA contracts, it appears that the AA contracts are old or relatively few. Most\nof the BB agreements and ZZ contracts pre-date the purchase of the assets in the\nbankruptcy auction. All ZZ were released from their non-compete clauses prior to the\nbankruptcy auction. It will take future development to turn these assets into a $ DD\nbusiness, if such a success is possible. To the extent Corp F is anticipating creating\ngoodwill by running the business through Entity M for P years that does not bring Year\n10 value to the purported sale of miscellaneous older assets. 23 The $ R is, in exact amounts, $ R. This amount is based on Corp F\u2019s representation it paid $ T for all of\nthe assets acquired in the bankruptcy auction with $ GG of said $ T paid for the W. The W were retained\nby Corp F. If the amount allocated to the W was not a negotiated arms length amount, said amount may\nbe too low of an allocation because W are probably the most valuable asset acquired. 24 $ DD less $ R.

Commissioner\n67 T.C. 576 (taxpayers not entitled to deferral benefits of \u00a7 453 because they did not\nestablish the transfer was a bona fide sale for tax purposes in substance as well as\nform). Thus, there is no sale for tax purposes; rather, Corp F continues, in substance, to\nown all the assets with all income of the business income of Corp F. Corp F used a\nmethod of accounting (installment method) that failed to clearly reflect its income from\nits business that it continued to run. While only the Year 13 is under audit, all deferred\nincome from Year 10-Year 12 can be included in Year 13 as set forth in Section 5,\nApplicability of \u00a7 481, below. The economic substance doctrine, applied above, disregards the transaction, i.e.,\nthere is no sale. The doctrine of substance over form recasts the transaction. As a first\nalternative, you should recast the transaction. Assuming arguendo the Z could be a\nsignificant expense reduction necessary to generate profits, the transaction would be\nrecast as Corp F and Entity M having entered into a partnership that failed to file any tax\nreturns, with Corp F the ** percent income partner and Entity M the ** percent income\npartner pursuant to the allocation of the \u201cProfit,\u201d and taxed accordingly. As a second\nalternative, you should assert Corp F and Entity M formed a C corporation, with the\nmirror stock plan and holder certificates representing the corporate shares. For that\nalternative, the corporation failed to file corporate tax returns, failed to pay the corporate\nlevel tax and failed to pay the shareholder level tax. 25 All ------------------------------------------------- would be dividends subject to a second level of tax, and should be taxed\naccordingly. As support for both the position that Corp F, in substance, retained ownership of\nthe assets and the positions that it formed new entities with Entity M, it is noted that\nCorp F provides the working capital to run the business. Entity M has no right to run the\nbusiness; rather, one of the owners of Corp F must be the CEO and Entity M must hire\nthe Corp F employees or Entity M is in default under the terms of the Note Agreement. Entity M cannot sell the assets it purportedly purchased and would, presumably, forfeit\nall assets back to Corp F in the event of a default. The default provisions are strict \u2013 in\nessence giving Corp F complete control.

Likewise, based on the facts, neither the $ DD Non-Recourse Contingent Payment\nTerm Note nor the $ CC Non-Recourse Contingent Payment Working Capital Note are\ncontingent payment debt instruments. While the absence of personal liability by Entity M does not cause the note, ipso\nfact, to be a non bona fide debt, as in Estate of Franklin, because the debt has\neconomic significance only if the business generates substantial profits, there has been\nno creation of an instrument that\nsecured \u2018the use or forbearance of money.\u2019 (citations\nomitted) Nor has the seller advanced money or forborne its\nuse.

In general, the gross profit is the selling price less the seller\u2019s adjusted\nbasis (including expenses of sale). The gross profit factor (percentage) is the gross\nprofit divided by the contract price. Said gross profit factor is applied to the aggregate\ncontingent payment amounts received in each taxable period/year to arrive at the\nannual reportable gain, after allocation to interest, as discussed below. There are\nspecific rules for computing the initial selling price, contract price and gross profit. The\napplicable regulation section depends on whether the transaction constitutes a sale for\nwhich: (a) the maximum selling price is determinable, (b) the maximum selling price is\nnot determinable but the time over which payment will be received is determinable, or\n(c) neither a maximum selling price nor a definite term is determinable.

If inventory was transferred, it is\nexcluded from the installment sale provision. \u00a7 453(b)(2)(B); Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-(b)(4). See\nC.W. Murry v. Commissioner, T.C.

Corp F cannot claim it purchased inventory, in bulk, from the\nbankruptcy proceeding as an investment for the purpose of turning over a profit given the assets were\nused in its trade or business. See W.F. Glisson v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1981-379 (the character of\nthe parts sold changed from inventory to investment assets based on the facts).

Corp F has overstated its basis in that the value of the retained W must be\nsubtracted from the claimed basis of $ T.

The\none gross profit ratio, computed with the correct amounts, applies to each principal\npayment starting with the very first payment; there is no separate zero percent gross\nprofit ratio for the initial principal payments. This position should be asserted as an\nalternative to the treatment in issue one, above, if the case is unagreed. Corp F concurs that, if a sale, the form of its transaction is a contingent payment\nsale with Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-1(c) applicable, but argues the sale is divisible\ninto seven separate sales with potentially seven different gross profit ratios, applied\nserially. According to Corp F, each sale represents a sale of assets within a single\nasset class. Corp F argues that separate sale treatment with different gross profit ratios\nis mandated by Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1060-1(c)(2) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.338-6. Thus, Corp F\nconcludes it can treat payments up to the fair market value in each separate class as a\nseparate sale with the result that no gain is reportable, at all, until it starts receiving\npayments for the Class VII asset sale. In other words, in effect, the one gross profit\nratio correctly computed as stated above, cannot apply to any payment until $ T cash is\nreceived tax free because the first six sales have a zero gross profit ratio in that the cost\nbasis equals the selling price in each sale. Corp F relies primarily upon Priv. Ltr. Rul. 200004040 (October 29, 1999) to\nsupport its position. 2000 WL 92408 (IRS PLR) issued January 28, 2001/October 29,\n1999. PLR 200004040 addresses six ruling requests with respect to application of\nI.R.C. \u00a7 468 on nuclear decommissioning and its interrelationship with I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 671678 (grantor trusts), \u00a7 165, and \u00a71060. Corp F focuses on ruling request number four\nwherein the PLR addresses the acquiring taxpayer\u2019s basis in nonqualified\ndecommissioning funds in the context of the first three rulings on \u00a7 468. Corp F applies\nthe rulings with respect to the purchaser to itself, as seller, relying on conformity of\ntreatment. The taxpayer-purchaser in the PLR argued \u00a7 1060 did not apply so the assumed\ndecommissioning liability could be allocated to its cost basis in the nonqualified funds. In response, the PLR notes that the assumed liability cannot be treated as incurred for\nfederal income tax purposed until economic performance, citing to Reg. \u00a7\u00a71.4461(c)(1)(i)(ii)(A) and 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), then finding economic performance does not\noccur for decommissioning obligations until the costs are incurred in satisfaction of the\nliability \u2013 an event that may not occur for sixty years in the situation addressed. Hence\nthe basis was limited to the cash component. 27 There is a possibility the working capital note could be a contribution to capital; however, there are\ninsufficient facts to support that treatment as the case is presented.

Page 29 of 37 POSTF-134629-07 The PLR then addressed how to allocate the cash component, rejecting the\npurchasing taxpayer\u2019s attempt to first divide the sale in two sales, i.e., plant assets and\ndecommissioning fund liability, with all basis to the plant assets. The PLR rejected the\ndivisibility argument as having no support. 28 Nowhere does the PLR address \u00a7 453 or\nstate the residual method allows, in essence, open transaction reporting for the seller by\ndividing one sale into separate sales. While PLR 20004040 is too inter-twined with the special provisions on nuclear\npower plants to be considered as supporting Corp F, to the extent a non-citable nonprecedential PLR could be binding authority (it cannot), the applicable principle from the\nPLR would be that, as the taxpayer in the ruling could not arbitrarily bifurcate its\ntransaction, Corp F cannot arbitrarily bifurcate its transaction into seven separate sales. The PLR provides no support for Corp F\u2019s argument that \u00a7 453 allows a seller\u2019s\nreporting of gain be separated into seven separate sales to avoid the ratable basis\nrecovery rules of \u00a7 453. Corp F also relies on Williams v. McGowan, 152 F.2d 570 (2d Cir. 1945), to claim\nthat \u00a7 453 applies asset by asset, and on Rev. Rul. 68-13, 1968-1 C.B. 195,197 which\nstates:\n[T]he sale of a business must be \u2018comminuted into its\nfragments\u2019 where either the selling price or the down\npayment, or both of them, is separately stated with respect\nto different assets or types of assets in the agreement of\nsale. In this connection, it also should be noted that losses,\nwhere separately determinable, must be reported in the year\nof sale. (citation omitted)\nRev. Rule 68-13 is not saying a taxpayer can divide a single transaction for\nimmediate loss recognition and deferral of gain, or that the ratable basis recovery rules\nare moot. The ruling must be placed in the context of the citation in the ruling to\nMonaghan v. Commissioner, 40 T.C. 680 (1963), acq. 1964-2 C.B. 3 and Williams v.\nMcGowan, 152 F.2d 570 (2nd Cir. 1945). These cases considered the exclusion of\ninventory from installment reporting and the old requirement that, in the year of sale,\npayments cannot exceed 30 percent of the price. Neither this revenue ruling nor the\ncases nullify the ratable basis reporting required by \u00a7 453 as amended in Year 5 for\ncontingent payment sales; these authorities are directed at determining the character of\nthe gain and the old 30 percent rule. 28 The \u00a7 1060 regulations relative to the residual method require the allocation to Classes IIV pro rata\naccording to their fair market value, and addresses the impact of the buyer\u2019s satisfaction of economic\nperformance of liabilities assumed on the purchase price.

Williams, above, a 1945 case, also does not moot \u00a7 453; rather, said case\naddresses the question of how the character of the gain is reported \u2013 as ordinary or\ncapital income based on the assets involved. See General Counsel Memorandum\ndated April 19, 1982, GCM 38838, 1982 WL 204258 (IRS-GCM) (\u00a7 III, Application of the\nMass or Indivisible Asset Concept, interpreting Williams). Corp F also relies on Robert H. Wellen, Contingent Consideration and\nContingent Liabilities in Acquisitions, in Method of Calculating Gain Recognition, in\nVolume IV 2006, at 9, Chapter 44, (PLI Tax Law and Estate Planning Series Tax Law\nand Practice Course Handbook Series NO. J-716, 2006). Corp F focuses on \u00a7 I. C. 4\n\u201cMethod of Calculating Gain Recognition\u201d. However, said section confirms, in\n\u00a7 1.C.4.c, that under \u00a7 453 the seller must recognize gain on each payment using the\ngross profit ratio, with a proviso on interest reporting. Contrary to Corp F\u2019s\ninterpretation, \u00a71.C.4.d does not assert \u00a7 1060 applies to the seller for purposes of\ntrumping \u00a7 453 gross profit reporting requirements. Rather \u00a7 1.C.4.e notes with a\nPage 31 of 37 POSTF-134629-07\nmaximum selling price contingent sale, Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-1(c)(2)(3) defers\nbasis recovery and accelerates gain.",

[and the courts ultimately] found the\ntransaction[s] to be sham[s] in substance. . . Turning to the specific regulations cited by Corp F, Reg \u00a71.1060-1(c)(1), said\nregulation provides\n[T]he seller\u2019s consideration is the amount in the aggregate,\nrealized from selling the assets in the applicable asset\nacquisition under section 1001(b). The purchaser\u2019s\nconsideration is the amount, in the aggregate, of its cost of\npurchasing the assets in the applicable asset acquisition that\nis properly taken into account in basis. (emphasis added) No place does this or any other subsection of Reg. \u00a7 1.1060 address \u00a7 453. No place\ndoes this or any other subsection of Reg. \u00a7 1.1060 asserts that the sale can be\nbifurcated into separate sales of each class of assets. Rather, Reg. \u00a7 1.1060-1(c)(2)\nprovides that the amount realized for each asset is determined by allocation the\nconsideration to all assets using the residual method under Treas. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 1.338-6 and\n1.338-7. Thus, contrary to the contentions of Corp F, the regulations under \u00a7 1060 do\nnot support its interpretation of the application of \u00a7 453. For purposes of allocating the aggregate deemed sale price (\u201cADSP\u201d) and\nadjusted gross-up basis (\u201cAGUP\u201d), Reg. \u00a7 1.338-6(a) provides, generally, that fair\nmarket value is the gross fair market value without regard to liabilities; it does not define\nfair market value. Reg. \u00a7 1.338-6(b) addresses allocating the consideration (ADSP)\namong the seven classes of assets, but no where does said regulation address \u00a7 453 or\ninfer each asset class is to be treated as a separate, stand alone, sale for purposes of\napplying \u00a7 453. Rather, said regulation provides the total consideration paid is first\nreduced for Class I Assets (cash and general deposit accounts as further elaborated on\nin the regulation) then allocated among the other classes of assets in proportion to their\nfair market value, on an asset class by asset class basis. Asset classes II through VII\nare defined in Reg. \u00a7 1.338-6(b)(2)(ii) through (vii). Reg. \u00a7 1.338-6(c) provides that\nclass asset allocations are not to exceed fair market value, again, without defining fair\nPage 32 of 37 POSTF-134629-07\nmarket value. Fair market value is the amount a hypothetical buyer would pay and a\nhypothetical seller would accept both being appraised of all relevant facts.",

Bank One v.\nCommissioner, 120 T.C. 174, 308-310 (2003) aff\u2019d, in part, vacated in part (on other\ngrounds), remanded in part (on other grounds), (rehearing en banc denied) JPMorgan\nChase v. Commissioner 458 F.3d 564 (7th Cir. 2006), decisions re-entered on remand,\nappeal pending. Thus, contrary to the contentions of Corp F, Reg. \u00a7 1.338-6 does not nullify the\ntemporary regulations promulgated for contingent payment sales subject to \u00a7 453 which\nwas specifically amended in Year 5 to mandate ratable basis recovery in contingent\npayment sales rather than open transaction reporting. Reg. \u00a71.338-7 addresses situations when there must be a redetermination of\nADSP or AGUB, but does not set forth when a redetermination is required other than to\nrefer to general principles of tax law. Said regulation, also, does not modify the\nreporting under \u00a7 453. Moreover, the computation of interest for a contingent payment\nsale does not fall under this regulation as Reg. \u00a71.338-7(e) makes clear when it states\n\u201cFor rules characterizing deferred contingent payments as principal or interest, see\n\u00a7\u00a7 1.483-4, 1.1274-2(g), and 1.1275-4(c).\u201d Thus, Corp F errs in its analysis. The proper application of \u00a7 453 to the form of\nthe Year 10 transaction is a set forth at the beginning of this Section 3, above. Section 4 Application of \u00a7 483 and \u00a7 453A I.R.C. \u00a7 483 applies to a contract for the sale or exchange of property which has\na payment more than ** months after the date of the sale, with a payment due more\nthan one year after the sale subject to imputed interest where there is unstated interest. \u00a7 483(c). Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.483-4(a) provides \u00a7 483 applies to contingent payment sales\neven if the contract provides for adequate stated interest, with all contingent payments\ncharacterized as principal and interest under rules similar to Reg. \u00a7 1.1275-4(c)(4). Corp F should have computed \u201cinternal interest\u201d pursuant to the maximum selling\nprice regulations. Corp F must apply the \u201cprice-interest computation rule\u201d of Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 15A.453-1(c)(2)(ii). The \u201cinternal interest:\u201d must be recomputed pursuant\nto the regulations. All interest from application of \u00a7 483 is ordinary income. The balance of each\npayment is divided between principal and gain applying the correct gross profit ratio, as\naddressed in Section 3, above. Thus, the result is that for each payment Corp F must\nreport interest under \u00a7 483 and, if the entire payment is not interest, gain, with the gain\namount obtained from multiplying the remaining amount of each payment in each Corp Page 33 of 37 POSTF-134629-07 F year by the correct gross profit ratio computed as set forth in the beginning of Section\n3, above. 29\nGiven Corp F is a non-dealer and the sales price exceeds $ ** with each\nshareholder to receive in excess of $ ** (\u00a7 453A(B)(2)(B1)), 30 the transaction is also\nsubject to the interest imposed by \u00a7 453A. Pursuant to \u00a7 453A(a)(1), interest must be\npaid on the deferred tax liability as a surcharge.",

      "content": "Pursuant to \u00a7 453A(a)(1), interest must be\npaid on the deferred tax liability as a surcharge. No regulations have yet been issued\non how to apply \u00a7 453A in the context of a contingent payment sale. Given there is\nnothing that keeps the statute open for a \u201crefund\u201d if the sale price is overestimated,31 the\nappropriate computation is to \u201clook back\u201d at the end of each year to compute the\ninterest Corp F must pay. Section 5 Applicability of \u00a7 481 Section 453 prescribes a method of accounting. Corp F and its shareholders\nfailed to qualify for \u00a7 453 because there was no sale. Accordingly, its method of\naccounting failed to clearly reflect income. Pursuant to \u00a7 446, the Commissioner can\nplace the taxpayers on a method of accounting that does clearly reflect income. Section\n1 of this memorandum sets forth the tax principals that dictate the method of accounting\nthat does clearly reflect income. The Commissioner can and should impose an I.R.C.\n\u00a7 481 adjustment for all income deferred using the installment method from Year 10\nthrough Year 12, for each alternative position. The \u00a7 481 adjustment shall be included\nin income in the Year 13 so that all income that was improperly deferred by reporting\nincome under a method that failed to clearly reflect income is returned to income in Year\n13.32 If the taxpayer continues to assert the transaction constitutes a sale for tax\npurposes, a \u00a7 481 adjustment should be asserted for the alternative position addressed\nin Sections 3 and 4, above. See Huffman v. Commissioner, 126 T.C. 322, 340-41, 343,\n347-48, 350-51, 353-55 (2006) (addressing \u00a7 481). 29 While no facts were provided that evidence Corp F is subject to recapture income for amounts which\nwould be treated as \u00a7\u00a7 1245 or 1250 ordinary income during its ** month holding period for the\ninvestment assets sold to Entity M, if such facts exist, please be aware that the recapture rules of \u00a7\u00a7 1245\nand 453 override \u00a7 453. All recapture income, even if not received, must be recognized in the year of\nsale. \u00a7 453(i).\n30 See TAM9853002, Issue 2 (each shareholders\u2019 allocable portion of face amount of $DD controls\napplicability). 31 See TAM9853002, 1998 WL 908368 (IRS TAM) (no refund allowable based on overstated interest). Thus, a \u201clook back\u201d rule protects from up-front overstated interest. 32 Corp F does not qualify to spread the income adjustment over multiple years.
