A\nsignificant number of these long-term contracts were entered\nprior to, and during, the tax years currently under examination\n(taxable years ending December 31, -,\nDecember 31, -, and December 31, -).

Relevant Contracts Taxpayer's long-term contracts relevant to the ETI issue\nwere entered under both of the systems by which foreign\ngovernments may acquire U.S. defense articles and services:\n(1) government-to-government Foreign Military Sales; and\n(2) contractor-to-government Direct Commercial Sales. Foreign Military Sales (\u201cFMS\u201d)\nAs described in a United States General Accounting Office\nReport to the Secretary of Defense:\nThe Arms Export Control Act gives the President\nauthority to sell defense articles and services to\neligible foreign countries, generally at no cost to\nthe U.S. government. While the Defense Security\nCooperation Agency (DSCS) has overall responsibility\nfor administering the FMS program, the Army, Navy, and\nAir Force generally execute the sales agreementscommonly referred to as sales cases. Foreign military sales are made on an individual\ncase basis. A foreign country representative\ninitiates a case by sending a letter of request to DOD\n[Department of Defense] asking for information, such\nas the price and availability of goods, training,\ntechnical assistance, follow-on support, or other\nservices. Once the customer decides to proceed with\nthe purchase, DOD prepares a Letter of Offer and\nAcceptance (LOA) stating the terms of the sale for the\nitems and services being provided. After the LOA is\naccepted, the FMS customer is generally required to\npay, in advance, amounts necessary to cover costs\nassociated with the services or items purchased from\nDOD.

(United States General Accounting Office Report to the\nSecretary of Defense, Foreign Military Sales, Air Force\nControls Over the FMS Program Need Improvement,\nMay 2000 (GAO/AIMD-00-101).) After the U.S. Government and the foreign purchaser sign the\nLOA, except for items supplied directly from Department of\nDefense inventory, the U.S. Government buys the desired item or\nweapon system from a U.S. contractor on behalf of the foreign\ngovernment, employing essentially the same procurement criteria\nas if the item/system was being purchased for U.S. needs. The\nU.S. Government, not the foreign government, selects the source\nand manages the award contract, consistent with the provisions of\nthe Federal Acquisition Regulations (\u201cFAR\u201d) and the applicable\nLOA. FMS and Department of Defense orders often are consolidated\nto obtain economy-of-scale buys thereby significantly lowering\nunit prices. In some instances, ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, the U.S. Government procures goods\nfor sales to foreign countries by the execution of bilateral\nmodifications to its existing contracts. 2 2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. CC:LM:HMT:--------:POSTF-103313-03 page 5 Some of Taxpayer\u2019s FMS contracts for military equipment and\nservices are funded, in whole or part, by U.S. Government\nsubsidies. 3\nDirect Commercial Sales (\u201cDCS\u201d)4 In a DCS, a U.S. contractor and a foreign government or\nforeign entity enter into a direct contract in accordance with\nU.S. laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws and\nregulations, and provisions of international commercial law. The\nU.S. Government is not a party to DCS contracts. In a DCS, the\nforeign government or foreign entity selects the U.S. contractor\nand manages the contract directly with that U.S. contractor. Common Elements of FMS and DCS Transactions The long-term contracts under consideration are generally\nfixed-price contracts with fixed payment schedules, thereby\nenabling the purchaser to know the final price at the time of\ncontract signature. Since the specific configuration of military\nequipment sold is defined in the FMS or DCS contract, U.S.\ncontractors do not produce items in anticipation of military\nequipment sales and generally do not maintain an inventory of\ndefense articles. Pursuant to FMS and DCS contract provisions,\nagencies of the U.S. Government and other customers generally\nhave title to, or a security interest in, inventories related to\nsuch contracts as a result of advances or progress payments. 5\nFMS and DCS contracts are subject to extensive legal and\nregulatory requirements and, from time to time, agencies of the\nU.S. Government investigate whether a U.S. contractor\u2019s\noperations are being conducted in accordance with these\nrequirements. 3 Subsidized sales generally are not eligible for favorable tax treatment\nunder either the FSC or ETI tax r\u00e9gimes. Although contracts for some\nsubsidized sales were included in Taxpayer's initial ETI claims, Taxpayer\nagrees subsidized sales are not eligible for favorable treatment under either\nr\u00e9gime (with the exception of subsidized sales with \u201cthe possibility of\ncompetitive bidding\u201d (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.924(a)-1T(g)(3)) and is revising its\nclaims accordingly. 4 The U.S. Government uses the term DCS to identify this type of contract. ---------------------------------------------------------. 5 -- Taxpayer notes that, in some instances, progress payments may be treated as\nloans from the U.S. Government.

CC:LM:HMT:--------:POSTF-103313-03 page 6 Any foreign acquisition of U.S. defense items requires prior\napproval by the U.S. Government. A variety of procedural\nregulations govern the manner in which both marketing and sales\napproval must be obtained. For example, with respect to many\ncontracts for the sale of military equipment which has not been\npreviously approved for export, before a company can make a sales\nproposal to a prospective foreign purchaser, approval must be\nobtained from the Department of State.6 A favorable decision\nwould permit a U.S. contractor to conduct unclassified\ndiscussions and to make a sales proposal involving the sale of a\nspecific item of military equipment to a particular country. An\napproval, however, is not required if the specific item of\nequipment has been previously approved for export to any foreign\ncountry. Where such export has been previously approved, the\nDepartment of State must be notified in writing 30 days in\nadvance of the intended sale presentation or proposal. Neither Department of State approval nor the 30-day\nnotification discussed in the prior paragraph authorizes the\nactual export of defense articles or services. Such exports are\nauthorized only after a munitions export license is obtained from\nthe Office of Defense Trade Controls in the Department of State. An application for such a license must be accompanied by a copy\nof a purchase order, letter of intent, or other appropriate\ndocuments describing the sale. The U.S. Congress must be\nnotified of all cases for which the Office of Defense Trade\nControls intends to issue an export license for the sale of any\nmajor defense equipment or services which meet or exceed the\nstatutory dollar value thresholds established in the Arms Export\nControl Act of 1976 (AECA), 22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq., and related\nlegislation. This notification requirement applies to proposed\nFMS and DCS sales. 7 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------6 This requirement does not apply to NATO governments or to Australia, New\nZealand, or Japan. 7 The AECA requires that Congress be provided a total of 30 days notification\nprior to the authorization to export by either FMS or DCS any major defense\nequipment valued at $14 million or more. The statutory notification period\nis 15 days for NATO, NATO member countries, Japan, Australia, or New Zealand.

Another consideration for both FMS and DCS involves\ncomponents which are provided under Department of Defense\ncontracting procedures to U.S. defense contractors as governmentfurnished equipment (GFE) or material (GFM). Such items are\ngenerally incorporated by the U.S. contractor into larger systems\nwhich are then sold. Under the FMS system, the Department of\nDefense provides GFE or GFM directly to the prime contractor on\nan equal priority basis for both U.S. and foreign requirements,\nand the Department of Defense coordinates the production of the\nend item.

Under this\nmethod, a percentage of the total contract revenue is included in\ntaxable income during each year of the contract. 10\nBeginning in Taxable Year1, Taxpayer utilized a Foreign\nSales Corporation (\u201cFSC\u201d), a subsidiary incorporated in CountryZ,\nwith respect to its export sales for U.S. Federal income tax\npurposes, including sales from long-term contracts under both the\nFMS and DCS systems. Taxpayer's U.S. subsidiaries or business\nunits involved in the production of military equipment sold under\nFMS or DCS long-term contracts entered agreements with the FSC\nwhich provided that the FSC would arrange for sales to export\ncustomers. 11\nWhen the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion\nAct of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-519, 114 Stat. 2423 (Nov. 15, 2000)\n(hereinafter \u201cETI Act\") was enacted, Taxpayer sought to apply the\n10 Taxpayer has elected to apply the modified \"10-percent\" method under which\nno income is included until the first year in which 10 percent of the\nestimated total contract costs have been incurred. 11 An example of such an agreement is the ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. CC:LM:HMT:--------:POSTF-103313-03 page 13 ETI rules to income relating to certain long-term contracts which\nwere entered into prior to October 1, 2000 (the general effective\ndate of the 2000 Act). Under the FSC regime, only fifty percent\nof the foreign trading gross receipts (\u201cFTGR\u201d) attributable to\nthe sale of military property was eligible for the partial\nexemption from U.S. income tax provided by sections 923(a)(1) and\n921(a). I.R.C. \u00a7 923(a)(5). This provision, referred to as the\nmilitary property \u201chaircut\u201d, was not retained in the ETI\nexclusion provisions. Reporting its military property sales\nunder the ETI regime, consequently, doubles Taxpayer\u2019s tax\nbenefit in comparison with the benefit available under the FSC\nregime.

A parallel definition is included in the\nI.R.C. \u00a7 942 definition of FTGR as gross receipts from the sale,\nexchange, or other disposition, lease or rental and related or\nsubsidiary services of qualifying foreign trade property. I.R.C. \u00a7 942(a)(1). In other words, the ETI exclusion provisions apply to\ntransactions entered into on or after October 1, 2000. For\npurposes of this rule, \u201ctransaction\u201d and \u201ccontract\u201d are not\nsynonymous. See, e.g., ETI Act \u00a7 5(c)(1)(B) (distinguishing\nbetween transactions and contracts). A contract may give rise to\nmore than one transaction. And such transactions may be entered\ninto, for ETI exclusion and FSC purposes, at different times. As\nan example, consider Contract1 described above. The contract was\nsigned on Date1, and called for production and delivery of\nProductA. Pursuant to that same contract, the purchaser\nexercised an option, in Date2, for production and delivery of\nProductB. In this fact pattern, a contract made before the\neffective date of the ETI Act gave rise to two transactions, the\noriginal sale of ProductA and the second sale of ProductB. As we\nunderstand the facts of the case, the original sale was entered\ninto on the same date that the contract was made, Date1, and the\nsecond sale was entered into in Date2 when the option was\nexercised. The FSC 14 \u00a7 5(c) of the ETI Act provides for a transition period for existing FSCs. Initially, Taxpayer focused on the language of the transition provisions in\narguing it was entitled to report income under the ETI r\u00e9gime. However,\nTaxpayer has now recast it\u2019s argument to apply to all income generated\npursuant to pre-existing long-term contracts under the general effective date\nof the ETI Act. CC:LM:HMT:--------:POSTF-103313-03 page 16 provisions apply to the pre-ETI Act original transaction, and the\nETI exclusion provisions apply to the post-ETI Act second\ntransaction. In contrast, Taxpayer asserts it is entitled to report\nincome from military equipment sales after September 30, 2000\nunder the ETI regime rather than the FSC regime which,\nessentially, doubles it\u2019s tax benefit. Taxpayer insists it:\nmay apply the new ETI r\u00e9gime to taxable income\nreportable after September 30, -, regardless of whether\nthe income is attributable to a contract in effect\nprior to the enactment of ETI, and regardless of\nwhether income from previous years relating to the same\ncontract was reported under the FSC rules.

Consequently, Taxpayer\nargues that the sale transaction does not occur until it reports\nsale income under the I.R.C. \u00a7 460 percentage of completion\n(\u201cPOC\u201d) method of accounting. Under the POC method of\naccounting, Taxpayer includes in gross income, in each taxable\nyear ending after the date the contract is entered, a percentage\nof the total revenue it estimates it will receive from the\ncontract. The computation itself is based on all items under the\ncontract and is inconsistent with treating such items\nindependently. Without any cited authority or support, Taxpayer\nasserts that the use of the words \"gross receipts\" in\nI.R.C. \u00a7 460:\n\u2026 clearly indicates that the Service contemplates a\nsale or exchange at the time when gross receipts are\nreportable. In other words, under the POC method of\naccounting, the \"sale or exchange\" under Federal tax\nprinciples is really deemed to occur when the income is\nreported. (Taxpayer\u2019s Position Paper, p. 4.) Taxpayer\u2019s use of the POC method of accounting for\nlong-term contracts to define the scope of transactions\nencompassed within the ETI r\u00e9gime is untenable. A method of\naccounting addresses the recognition of income - it is\nirrelevant to determining the character of the income for\nCongress utilized the words \"transaction\" and \"contract\" in the same\nsentence arguing that this is proof that the terms can never equate. If\nuse in the same sentence was the touchstone for interpretation, a more\ncompelling conclusion is that income and transaction are never\nequivalents. See, I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 941 through 943.\n17 The award of the contract is generally the point at which disappointed\ncompetitors of the seller challenge the sale. See, e.g., Northrop Grumman\nCorp. v. U.S., 50 Fed. Cl. 443 (2001); Aero Corp. v. Department of the Navy,\n558 F.Supp. 404 (D.D.C. 1983). 18 See, e.g., LTR 82-12-043 (December 23, 1981).

In General Dynamics Corp. v.\nCommissioner, 108 T.C. 107 (1997), another taxpayer argued\nthat the use of a particular method of accounting could\naffect the amount of tax benefits the taxpayer could claim\nunder the precursor DISC provisions. In that case,\npetitioners used the completed contract method of accounting\nto report income and deductions from long-term contracts and\nsought to use that method to avoid the matching of costs\nwith income from export sales for purposes of computing\ncombined taxable income [\u201cCTI\u201d] under the DISC r\u00e9gime. The\nCourt pointed out that:\n\u2026The completed contract method is an accounting method\nthat allocates to a particular taxable year the items\nof income and expenses that must be reported within\nthat year. It is relevant only to the timing of\ndeductions and income recognition. \u2026 Like other\naccounting methods, the completed contract method\nrelies on other sections of the Code, such as the DISC\nprovisions, to determine the amount of income to be\nrecognized and the amount of allowable deductions.\n* * * * Allowing taxpayers to use their normal method of\naccounting to compute CTI does not necessarily cede to\nthe accounting methodology the computation of the\nlimitation of the benefit to be generated by foreign\nexports. The ETI r\u00e9gime determines what part of income from export\nsales are entitled to the beneficial treatment provided in\nthe ETI Act. The POC method of accounting is limited to\ncomputing the amount of that income required to be\nrecognized in a given year. The FSC regime, which Taxpayer acknowledges is\ninstructive in construing the ETI regime19, reinforces the\n19 The Joint Committee on Taxation, ETI Technical Explanation states: It is recognized that there may be a gap in time between the\nenactment of the Senate amendment and the issuance of detailed\nadministrative guidance.

Taxpayer, noting the application of FSC guidance to\nanalogous ETI concepts, analyzes the explicit provisions\nprovided when the FSC r\u00e9gime was enacted. Taxpayer focuses\non those provisions dealing with the availability of the FSC\nr\u00e9gime for taxpayers using the completed contract method of\nreporting income20 and argues that, by analogy, it should be\nable to use the POC method of accounting to define \u201csale\ntransaction\u201d. What Taxpayer ignores is that there is no\nanalogous provision for unique treatment of income\nrecognized under the POC method of accounting for long-term\ncontracts in the ETI Act. Had Congress intended that\nresult, it arguably would have included explicit provisions\nas it did when the FSC regime was enacted. The ETI Act itself demonstrates the inapplicability of the\nPOC method of accounting in defining a \u201ctransaction\u201d. The ETI\nAct, and I.R.C. \u00a7 114, provides that extraterritorial income is\nexcluded from gross income. However, to constitute\nextraterritorial income and qualify for exclusion, the income\nmust be qualifying foreign trade income as defined in I.R.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 941 through 943.

CC:LM:HMT:--------:POSTF-103313-03 page 21 Again, the FSC regulations provide guidance on the\ndefinition of \u201ctransaction\u201d. Treas. Reg.\u00a7 1.924(a)-1T(b)\naddressing \u201cSales of export property\u201d provides:\nForeign trading gross receipts of a FSC include gross\nreceipts from the sale of export property by the FSC,\nor by any principal for whom the FSC acts as a\ncommission agent \u2026, pursuant to a contract entered into\nwith a purchaser by the FSC or by the principal at any\ntime\u2026 Any agreement, oral or written, which constitutes\na contract at law, satisfies the contractual\nrequirements of this paragraph. The term \"transaction\" is used extensively in I.R.C.\n\u00a7 942, enacted as part of the ETI Act, which defines FTGRs. A taxpayer is treated as having FTGR from a transaction only\nif economic processes with respect to such transaction take\nplace outside the United States. I.R.C. \u00a7 942(b)(1). That\neconomic processes are required in relationship to each\ntransaction to qualify for ETI treatment highlights the flaw\nin Taxpayer\u2019s argument. The economic processes requirement applies to all of\nthe varieties of transactions the ETI regime encompasses,\ne.g., sales, exchanges, leases and the provision of\nservices. The identified foreign economic processes which\nmust be performed with respect to a transaction include:\nadvertising and sales promotion; processing of customer\norders and arranging for delivery; transportation outside\nthe United States in connection with delivery to the\ncustomer; the determination and transmittal of a final\ninvoice or statement of account or the receipt of payment;\nand, the assumption of credit risk.

Further,\nif transaction is equated with income recognized under the\nPOC method of accounting, FTGR and foreign economic\nprocesses are irrelevant. More significantly, if a\n\"transaction\" is deemed synonymous with income recognition\nunder Taxpayer's method of accounting, that \"transaction\"\narguably could not generate FTGR entitled to the benefits of\nthe ETI regime. and economic process test such expenses (and the expenses of the US\nGovernment in connection with the sale) will not be taken into account.\u201d General explanation of the Revenue Provisions of the Deficit Reduction\nAct of 1984, III.
