ISSUE\nWhether Taxpayer had actual or constructive receipt of the proceeds from the sale of\nrelinquished property that, as a result, disqualifies Taxpayer from deferred taxation\nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 1031? CONCLUSION Yes. As explained herein, Taxpayer had actual and/or constructive receipt of the\nproceeds from the sale of relinquished property. Therefore, Taxpayer may not defer\ntaxation under section 1031 pursuant to the like-kind exchange program, described\nbelow. STATEMENT OF FACTS Taxpayer is a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for tax purposes. Taxpayer is subject to the unified audit procedures in sections 6621-6234 (i.e., TEFRA\nprocedures). Taxpayer is owned by: ------------------ (--------%), ------------------ (--------%),\nand -------------------------------------- (--%). -------------------------------------- is owned by ------------------------ (---%) and ------------------ (---%). The ownership structure is in the\nfollowing schematic. POSTF-125831-12 5 Taxpayer purchases cars that it leases to --------------------------------------, a car rental\ncompany. 1 Taxpayer and -------------------------------------- are two of several entities\nowned by ------------------ and ------------------ as part of their ------------------------- franchise\nenterprise. Taxpayer was established to facilitate a low-cost fleet financing agreement. Taxpayer entered into an exchange agreement with ----------------------------------------------(\u201c-------------\u201d) whereby ------------- would act as a qualified intermediary (\u201cQI\u201d) facilitating\na like-kind exchange program (\u201cLKE Program\u201d). 2 --------------was later succeeded by -------------------, which was the QI during the year under examination. Taxpayer sold almost all of its vehicles (relinquished property) in wholesale automobile\nauctions, either to automobile manufacturers or automobile dealers. 3 Taxpayer sold the\nremainder through wholesale automobile brokers. 4 The proceeds from sale of the\nrelinquished property moved through three accounts. (1) Exchange Funds Collection Account (QI collection account). Taxpayer assigned its\nrights under the sales contracts to the QI.5 The proceeds were deposited to the QI\u2019s\ncollection account, called the Exchange Funds Collection Account, which is a restricted\naccount maintained by the QI.6 The Exchange Funds Collection Account is defined as\n\u201ca single, segregated \u2018lockbox\u2019 collection account with Intermediary for all Participant\nExchangors, governed by the terms of this Agreement [the Amended Master Exchange\nAgreement] and into which proceeds from the sale of Relinquished Property are\ndeposited.\u201d7 Regarding restrictions, the Amended Master Exchange Agreement states:8\n1 Amended Master Exchange Agreement, dated -----------------, by ---------------------------------------------, Taxpayer, --------------------------------, ------------------------------------, --------------------------------, and -------------------------------- (herein \u201cAmended Master Exchange Agreement\u201d) at recital B.\n2\nAmended Master Exchange Agreement. 3\nResponse to IDR 8, LKE Funds Flow. 4\nResponse to IDR 8, LKE Funds Flow. 5\nAmended Master Exchange Agreement at \u00a7 3.1.\n6\nResponse to IDR 8, LKE Funds Flow; Amended Master Exchange Agreement, Art. 1.5.\n7\nAmended Master Exchange Agreement at \u00a7 1.5.

(2) Master Collateral Account (Qualified Escrow Account). 9 The proceeds in the QI\u2019s\ncollection account were transferred, by an automatic, nightly sweep, to a Master\nCollateral Account at ------------------------------ (\u201cBank\u201d), which is an account that receives\nand hold funds for the benefit of a consortium of lenders10 that has liens on all rights to\nthe automobiles, including those owned by Taxpayer. 11 The rules in the Master\nCollateral Agency and Security Agreement govern the Master Collateral Account. 8 Amended Master Exchange Agreement at \u00a7 4.1(c).

You propose to\ndisallow this deferred gain because Taxpayer\u2019s LKE Program did not meet the\nrequirements of section 1031. LAW AND ANALYSIS Generally, no gain or loss is recognized on the exchange of property held for productive\nuse in a trade or business (\u201crelinquished property\u201d) if the property is exchanged solely\nfor property of like-kind that is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business\nor for investment (\u201creplacement property\u201d). 19 In order to qualify for nonrecognition\ntreatment of the gain or loss on the exchange, the replacement property must be\nidentified as property to be received in the exchange on or before 45 days after the date\non which the taxpayer transfers the relinquished property and the property must be\nreceived after the earlier of 180 days after the date on which the taxpayer transfers the\nrelinquished property, or the due date for the transferor's federal income tax return for\nthe year in which the transfer of the relinquished property occurs. 20 An exchange may still qualify for like-kind treatment if the replacement property is\nreceived after the relinquished property has been transferred, provided that the\nrequirements of Treas. Reg. section 1.1031(k)-1 are met.21 This exchange is called a\ndeferred exchange and is pursuant to an agreement to exchange property. 22 The\ndeferred exchange must actually be an exchange, not a sale of property followed by a\npurchase of property of a like kind. 23 The exchange will also not qualify for favorable\ntreatment under section 1031 if the taxpayer actually or constructively receives money\nor property that does not meet the requirements of section 1031, in the full amount of\nthe consideration for the relinquished property before the replacement property is\nreceived. 24\n19 I.R.C. \u00a7 1031(a)(1).

It appears that Taxpayer is engaged in ongoing exchanges of tangible\npersonal property using a single intermediary, but Taxpayer does not claim that its\ntransactions satisfy Revenue Procedure 2003-39. Generally, like-kind programs that do\nnot meet the safe harbor rules of Revenue Procedure 2003-39 may qualify for\nnonrecognition treatment if they otherwise meet the requirements of section 1031 and\nthe regulations thereunder. Regarding receipt of money or other property, section 1.1031(k)-1(f)(1), states:\nin the case of a transfer of relinquished property in a deferred exchange,\ngain or loss may be recognized if the taxpayer actually or constructively\nreceives money or other property before the taxpayer actually receives\nlike-kind replacement property. If the taxpayer actually or constructively\nreceives money or other property in the full amount of the consideration\nfor the relinquished property before the taxpayer actually receives like-kind\nreplacement property, the transaction will constitute a sale and not a\ndeferred exchange, even though the taxpayer may ultimately receive the\nlike-kind replacement property.",

The Regulation further describes when a taxpayer would be in constructive receipt of\nmoney. Specifically, section 1.1031(k)-1(f)(2) provides:\n(2) Actual and constructive receipt. Except as provided in paragraph\n(g) of this section (relating to safe harbors), for purposes of section 1031\nand this section, the determination of whether (or the extent to which) the\ntaxpayer is in actual or constructive receipt of money or other property\nbefore the taxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property is\nmade under the general rules concerning actual and constructive receipt\nand without regard to the taxpayer\u2019s method of accounting. The taxpayer\nis in actual receipt of money or property at the time the taxpayer actually\nreceives the money or property or receives the economic benefit of the\nmoney or property. The taxpayer is in constructive receipt of money or\nproperty at the time the money or property is credited to the taxpayer\u2019s\naccount, set apart for the taxpayer, or otherwise made available so that\nthe taxpayer may draw upon it at any time or so that the taxpayer can\ndraw upon it if notice of intention to draw is given. Although the taxpayer\nis not in constructive receipt of money or property if the taxpayer\u2019s control\nof its receipt is subject to substantial limitations or restrictions, the\ntaxpayer is in constructive receipt of the money or property at the time the\nlimitations or restrictions lapse, expire, or are waived\u2026. The safe harbors in section 1.1031(k)-1(g) prevent actual or constructive receipt by a POSTF-125831-12 11 taxpayer of money or other property. The safe harbors include use of escrow accounts\nand qualified intermediaries. A \u201cqualified escrow account\u201d is an escrow account wherein the escrow holder is not the\ntaxpayer (or a disqualified person) and the escrow agreement expressly limits the\ntaxpayer\u2019s rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise obtain the benefits of the cash\nor cash equivalent held in the escrow account. 25 A \u201cdisqualified person\u201d includes a\nperson owning more than 10% of the capital interest or profits interest in a partnership,\nas stated in section 707(b)(1)(A).26 This safe harbor ceases to apply when the taxpayer\nhas an immediate ability or unrestricted right to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise\nobtain the benefits of the cash or cash equivalent held in the qualified escrow account\nor qualified trust. 27\nA \u201cqualified intermediary\u201d is a person who is not the taxpayer (or a disqualified person)\nand enters into a written agreement with the taxpayer (the \u201cexchange agreement\u201d) and,\nas required by the exchange agreement, acquires the relinquished property from the\ntaxpayer, transfers the relinquished property, acquires the replacement property, and\ntransfers the replacement property to the taxpayer. 28",

First, Taxpayer can direct payments representing liquidation\nproceeds of vehicles in the LKE Program.35 This control by Taxpayer reflects\nTaxpayer\u2019s actual or constructive receipt of the funds, which precludes deferred taxtreatment under section 1031.36 Second, the qualified intermediary has no rights over the Repayment Account and\ncannot authorize transfers from the account nor effectively limit Taxpayer\u2019s rights to\nreceive, pledge, borrow or otherwise obtain the benefits from the proceeds held in this\naccount, as required by section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(6). Through the series of transfers of the\nfunds from the sale of relinquished properties, the limitation in the Amended Master\nExchange Agreement became ineffective. Similarly, the Repayment Account is not a qualified escrow account under section\n1.1031(k)-1(g)(3)(ii) because the account does not limit Taxpayer\u2019s ability to use the\nfunds in the account. Further, --------------- is a signatory and escrow holder, but he also\nowns --------% of Taxpayer. As a result, he owns more than 10% of Taxpayer, a\npartnership, and is therefore a disqualified person. 37 An escrow account is not a\nqualified escrow account if held by a disqualified person. 38\nTaxpayer received proceeds in the Repayment Account when the proceeds were\ndeposited into the account. This is apparent by Taxpayer\u2019s actual use of the funds in ------------------------ to acquire vehicles outside of the LKE program. Under section\n1.1031(k)-1(a), Taxpayer engaged in a sale, followed by a purchase of property of likekind, not a deferred exchange.",

Under section\n1.1031(k)-1(a), Taxpayer engaged in a sale, followed by a purchase of property of likekind, not a deferred exchange. Taxpayer\u2019s unrestricted right to the funds in the\nRepayment Account excludes Taxpayer from the deferral of the gain from the exchange\nof like-kind properties allowed under section 1031 and, consequently, the gains from the\nexchanges must be currently recognized. Taxpayer\u2019s position is that the Repayment Account is essentially an escrow account. As stated previously, however, to be an escrow account, the account holder must not be\nthe taxpayer and the escrow agreement must expressly limit the taxpayer\u2019s ability to\nobtain the cash in the escrow account. Once a taxpayer obtains the rights to the cash,\nthen the escrow account safe harbor ceases to apply. In the present case, officers of\nan entity related to Taxpayer control the account and the agreements governing the\nLKE Program do not expressly limit Taxpayer\u2019s ability to obtain the cash in the\nRepayment Account.
