Issue Are the proceeds received by --------------- in ------ and ------ for the temporary taking of two\nproperties attributable to an involuntary conversion described in I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a)? Conclusion\nNo. The proceeds constitute compensation for the temporary taking of the properties and,\nconsequently, result in rental income under I.R.C. \u00a7 61(a)(5). Thus, the proceeds are taxable as\nordinary income to --------------- in the year of receipt. Facts ---------------------------is the owner of -------- acres of land in the ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------. The property includes 2 tracts: --------acres referred to as the \"--------------------\u201d and ------acres referred to as the \"---------------------------.\" ------ acquired the ---------------------------in ------. It then constructed an office building containing -----------square feet for the purpose of leasing it to the ---------------------------. This lease began\non --------------------and ended on -------------------------. ------ acquired the tracts that make up the ----------------between ------- and -------. On ---------------------, it entered into a ----year lease with the ------------------------------------------------------- for the\nbenefit of the ----------------------------------------------. After ------ entered into this lease with ------, -----------------------------instituted condemnation proceedings to take the ----------------for its use. Due to these proceedings, ------ was unable to lease the ---------------to the ------. 2 The taking was annually renewed until a Stipulation for Settlement was reached, and the\nStipulation was then approved in a Final Judgment dated ----------------------. The final judgment\nprovided for $----------------of compensation payable for the taking of the leasehold from ------------------through -------------------------.1 ------ initially treated the proceeds as ordinary income. They later filed amended returns for -------------------------. On the amended return, -------deducted $--------------of the basis of the ------------------ in determining the gain on the $----------------proceeds and reported the difference as longterm capital gain. -------reported the proceeds in a consistent manner on its ---------------tax\nreturns. The Service did not examine ------\u2019s ---------------tax returns. ----------------------------was not prepared to vacate the ---------------------------or the -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------in --------------------. Consequently, it instituted new proceedings to take the ---------------------------and the ---------------------for a period of --- months. -----------------------------prepared an appraisal of the ---------------------------dated -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, for -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- in\nconnection with the proceedings. The appraiser concluded that the present value of the taking\nfor a three-year period was $--------------based upon the fair rental value of the property. -------------------------------------, also prepared an appraisal of the ----------------in connection with the\nproceeding, and concluded that the present value of the taking for a three-year period was $-------------------based upon the fair rental value of the property. These proceedings resulted in a Stipulated Judgment being entered on -------------------, granting\n----------------------------the use of both parcels for the ----month period from -------------------------------------------------------------, with an option to extend the taking through -------------------------. The\nStipulated Judgment provides for $----------------of compensation, payable for the taking of the\nproperty rights identified in the complaint and declaration of taking \u201ctogether with all\nimprovements thereon and appurtenances thereunto belonging.\u201d2 In addition, the Stipulated\nJudgment also provided that just compensation for any occupancy for the period -------------------------- through --------------------------would be $-----------per month.",

Law & Analysis\nI.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a)(1) provides that if property is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into\nproperty \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d through an exchange, no gain is recognized. However, if the property is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into money or property not\nsimilar or related in service or use, gain is recognized only to the extent provided in\n\u00a7 1033(a)(2)(A) if the taxpayer elects \u00a7 1033 treatment within the prescribed period, and\nacquires property \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d to the converted property. I.R.C. \u00a7\n1033(a)(2)(A).",

      "content": "I.R.C. \u00a7\n1033(a)(2)(A). The period of replacement is \u201cthe period beginning with the date of the\ndisposition of the converted property, or the earliest date of the threat or imminence of\nrequisition or condemnation of the converted property, whichever is earlier, and ending 2 years\nafter the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain upon of the conversion is\nrealized\u201d or at the close of such a later date by application from the taxpayer. I.R.C. \u00a7\n1033(a)(2)(B). In the case of real property held for productive use in trade or business or for\ninvestment, the replacement period is three years after the close for the first taxable year in\nwhich any part of the gain is realized. I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(g)(1), (4). This case involves a compelled lease of property for a period of --- months. ------ filed an\namended return to claim I.R.C. \u00a7 1033 nonrecognition treatment for the taking proceeds and\nrequested an extension of the period to acquire replacement property. Since the property\ninvolved in the compelled lease was held for use by -------as rental property, the three year\nperiod to acquire replacement property applies if the compelled lease is an involuntary 4\nconversion to which \u00a7 1033 applies. In that case, if ------ first realized gain in -------, the three\nyear replacement period expires on ---------------------------, unless extended. The question at\nissue is whether \u00a7 1033 applies to a temporary taking of property. The IRS addressed the tax effect of a temporary taking in Rev. Rul. 38, 1953-1 C.B. 16. In Rev.\nRul. 38, the United States Government requisitioned the use of a warehouse for a five-year\nperiod. The Service concluded that the condemnation proceeds were ordinary income because\nthe payments for the temporary use of the building were in the nature of rent. The Service\nnoted that the taxpayer had neither disposed of the property nor realized gain from its\ninvoluntary conversion. Similarly, in the present case, ----------------------------took ------\u2019s real\nproperty for a period of --- months. ------ did not dispose of the property or realize gain from its\ninvoluntary conversion. It follows that the taking proceeds ------ received for the ----month period\nconstitute ordinary income. There is additional support for the Service\u2019s position that the temporary taking of property is not\nan involuntary conversion. In Commissioner v. Gillette Motor Transport, Inc., 364 U.S. 130\n(1960), the United States Government temporarily took over the taxpayer\u2019s trucking business for\na period of 10 months during World War II when the taxpayer\u2019s drivers went on strike. The\nSupreme Court upheld the Service's position that compensation paid to the taxpayer for the\ntemporary taking of its trucking business was ordinary income. The Court rejected the\ntaxpayer\u2019s argument that taking proceeds constituted capital gain. The Court found that the\nGovernment took only the right to use the facilities and not a fee simple interest. The Court\nstated that compensation for the right to use property was \u201ccommonly regarded as rent.\u201d Gillette, 364 U.S. at 135. In the present case, ----------------------------took the right to the use of ------\u2019s real property for a\nperiod of ----months. ----------------------------compensated",

      "content": "The Court\nstated that compensation for the right to use property was \u201ccommonly regarded as rent.\u201d Gillette, 364 U.S. at 135. In the present case, ----------------------------took the right to the use of ------\u2019s real property for a\nperiod of ----months. ----------------------------compensated ------ for the right to use the property,\nnot for a fee interest in property. Therefore, it follows that these payments received by -----were in the nature of rent. -------contends that Rev. Rul. 83-70, 1983-1 C.B. 189, is authority for its position that the\nproceeds it received were received in connection with an involuntary conversion. In Rev. Rul.\n83-70, the Service ruled that a fee interest in real property acquired by a taxpayer with\ncondemnation proceeds constituted \u201cproperty similar or related in service or use\u201d to a 15-year\nleasehold interest that had been involuntarily converted. The taxpayer had leased property that\nit used in its furniture storage business with a 15-year term remaining on the lease at the time of\nthe taking. The taxpayer had no options to renew the lease. The taxpayer acquired a fee\nsimple interest in property to use in its business and was allowed nonrecognition treatment. Rev, Rul. 83-70 is distinguishable from the present case. In Rev. Rul. 83-70, the taxpayer\u2019s\nentire interest (its 15-year leasehold interest) was taken. Thus, the taking constituted a final\ndisposition of the taxpayer\u2019s property. The taking was not a lease or sublease of the property. In contrast, in the taking at issue in the present case, ----------------------------took the ----------------------------and the ----------------for only ----months and -------retained a continuing fee interest in\nboth properties. The taking did not affect ------\u2019s right to develop the properties after the\nexpiration of the ----month taking period or to realize capital appreciation on the properties both\nduring and after the ----month period. Therefore, ----------------------------- temporary taking of the\n----------------------------and the ----------------does not qualify as an involuntary conversion\ndescribed in I.R.C. \u00a7 1033(a). The proceeds allocable to the properties are in the nature of rent 5\nthat is taxable as ordinary income and includable in income in the year of receipt.
