The highlighted text was added to INTRODUCTION:\nThe Bureau of Prisons shall designate the place of the prisoner's imprisonment, and shall, subject\nto bed availability, the prisoner's security designation, the prisoner's programmatic needs, the\nprisoner's mental and medical health needs, any request made by the prisoner related to faithbased needs, recommendations of the sentencing court, and other security concerns of the Bureau\nof Prisons, place the prisoner in a facility as close as practicable to the prisoner's primary\nresidence, and to the extent practicable, in a facility within 500 driving miles of that residence. The highlighted text was added and the deleted text is struck through in Chapter 5,\nMANAGEMENT VARIABLES AND PUBLIC SAFETY FACTORS:\nD Release Residence. The Bureau of Prisons attempts to place each inmate in an\ninstitution that is reasonably close to the anticipated release area. Ordinarily,\nplacement within 500 miles of the release area is to be considered reasonable,\nregardless of whether there may be an institution closer to the inmate\u2019s release\narea. To the extent practicable, placement to the closest facility within 500\ndriving miles of the release area will be considered reasonable, subject to bed\navailability, the prisoner\u2019s security designation, the prisoner\u2019s programmatic\nneeds, the prisoner\u2019s mental and medical health needs, any request made by the prisoner related to faith-based needs, recommendations of the sentencing court,\nand other security concerns of the Bureau of Prisons. This MGTV may also apply\nto inmates who are within 36 months of release. E Following are example situations: facility activation; population pressures\naffecting available appropriate-level bed space within 500 driving miles of the\ninmate\u2019s anticipated release residence; gang/security concerns. Additionally highlighted text was added and the deleted text is struck through in Chapter 7,\nInstitution Classification Transfers. 2. NEARER RELEASE TRANSFERS (Code 313). Once the inmate has been transferred\nwithin 500 driving miles of his or her release residence, no further referrals will be made for\nnearer release transfer consideration. further referrals can be considered for nearer release\ntransfer consideration subject to bed availability, the prisoner\u2019s security designation, the\nprisoner\u2019s programmatic needs, the prisoner\u2019s mental and medical health needs, any request\nmade by the prisoner related to faith-based needs, recommendations of the sentencing court,\nand other security concerns of the Bureau of Prisons.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE. This Program Statement provides policy\nand procedure regarding the Bureau of Prisons inmate\nclassification system. The classification of inmates is\nnecessary to place each inmate in the most appropriate\nsecurity level institution that also meets their program\nneeds and is consistent with the Bureau\u2019s mission to protect\nsociety. The Bureau\u2019s classification, designation and\nredesignation procedures are consistent with the\nstatutory authority contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b). All\nclassification, designation and redesignation decisions\nare made without favoritism given to an inmate\u2019s social\nor economic status. 2. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. Statement are:",

P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 1, Page 1\nINTRODUCTION Bureau of Prisons (BOP) institutions are classified into\none of five security levels: MINIMUM, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and\nADMINISTRATIVE based on the level of security and staff\nsupervision the institution is able to provide. An institution\u2019s level of security and staff supervision\nis based on the following factors:\n!\n!\n!\n! mobile patrol;\ntowers;\nperimeter barriers;\ndetection devices; !\n!\n!\n! internal security;\ntype of inmate housing;\ninmate-to-staff ratio; and,\nany special institutional mission. Similarly, BOP inmates are classified based on\nthe following factors:\n\u2022 The level of security and supervision the inmate\nrequires; and, \u2022 The inmate\u2019s program needs, i.e., substance abuse,\neducational/vocational training, individual\ncounseling, group counseling, or medical/mental\nhealth treatment, etc. In summary, the initial assignment (designation) of an inmate\nto a particular institution is based primarily upon:\n\u2022 The level of security and supervision the inmate\nrequires; \u2022 The level of security and staff supervision the\ninstitution is able to provide; and, \u2022 The inmate\u2019s program needs. Additional factors that are also considered when designating\nan inmate to a particular institution include, but are not\nlimited to:\n\u2022 The inmate\u2019s release residence; \u2022 The level of overcrowding at an institution; \u2022 Any security, location or program recommendation made\nby the sentencing court;",

Initial designations to BOP institutions are initiated, in\nmost cases by staff at the Designation and Sentence\nComputation Center (DSCC), Grand Prairie, Texas, who assess\nand enter information from the sentencing court, U.S. Marshals\nService,\nU.S. Attorneys Office or other prosecuting authority and the\nU.S. Probation Office about the inmate into a computer database\n(SENTRY). The Bureau of Prisons shall designate the place of the\nprisoner's imprisonment, and shall, subject to bed\navailability, the prisoner's security designation, the\nprisoner's programmatic needs, the prisoner's mental and\nmedical health needs, any request made by the prisoner related\nto faith-based needs, recommendations of the sentencing court,\nand other security concerns of the Bureau of Prisons, place\nthe prisoner in a facility as close as practicable to the\nprisoner's primary residence, and to the extent practicable,\nin a facility within 500 driving miles of that residence. SENTRY then calculates a point score for that inmate which\n(for example, 18 points) is then matched with a commensurate\nsecurity level institution. Security\nLevel Custody\nLevel Male Female MINIMUM COMMUNITY and\nOUT 0-11 points 0-15 points LOW OUT and IN 12-15 points 16-30 points MEDIUM OUT and IN 16-23 points * HIGH IN and MAXIMUM 24+ points 31+ points ADMINISTRATIVE All custody\nlevels All point\ntotals All\npoint P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 1, Page 3 An inmate\u2019s security point score is not the only factor used\nin determining a commensurate security level for an inmate. The\napplication of a PSF or MGTV could effect placement at either\na higher or lower level institution than the specified point\ntotal indicates. (SEE CHAPTER 5 FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION)\nNOTE: A security level cannot be assigned by SENTRY without\ncompleting an Inmate Load and Security Designation\nForm. If an inmate has not been assigned a security\nlevel, SENTRY will automatically assign \u201cUNKNOWN\u201d as\nthe security level. * Female security level institutions are classified\nas Minimum, Low, High and Administrative. Once all necessary information has been entered into the\nSENTRY database, a DSCC or Medical Designations Officer,\n(hereafter, Designator) selects an institution for service of\nsentence based on all the previously mentioned factors. Redesignations (transfers) from one Bureau institution to\nanother are considered in much the same manner using many of\nthe same factors used at the time of initial designation. In\naddition, the inmate\u2019s institutional adjustment and program\nperformance are also carefully reviewed when redesignation is\nconsidered. Finally, an initial custody level (COMMUNITY, IN, OUT, MAXIMUM)\nis also assigned to the inmate that is consistent with the\ninstitutions mission. (See previous chart). An inmate\u2019s custody\nlevel within any given security level institution is routinely\nreviewed and may change for various reasons during the period\nof incarceration.

P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 2, Page 1\nDEFINITIONS ADMINISTRATIVE INSTITUTION. An institution with a special\nmission, where inmates are assigned based on factors other than\nsecurity and/or staff supervision (for example, medical/mental\nhealth, pretrial and holdover). Administrative institutions are\ndesigned to house all security level inmates. CENTRAL INMATE MONITORING (CIM). The Bureau monitors and\ncontrols the transfer, temporary release, and community\nactivities of certain inmates who present special needs for\nmanagement. Such inmates, known as Central Inmate Monitoring\ncases, require a higher level of review prior to any\nmovement outside the institution. CLASSIFICATION. The systematic subdivision of inmates into\ngroups based on their security and program needs. COMMUNITY CUSTODY. The lowest custody level assigned to an\ninmate which affords the lowest level of security and staff\nsupervision. An inmate who has COMMUNITY custody may be eligible\nfor the least secure housing, including any which is outside the\ninstitution's perimeter, may work on outside details with\nminimal supervision, and may participate in community-based\nprogram activities if other eligibility requirements are\nsatisfied. CONTRACT FACILITY. A state or local prison, institution,\nfacility, jail, or other non-federal enterprise that\ncontracts with the Bureau to house federal inmates (i.e.,\nCommunity Corrections Center). Contract facilities are\ncontracted and supervised by the CCMs. CRIMINAL HISTORY POINTS. Criminal History Points are used to\ncalculate the Bureau\u2019s Criminal History Score. The Criminal\nHistory Points is the calculation, as specified by the U.S.\nSentencing Commission Guidelines (Guidelines Manual, Chapter 4),\nwhich assigns a numerical value based on the individuals entire\ncriminal record of convictions. Ordinarily, the Criminal History\nPoints are calculated by the United States Probation Office. CRIMINAL HISTORY SCORE (CHS). The CHS is one of the factors used\nto calculate the inmate\u2019s security point total. The CHS is\nderived from the Criminal History Points whereby the Criminal\nHistory Points fall into one of six categories. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 2, Page 2\nCURRENT OFFENSE. For classification purposes, the current\noffense is the most severe documented instant offense\nbehavior regardless of the conviction offense. CUSTODY CLASSIFICATION. The review process to assign a custody\nlevel based on an inmate\u2019s criminal history, instant offense,\nand institutional adjustment. A custody level (i.e., COMMUNITY,\nOUT, IN, and MAXIMUM) dictates the degree of staff supervision\nrequired for an individual inmate. DESIGNATION. An order from the DSCC indicating the initial\nfacility of confinement for an inmate. DESIGNATION FACILITY (DFCL). Each of the separate missions\nwithin an institution for designation purposes. Each DFCL is\nshown as a separate line on the Population Report and has\nits own security level and destination (DST) assignment. Designations are made to a DFCL\ncode rather than to a facility (FACL) code. JUDGMENT. The official court document (e.g., Judgment and\nCommitment Order or Judgment in a Criminal Case) which is signed\nby the Judge. The Judgment contains the offense(s) for which the\ncourt imposes its sentence, which ordinarily includes a\nfinancial, confinement and supervision obligation. HISTORY.",

The inmate's entire background of criminal convictions\n(excluding the current offense) and institutional disciplinary\nfindings used to assess points related to his/her history of\nviolence and/or history of escape. IN CUSTODY. The second highest custody level assigned to an\ninmate which requires the second highest level of security and\nstaff supervision. An inmate who has IN custody is assigned to\nregular quarters and is eligible for all regular work\nassignments and activities under a normal level of\nsupervision. Inmates with IN custody are not eligible for work\ndetails or programs outside the institution's secure perimeter. LEGAL RESIDENCE. The inmate\u2019s local and state address as\nreported by the United States Probation Office at the\ntime of conviction. LONG-TERM DETAINEE. A non-U.S. citizen (alien) who has: \u2022 finished serving a local, state, or federal sentence; \u2022 completed immigration proceedings that have resulted\nin an order of deportation, exclusion, or other\nmeans of P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 2, Page 3\nremoval by either the Executive Office for\nImmigration Review (EOIR), or the Bureau of\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), formerly\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS);\nand,\n\u2022 cannot be removed from the country for various reasons. MANAGEMENT SECURITY LEVEL (MSL). Management Security Level is\nthe security level assigned by the DSCC Administrator or\ndesignee to an inmate upon application of any of the\nfollowing Management Variables:\n\u2022 PSF Waived; \u2022 Greater Security; and, \u2022 Lesser Security. Based on these Management Variables, the Management\nSecurity Level will normally be one security level greater\nor lesser than the scored security level. MANAGEMENT VARIABLE. A Management Variable (MGTVs) reflects and\nsupports the professional judgment of Bureau staff to ensure\nthe inmate\u2019s placement in the most appropriate level\ninstitution. A Management Variable(s) is required when\nplacement has been made and/or maintained at an institution\nlevel inconsistent with the inmate\u2019s security score \u2014 a score\nwhich may not completely/ accurately reflect his or her\nsecurity needs. MAXIMUM CUSTODY. The highest custody level assigned to an inmate\nrequiring the highest level of security and staff supervision. An inmate with MAXIMUM custody requires ultimate control and\nsupervision. This classification is for individuals who, by\ntheir behavior, have been identified as assaultive, predacious,\nriotous, serious escape risks, or seriously disruptive to the\norderly running of an institution. Accordingly, quarters and\nwork assignments are assigned to ensure maximum control and\nsupervision. A custody change to or from MAXIMUM custody must be\njustified thoroughly on the BP-338 form and maintained\npermanently in the Inmate Central File. MISDEMEANANT. An inmate convicted of an offense for which the\nmaximum penalty is one year or less. Such inmates may not be\ntransferred to a High security institution without first\nsigning a waiver. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4083 prohibits\nplacement of such inmates in \"penitentiaries\" without their\nconsent; however, the Bureau broadens that prohibition to\ninclude any High security institution. A sample of the waiver\nis provided in Appendix B. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 2, Page 4\nOUT CUSTODY.

Violators are inmates who were released from Bureau custody to\nthe supervision of a D.C. or U.S. Probation Officer (USPO) and\nhave violated the conditions of their release. These violators\nare returned to Bureau custody and are required to have a\nparole hearing within certain time limits. The purpose of\nthis is to provide the inmate with an in-person hearing before\nthe U.S. Parole Commission (USPC) to determine if the inmate\nhas violated the conditions of parole, mandatory release, or\nspecial parole. Therefore it is necessary to temporarily place\nthese individuals at parolable institutions in order to\nconduct parole hearings. PRIVATIZED FACILITY. A prison, institution, or other\ncorrectional facility that is operated or supervised by a\nnon- governmental entity. Privatized facilities are\nmanaged by private organizations or individuals with\noversight provided by Bureau staff. PUBLIC SAFETY FACTOR. There are certain demonstrated behaviors\nwhich require increased security measures to ensure the\nprotection of society. There are nine Public Safety Factors\n(PSFs) which are applied to inmates who are not appropriate for\nplacement at an institution which would permit inmate access to\nthe community (i.e., MINIMUM security). The application of a PSF\noverrides security point scores to ensure the appropriate\nsecurity level is assigned to an inmate, based on his or her\ndemonstrated current or prior behavior. REDESIGNATION. The reassignment of an inmate from one\ninstitution to another after initial designation. Unit staff\nsubmit a request to the DSCC, and the inmate\u2019s case is reviewed\nfor possible transfer. Approval of a redesignation results in an\norder from DSCC staff indicating a correctional institution to\nwhich an inmate is to be transferred. The actual movement of an\ninmate from one institution or facility to another is referred\nto as a transfer. RELEASE RESIDENCE. The verifiable destination to which an inmate\nrealistically plans to reside upon release from Bureau custody. The inmate must provide proof of residence to his or her unit\nstaff. Staff will rely upon the following references to assist\nin verification: Presentence Investigation Report/USPO P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 2, Page 5\nverification; telephone and visiting lists; and, incoming and\noutgoing mail. SECONDARY DESIGNATION. The second part of a two part\ndesignation, usually after a temporary designation to\nreceive medical/mental health treatment or to participate in\na specific institutional program or parole hearing. SECURITY LEVEL. Used to describe the structural variables and\ninmate-to-staff ratio provided at the various types of Bureau\ninstitutions (i.e., Minimum, Low, Medium, High). It also\nidentifies the institution type required to house inmates\nbased on their histories, institutional adjustment, and Public\nSafety Factors as well as the physical security of the\ninstitution to include mobile patrols, gun towers, perimeter\nbarriers, housing, detection devices, inmate-to-staff ratio,\nand internal security.

STATEMENT OF REASONS. The Statement of Reasons (SOR) is an\nattachment to the criminal judgment (Judgment and Commitment\nOrder; Judgment in a Criminal Case) which indicates the reason\nfor the court\u2019s final sentence, and other sentencing related\nissues (e.g., resolution of disputed issues, changes in\nscoring, statements of court intent, etc.). It is required in\nevery felony case where the sentencing range exceeds 24 months,\nor whenever there is a departure from the U.S. Sentencing\nGuidelines range. The court may complete an SOR even if not\nrequired. STUDY CASE. A study case is an inmate who is committed for a\nperiod of study and observation pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n3552(b) or (c)), 4241(b) or (d), 4242(a), 4243(a) or (b),\n4244(b),\n4245(b), 4246(b), or 4247(b) or (c)). An inmate committed for a\nstudy and observation will be referred to the Central Office\nMedical Designator in the Office of Medical Designations and\nTransportation (OMDT) for designation to a facility that can\ncomplete the study, considering any specific medical or\npsychiatric issues which should be addressed. The Central Office\nMedical Designator should attempt to place the inmate in the\nmost suitable facility compatible with the offender's security\nand custody needs, closest to the court and available resources. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 3, Page 1\nSECURITY DESIGNATION PROCEDURES FOR NEW COMMITMENTS The Designation and Sentence Computation Center will\nordinarily complete the initial designation within three\nworking days of receiving all the necessary documentation from\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) and the U.S. Probation\nOfficer (USPO) which includes the following: the Presentence\nInvestigation Report (PSR), Judgment, Statement of Reasons\n(SOR), and Central Inmate Monitoring (CIM) documentation (in\ncases where a CIM assignment is necessary). The DSCC will refer all requests for initial designation with\npotential medical/mental health concerns to the Office of\nMedical Designations and Transfers (OMDT), Health Services\nDivision, Washington, D.C. no later than the following work\nday. 1. DESIGNATION PROCEDURES The following is the normal chronology of an initial designation. a. The inmate is sentenced. b. The Clerk of the Court transmits the Judgment and\nCommitment Order (old law cases) or Judgment in a\nCriminal Case (new law cases) to the USMS. c. The USMS makes a request to the DSCC advising\nthat the inmate is now ready for designation to a\nfacility. d. If it has not already been provided, DSCC staff must\ncontact the necessary officials (USPO or USMS) for the\nfollowing: two copies of the PSR, a copy of the Judgment, to\ninclude the SOR, and the Individual Custody and Detention\nReport (USM-129). If the SOR is not provided with the Judgment, DSCC staff will\nmake a reasonable effort to obtain a copy by contacting the\nCourt or USPO. If no SOR\nwas prepared for the case or cannot be obtained, DSCC staff\nwill note this in the \u201cRemarks\u201d section of the BP-337 and\nproceed with the designation process. These procedures will\nensure the Bureau is following the intentions of the Court when\ndesignating a facility, as the SOR may contain information\nwhich overrides the PSR and may affect scoring decisions.",

Based on a review of the data, DSCC staff will determine whether\na non-federal facility should be designated. If a PSR has not\nbeen prepared, DSCC staff will complete a National Crime P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 3, Page 2\nInformation Center (NCIC) and National Law Enforcement\nTelecommunication System (NLETS) criminal history check to\nobtain background information. DSCC staff will then load\nappropriate information on the SENTRY Update Security\nDesignation screen with a notation that no PSR was available. DSCC staff will contact the USPO and\nrequest that a Postsentence Investigation Report be prepared,\nand forwarded to the designated facility. DSCC staff\nwill document this contact on the SENTRY Update Security\nDesignation Screen. Frequently, in cases involving Reentry after Deportation,\nPresentence/Postsentence Investigation Reports are not\nprepared. In those particular cases, a Magistrate Information\nSheet may be used. A Magistrate Information Sheet is a document\nprepared by\nU.S. law enforcement officials. This document contains a summary\nof the facts related to the defendant's arrest and prior\ncriminal/personal history. This information is primarily\nobtained through the arresting officer's report, the FBI Rap\nSheet and an interview with the defendant. If more than six months has elapsed since the PSR was prepared,\nDSCC staff will contact the USPO to determine if there is any\nnew or significant information that should be considered. If\nthe offender was a study case before final sentencing, DSCC\nstaff will take into consideration the results of that study in\ncompleting the designation request. The result of the study may\nbe obtained from a PSR, a summary report, or any other\ninformation available. If offense or background information is not available\nprior to designation, an inmate must be designated to at\nleast a Low security level institution. When information is\nobtained, the institution may request redesignation, if\nappropriate. e. The DSCC uses classification material and SENTRY to\ndetermine if Central Inmate Monitoring (CIM) precautions need to\nbe taken. This includes a name search to determine if the\noffender was previously confined under the current or previous\nregister number. If new to the Bureau, the inmate must be loaded\ninto SENTRY and \"admitted\" to the DSCC \"facility,\" with any\nappropriate CIM assignment(s) entered. DSCC staff will identify\nthe documents used to support CIM assignments and forward the\ndocuments to the designated institution. f. DSCC staff will complete and enter into SENTRY an Inmate\nLoad and Security Designation form (BP-337) on all cases with\nterms exceeding 30 days.

If there is no physical release from custody,\nDSCC staff will consider the state offense as part of the\ncurrent term of confinement for classification purposes and\nwill not assign any history points for the state offense. g. Each work day, DSCC Designation Officers determine which\ncases require designation by displaying a SENTRY Daily Log for\na listing of those cases entered the previous day (also to\ninclude weekends and holidays). The\nDesignator displays the Initial Designation Data screen and\nfollows the prompts on the screen. This will lead the\nDesignator through a display of the \u201cCIM Clearance and\nSeparatee Data\u201d screen and \u201cUpdate Security Designation\u201d\nscreen. A list of the appropriate security level\nfacilities will appear in order of proximity to the inmate\u2019s\nlegal residence (based on mileage calculated by SENTRY). The\nfinal screen in this series requires that the reason for\ndesignation be entered, as well as any clearance remarks by\nthe DSCC Designator. The objective of inmate classification is to place each\ninmate in the most appropriate facility for service of\nsentence. To\naccomplish this, the Designator must consider all relevant\ninformation regarding the inmate. In accordance with Rule 38(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, when the court of conviction recommends that the\ninmate be retained in a place of confinement which will allow\nthe inmate to participate in the preparation of the appeal, the\nBureau will make every effort to place the inmate in such a\nfacility. If a reason exists for not placing the inmate in that\nfacility, the matter is called to the attention of the court\nand an attempt is made to arrive at an acceptable place of\nconfinement. h. SENTRY provides information on the capacity and inmate\npopulation in each institution. Specifically, for each facility\nand each Designation Facility (DFCL), SENTRY provides the Rated\nCapacity, the Designation Capacity, and the percentage of each\nthat the facility or DFCL currently houses. \u2022 The Rated Capacity is a measure of the\ncapacity for which each DFCL was designed. \u2022 The Designation Capacity is the equitable\nproportion of the inmates in a particular security\nlevel that each P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 3, Page 4\ndesignation facility having that security\nlevel should house. The Designation Capacity of each DFCL is based on the rated\ncapacities and population totals of all the DFCLs that have the\nsame security level. The Rated Capacity and Designation Capacity\nfor a facility are calculated as the total Rated Capacity and\nDesignation Capacity of all the DFCLs that exist within that\nfacility. Designators will ordinarily use the Designation Capacity as\na guide for maintaining population balance and an equitable\ndistribution of inmates. However, for newly activating\ninstitutions, Designators may designate that institution for\na percentage of initial designations. i. The Designator assigns a facility, which may include\na privately managed facility, and will make every effort to\naccommodate recommendations from the courts, ie.",

Upon completion of the initial designation by the DSCC\nDesignator or Central Office Medical Designator, staff in\nthe following areas will make note of the designation by\nmonitoring SENTRY Destination Daily Logs:\n(1) The receiving institution;\n(2) The federal facility (MCC, Detention Center,\netc.) holding the inmate being designated;\n(3) The U.S. Marshals Prisoner Transportation\nDivision in Kansas City, Kansas; and,\n(4) The DSCC staff in cases where a\nmedical/mental health inmate has been referred to\nOMDT. DSCC staff will inform the USMS who has custody of the inmate\nof the designation by whatever means is appropriate. If the inmate is a former study case, DSCC staff must also\ninform, via GroupWise, the Warden of the institution that\ncompleted the study of the designation. This alerts that\nfacility to forward the Inmate Central File and other\nrecords to the institution designated. If there is a secondary designation (e.g., Parole, Special\nParole Term, Mandatory Release Violator Hearing, or following\nmedical treatment), DSCC staff (or Central Office Medical\nDesignator for P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 3, Page 5\nmedical cases) will notify the Warden of the secondary\ninstitution. This will alert the secondary institution that the\ninmate is designated and will be transported after the program\nor medical treatment is completed. No other designation notation\nis needed for a secondary designation. k. When a designation is made, DSCC staff will forward all\nsupporting documents to the designated institution within two\nworking days. If DSCC staff believe that the inmate will arrive\nat the institution in less than five calendar days, the\nsupporting documentation will be sent to the institution by\novernight mail, facsimile, or electronically, within one\nworking day of the designation. l. The Case Management Coordinator (CMC) will monitor all\npending arrivals at that facility. However, if the institution\nhas separate DFCLs for specialized programs (i.e., RDAP, Sex\nOffender Treatment Program, Life Connections, etc.) or for a\nsatellite camp, then the CMC may delegate this responsibility\nto staff assigned to those specialized programs or populations. Staff will monitor the Daily Log for that facility, and will\nprint a hard copy of each designation and maintain a copy on\nfile for 120 calendar days. In certain facilities other\nmethods may be just as effective in monitoring pending\narrivals. For example, institutions with a large holdover or\npretrial population can be monitored more effectively by running\na daily pipeline roster filtering out all \u201cA-HLD\u201ds and \u201cA-PRE\u201ds. Staff will also monitor the arrival of classification material,\nand if such material has not arrived within 10 calendar days\nfollowing the designation, the DSCC will be contacted to\ndetermine the status of that material. Upon arrival of the\nclassification material, the CMC, or designee, will review that\nmaterial and verify the scoring of the Inmate Load and Security\nDesignation form (BP-337). If a scoring issue and/or error is\ndiscovered, the CMC will contact the DSCC Administrator via\nGroupWise.

P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 3, Page 6 If the original designation is changed, the CMC will\nforward the classification material to the newly designated\ninstitution. m. The CMC has oversight responsibilities for monitoring\nthe timely arrival of a newly designated inmate. If an inmate\nserving a term of one year or more has not arrived at the\ndesignated institution within 120 calendar days from the date\nof the designation, or if an inmate serving a term of less\nthan one year has not arrived after 30 calendar days, staff\nwill use SENTRY to determine the inmate's current location:\n(1) If the inmate is in a Bureau facility, staff will\ncontact that facility to expedite movement or ascertain\nthe reason for delay, and will verify whether the\ndesignation continues to be valid; and,\n(2) If the inmate is not in a Bureau facility, staff will\ncontact the DSCC. Upon notification, DSCC staff will contact the\nappropriate authorities and ascertain why the inmate has not\narrived at the designated institution. If DSCC staff decides the\ndesignation is no longer valid, the DSCC will cancel the\noriginal designation. If the designation is canceled, the packet will be returned to\nthe DSCC, who then will return the documentation to the\noriginating agency.

NON-ROUTINE DESIGNATION PROCEDURES In certain cases, non-routine designation procedures for new\ncommitments are required. Listed below are specific examples of\nnon-routine designations. a. Study Cases. The DSCC will complete an Inmate Load and\nSecurity Designation form (BP-337) and enter it into SENTRY. The\nDSCC will then notify the Central Office Medical Designator via\nGroupWise requesting designation. The Central Office Medical\nDesignator will designate an appropriate institution for the\nstudy. After completion of the study and final sentencing by the\ncourt, the DSCC will enter a new Inmate Load and Security\nDesignation form (BP-337) into SENTRY, based on the actual\nsentence imposed or other new information. b. Medical or Mental Health. The DSCC is responsible for\nreceiving and evaluating information pertaining to an initial\ndesignation. DSCC staff must attempt to ascertain whether an\ninmate requires medical or mental health evaluation or\ntreatment. This information is ordinarily obtained from the\nPresentence Investigation Report or other source documents. If\nmedical or mental health concerns are apparent, DSCC staff will\nprovide comments in the \"Remarks\" section of the BP-337 and enter\nY (yes) in the OMDT REF item. DSCC staff will fax portions of\nthe Presentence Investigation Report pertaining to the medical\nor mental health concerns, and the Judgment in a Criminal Case,\nif it includes any judicial recommendations, to the Central\nOffice Medical Designator. Upon review of the daily log for W DESIG M cases, the Central\nOffice Medical Designator will access the Inmate Load and\nSecurity Designation form (BP-337) in SENTRY and make a\ndesignation based on the available information, ordinarily\nwithin three working days. If the Central\nOffice Medical Designator determines there are no medical or\nmental health concerns affecting placement, the DSCC will be\nadvised. The DSCC will then complete the designation\nto an appropriate institution. Only the OMDT will make designations for study cases or for\ncases requiring medical or psychiatric evaluation or\ntreatment. Designation may be made to any Bureau facility\nhaving resources to meet the inmate's needs. The Central Office\nMedical Designator will ensure that whenever a designation is\nmade to an DFCL inconsistent with the inmate's security level,\nthe appropriate Management Variable is entered. Administrative facilities are\nexcluded from this requirement. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 3, Page 8\nc. Military Prisoners. The Bureau cooperates with the\nSecurity, Force Protection and Law Enforcement Division of the\nArmed Services for the transfer of military prisoners into the\nBureau's custody. These cases are coordinated through the DSCC,\nin accordance with the provisions contained in Chapter 7,\nSection 17(d). d. Parole, Mandatory Release or Special Parole Term Violator\nHearing. For designation purposes, the U.S. Parole Commission\n(USPC) provides the revocation packet and a copy of the alleged\nviolator's Presentence Investigation Report to the DSCC. The\nDSCC will complete an initial designation to a violator hearing\nsite, and a secondary designation to a post-hearing institution\nfor service of the violator term.

Once the designation has been completed, the DSCC will\nnotify the U.S. Marshals Office of the designated institution,\nand mail the violator packet to that institution. The USPC will\nreceive notification via Groupwise. If after the hearing, new information causes a change in the\nsecondary designation (i.e., short-term parole date),\ninstitution staff will contact the DSCC for appropriate\naction.\n\u2022 In cases where the projected release date (PRD) is\nbetween 60 to 120 days from the date of hearing,\nthe DSCC will consider changing the secondary\ndesignation to the nearest appropriate facility. \u2022 In cases where the PRD is 60 days or less from the\ndate of hearing, hearing facility staff will\nconsider having the inmate remain at the hearing\nfacility for release processing purposes. \u2022 If a change in designation is not necessary,\ninstitution staff may process the inmate\u2019s\ntransfer to the secondary designation. Procedures for violators requiring medical treatment are\nreferenced in Chapters 3 and 7. Once the information is reviewed\nand evaluated by the DSCC, and it is determined that medical or\npsychiatric treatment is required, the request for designation\nwill be entered into SENTRY and referred to the Central Office\nMedical Designator for designation. The DSCC will notify the\nappropriate USMS Office of the inmate\u2019s designated institution,\nand mail the violator packet to that institution. The USPC will\nreceive notification via LAN. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 3, Page 9\nLocal revocation hearings will be conducted at a site\ndetermined by the USPC, normally within commuting distance of\nwhere the alleged violation occurred. The USPC may request, in\nwriting, to the DSCC Administrator that an alleged violator be\nmoved to a Bureau institution. Violators who have received their\nlocal revocation hearing will not be transported until the USPC\nNotice of Action has been received and a designation has been\ndetermined. In some instances, violators who are granted a\nshort-term release date should be considered for placement in a\ncontract facility. e. Long-term Detainees. The Detention Services Branch (DSB),\nCorrectional Programs Division, Central Office, is responsible\nfor the initial designation of long-term detainees. Requests for\nplacement into the BOP from the U.S. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement (ICE) are sent directly to DSB, where they are\ncompleted. If a medical or mental health placement is needed,\nDSB will refer it to the Central Office Medical Designator. Long-term detainees are no longer serving a sentence but their\ndetention is indeterminate and they will not, in all\nprobability, be repatriated to their home country. Long-term detainees are from countries, such as Cuba, that\nrefuse to accept their return from the U.S. government. The\nDetention Services Branch, Correctional Programs Division, will\nadvise when changes in applicable countries occur. This does\nnot include citizens from countries that take a significant\namount of time to accept its citizens. Travel orders can be\nobtained and they are eventually returned.

DESIGNATIONS TO NON-FEDERAL FACILITIES The DSCC may designate a federal inmate to a non-federal\nfacility in accordance with the criteria below. An updated\nSecurity Designation form (BP-337) will be completed and\nentered into SENTRY for any sentence exceeding 30 days. When\nthe USMS takes custody of an inmate from state or local custody\nto begin serving a federal sentence, the same procedures for\nnew commitments will be followed. When designating an inmate to a non-federal facility for an\ninmate, Designators shall consider the inmate's religious\nbeliefs, if known as one of the factors in making a designation\ndecision. If possible, a non-federal facility where the inmate's\nreligious beliefs can be accommodated will be designated. If\nnecessary, Designators may consult with Central Office\nchaplaincy staff in making this designation decision. 4. TYPES OF COMMITMENTS a. Juvenile Commitments. All inmates committed under the\nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) and\nall inmates under the age of 18 will be designated and\nhoused in accordance with the requirements of Program\nStatement Juvenile Delinquents, Juvenile Justice and\nDelinquency Prevention Act. The CCM will complete a BP-337 for juvenile offenders housed in\ncontract juvenile facilities; however, the CCM does not need to\ncomplete the BP-338 while the juvenile is housed there unless\nit is helpful to do so. b. Jail Commitments. When funds and appropriate jail space\nare available, the DSCC may designate a contract jail or\ndetention facility for an inmate who is generally sentenced\nto one year or less. If funds and appropriate jail space\nare not available or if an inmate has special needs, a\nfederal institution will be designated through the DSCC. Prior to placement, DSCC staff must determine whether\nany PSF(s) or other circumstances would contradict a jail\ndesignation. If so, the lowest security level dictated\nby the applicable PSF must be satisfied. However, such designations should also take into\nconsideration underpopulated Bureau facilities prior to\nplacement in a contract facility. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 3, Page 11\nc.

The term \"State\"\nas used in this section includes any state, territory, or\npossession of the United States. The statute does not permit the\nBureau to contract placement of state prisoners in third party\ncustody. This includes CCC placements. When there is a compelling reason for placing a state prisoner\nin a non-federal facility, institution staff will contact the\nDSCC Administrator, who may suggest to officials of the state\nthat they may want to make their own direct placement in a\nnon- federal facility. Once an inmate is accepted into Bureau custody, occasionally,\nthere may be a reason to return the inmate to the original\nstate. In this instance, institutional staff will contact the\nDSCC Administrator. If the DSCC Administrator determines that it\nwould be appropriate for the inmate to be returned, they will\ncontact state officials.

In practice, inmates are\nentered into SENTRY whether or not the inmate\u2019s security level\nis scored (e.g., pre-trial detainees, material witnesses,\netc.). Therefore, when the initial security designation data is\nentered into SENTRY it is essential that the load data is\ncompared to the information contained in the Presentence\nInvestigation Report (PSR), and that the information is updated\nor reconciled as appropriate. 1.

Staff will consider\nthe offense behavior on all sentences, including federal\nsentences that have a future beginning date or a previous D.C.\nor state sentence if there was no physical release from custody. NOTE: This will require DSCC staff to make reasonable efforts\nto obtain documentation. Severity is determined by using the Offense Severity\nScale (Appendix A). Example: According to the PSR, the individual was involved in an\nAssault With Serious Injury (Greatest severity level) but pled\nguilty to a Simple Assault (Moderate severity level). Assign the\npoints on the basis of the more severe documented behavior,\ni.e., assign 7 points (Greatest severity level).

If the pending charges or detainer\ninvolve a probation violation, use the most severe\ndocumented behavior in the original offense as the\nbasis for assigning points in scoring the\ndetainer. If law enforcement officials indicate a firm intent\nto lodge a detainer, consider it lodged. Score a\nconcurrent state sentence as a detainer only if it\nis expected that the state sentence will exceed the\nfederal sentence. However, score consecutive state\nsentences, lodged state detainers, and/or state\nparole violation terms/warrants as detainers. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 4, Page 12\n\u2022 Consecutive federal sentences are ordinarily not\nlodged as detainers because federal sentences are\ncomputed as they are received. If there is more\nthan one sentence, the most severe offense will be\nused as \u201cSeverity of Current Offense.\u201d Example: 12. For an individual with two detainers for\nViolation of Firearms Act (Moderate\nseverity level) and one for Extortion\n(High severity level), use High = 5 points\nand enter \"5\". \u2022 No points will be awarded for U.S. Parole Commission\nwarrants (adjudicated or unadjudicated). However, the\noriginal offense behavior will be factored into the\ncriminal history points and the violation behavior\n(including new offense behavior) will be scored as\nthe instant offense. \u2022 No points will be awarded for ICE detainers. However,\neach case will be carefully reviewed to determine\nwhether the PSF for Deportable Alien is applicable. AGE 12. AGE 0 = 55 and over\n2 = 36 through 54 4 = 25 through 35\n8 = 24 or less SENTRY will automatically enter the appropriate number of points\nbased on the inmate\u2019s date of birth. Staff do not have to\nmanually enter an offender\u2019s age or points on the BP-337. If the\noffenders date of birth is unknown, SENTRY will default to a\nscore of 4 points. 13. EDUCATION LEVEL 13.

Application of a Management\nVariable requires review and approval by the DSCC\nAdministrator. When completing the BP-338, institution staff\nmay only enter a Management Variable which the DSCC previously\napproved and entered as a management reason. Otherwise, the DSCC\nis the only office authorized to enter a variable. A maximum\nof three Management Variables may be entered for each case. NOTE: SENTRY will not permit the simultaneous application of\nthe Greater Security and Lesser Security MGTVs. When a Management Variable no longer applies, institution\nstaff will remove the variable(s) accordingly. When no\nManagement Variable is required, institution staff will\ninsert the letter \"A\" (NONE) in the space to signify that no\nMGTV(s) apply. Management Variables entered at initial designation are\nmanually transferred to the BP-338, Custody\nClassification form. Request for Management Variable/Management Variable expiration\ndate. All requests to apply a Management Variable (MGTV) or to\nupdate the Management Variable Expiration Date (MVED) must be\nsubmitted to the DSCC via GroupWise using the 409 form. Requests\nfor Management Variables on WITSEC inmates are to be forwarded\nto the Inmate Monitoring Section, Central Office, Washington,\nDC. The following criteria will be utilized: Only the DSCC or Central Office staff can apply a MGTV and\nupdate a MVED, with the exception of \"I\" (Med/Psych), which\nwill be applied and reviewed by the Central Office Medical\nDesignator and \"U\" (Long-Term Detainee), which will be\napplied by the Detention Services Branch, Correctional\nPrograms Division, Central Office. When requesting a MGTV or an updated MVED, only sections four\nand six need to be completed on the form 409. This request\nshould normally be made to the DSCC within 21 calendar days\nfollowing the inmate's scheduled custody review to ensure the\nDSCC is receiving a current Custody Classification Form, BP-338. After approval by the Warden, the request may be routed from the\nunit or shared folders, and unit staff must enter a DST\nassignment using the Update Transaction.",

When requesting an updated MVED, staff are to indicate\nthe recommended expiration date on the top portion of form\n409. When a case with the MGTV of \"I\" (Med/Psych) is scheduled\nfor review and it is anticipated that this MGTV is no longer\napplicable, institution staff will complete all sections of\nform\n409 and forward the request to the Central Office Medical\nDesignator and the DSCC. The Central Office Medical Designator\nwill review the case for continuation or deletion of this\nMGTV. If this MGTV is no longer appropriate, the Central\nOffice Medical Designator will remove the MGTV. After the\nCentral Office Medical Designator removes the MGTV \"I,\" the\nDSCC will review the case for transfer. If a transfer is\nnot appropriate, another MGTV is to be applied. Expiration dates will be assigned in accordance with Table 51. The DSCC Administrator must evaluate the information on the\nform\n409 to determine the appropriate expiration date for all\napplicable Management Variables. At the established expiration\ndate, case management staff will review the current Management\nVariable(s) to determine appropriateness. In the rare instance\nwhen more than one MGTV is applied, all expiration dates will be\ndisplayed on the BP-338. When running a SENTRY roster, each MGTV\nand corresponding MVED will be displayed. Management Security Level (MSL). Upon application of any of the\nfollowing Management Variables: PSF Waived; Greater Security;\nLesser Security, the DSCC is to apply an overriding Management\nSecurity Level (MSL) to reflect the inmate\u2019s assessed security\nneeds. This MSL takes precedence over the security level\nreflected in SENTRY which is based upon the scored security\nlevel and the application of Public Safety Factors. Designation must be made to a DFCL commensurate with the\ninmate\u2019s security needs as reflected in the Management Security\nLevel. If there is an extenuating\ncircumstance in which an inmate\u2019s designation facility is\ninconsistent with his or her MSL, at least one additional nonMSL MGTV must be added to support and explain the inconsistency. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 5, Page 3 A None. No Management Variables apply. Institution\nstaff are permitted to enter this item. B Judicial Recommendation. The sentencing court may\nrecommend a specific institution or program. When\nconsistent with policies or when such actions are\nconsistent with sound correctional management, the\nBureau of Prisons attempts to satisfy judicial\nrecommendations. When this is not feasible, the court\nis notified in writing with an explanation outlining\nthe reasons for not satisfying that recommendation. D Release Residence. The Bureau of Prisons attempts to\nplace each inmate in an institution that is reasonably\nclose to the anticipated release area. Ordinarily,\nplacement within 500 miles of the release area is to be\nconsidered reasonable, regardless of whether there may\nbe an institution closer to the inmate\u2019s release area.",

To the extent practicable, placement to the closest\nfacility within 500 driving miles of the release area\nwill be considered reasonable, subject to bed\navailability, the prisoner\u2019s security designation, the\nprisoner\u2019s programmatic needs, the prisoner\u2019s mental\nand medical health needs, any request made by the\nprisoner related to faith-based needs, recommendations\nof the sentencing court, and other security concerns of\nthe Bureau of Prisons. This MGTV may also apply to\ninmates who are within 36 months of release. E Population Management. Situations may occur in which\nan inmate requires housing in a facility which is not\ncommensurate with his or her security level. Following\nare example situations: facility activation;\npopulation pressures affecting available appropriatelevel bed space within 500 driving miles of the\ninmate\u2019s anticipated release residence; gang/security\nconcerns. G Central Inmate Monitoring Assignment. Pursuant to the\nCIM Program Statement, some inmates, for specified\nreasons, need to be monitored or separated from\nothers. Sometimes these special management concerns\nlimit the options for placement. I Medical or Psychiatric. An inmate who has a history of\nor is presently exhibiting psychiatric problems may\nneed an initial designation to a psychiatric referral\ncenter. Similarly, documented information reflecting\nthat the inmate may need medical or surgical treatment\nmay require a designation to a medical referral P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 5, Page 4\ncenter. Designations and redesignations of these\ninmates will be made by the Central Office Medical\nDesignator. N Program Participation. Occasionally, inmates become\ninvolved in specialized programs which are only\navailable on a limited basis, or at specific\ninstitutions; in such instances, it might be\nappropriate to delay transfer pending completion of\nthe program. Likewise, an inmate\u2019s ability to\nparticipate in a unique program may require placement\nat an institution not commensurate with his or her\nsecurity level. Accordingly, when an inmate's\nsecurity level changes during participation in a\nspecial program not likely to be available in another\nappropriate facility, causing placement outside\nnormal guidelines, this MGTV will apply. R Work Cadre. At secure facilities without satellite\ncamps, the Regional Director may authorize a certain\nnumber of work cadre inmates to perform work outside\nthe perimeter of the institution. The DSCC will apply\nthe MGTV upon request of the institution. S PSF Waived. An inmate may receive up to three Public\nSafety Factors (PSFs). PSFs may be waived after review\nand approval by the DSCC Administrator. When Public\nSafety Factors are waived causing placement outside\nnormal guidelines, this MGTV will apply. Application\nof this MGTV mandates that the DSCC Administrator\ndetermine the most appropriate level of security\nrequired by the inmate and apply a Management Security\nLevel (MSL). The MSL must be at least one level less\nthan the scored security level which is based on the\nSecurity Total and PSF(s). Request for Public Safety Factor Waiver. Only the DSCC\nAdministrator is authorized to waive a PSF. A request\nfor waiver of a PSF will be submitted to the DSCC via\nform 409, available on SALLYPORT.

Items 1 through 7 must be completed\nwhen submitting a request for waiver of a PSF. U Long-term Detainee. Long-term detainees are given an\ninitial custody and security level. However, Custody\nClassification Forms are not to be completed on\nlong- term detainees due to the unavailability\nor non- applicability of certain data (i.e.,\ncurrent term of confinement, length of time\nremaining to serve, accurate criminal history). P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 5, Page 5 Therefore, transfers for positive or negative behavior\nmay cause placement in a facility different from his or\nher scored security or custody level. When needed, this\nMGTV will be applied by the Detention Services Branch,\nCorrectional Programs Division, Central Office. Long-term criminal detainees whose security or custody\nlevel does not match that of their facility will have\nthis Management Variable applied. This applies as well\nif an inmate rolls over to the status of a long-term\ndetainee after being ordered detained upon expiration\nof the federal sentence and the security or custody\nlevel does not match that of the designated facility. V Greater Security. There may be security concerns which\nare not adequately reflected in the classification\nscheme. In circumstances where an inmate represents a\ngreater security risk (i.e., pending charges,\ndetainer, escape risk, etc.) than their assigned\nsecurity level, they may be placed in an institution\noutside normal guidelines, and this MGTV will apply. When this MGTV is applied based on institutional\nbehavior which is not supported by a UDC/DHO finding\nof guilt, staff will ensure compliance with the\ncriteria as set forth in the Program Statement on\nInmate Discipline and Special Housing Units. Application of this MGTV mandates the DSCC\nAdministrator determine the most appropriate level of\nsecurity required by the inmate and apply a\nManagement Security Level (MSL). Designation will\nthen be made to a DFCL commensurate with the inmate\u2019s\nManagement Security Level. The MSL must be at least\none level greater than the scored security level\nwhich is based on the Security Total and Public\nSafety Factor(s). This MGTV requires up to a\n24 month expiration date. W Lesser Security. There may be security concerns which\nare not adequately reflected in the classification\nscheme. In circumstances where an inmate represents a\nlesser security risk (i.e., detainer removed, positive\nadjustment, etc.) than the assigned security level,\nthe inmate may be placed in an institution outside\nnormal guidelines. For example, where age is largely\nthe contributing factor in the inmate\u2019s placement,\nthis Management Variable will apply. Application of this MGTV mandates the DSCC\nAdministrator to determine the most appropriate level\nof security required by the inmate and apply a\nManagement Security Level (MSL).

Public Safety Factors are\nnormally applied on the Inmate Load and Security Designation\nForm (BP-337) prior to an inmate\u2019s initial assignment to an\ninstitution, however, additions or deletions may be made at\nanytime there after via the Custody Classification Form, (BP338). A maximum of three PSFs may be applied, however\nif more than three apply, those which would provide the greatest\nsecurity and public safety will be utilized. CODE PSF - DESCRIPTION A None. B Disruptive Group. A male inmate who is a validated\nmember of a Disruptive Group identified in the\nCentral Inmate Monitoring System will be housed in\na High security level institution, unless the PSF\nhas been waived. No Public Safety Factors apply. At the time of initial designation, if the\nPresentence Investigation Report or other\ndocumentation identifies the inmate as a possible\nmember of one of the Central Inmate Monitoring\nDisruptive Groups, DSCC staff will enter a PSF on the\nBP-337. However, DSCC staff will not\nenter the CIM assignment \"Disruptive Group.\" Upon\nloading this PSF on a not-yet-validated member, DSCC\nstaff will (1) make a notation in the Remarks Section\nto indicate the need for validation upon arrival at\nthe institution, and (2) notify the Central Office\nIntelligence Section, via GroupWise, to advise them\nof the inmate\u2019s status. Upon the inmate's arrival\nat the designated institution, the intake screener\nwill notify the institution's Special Investigation\nSupervisor of the inmate's PSF, to initiate the\nvalidation process. C Greatest Severity Offense. A male inmate whose current\nterm of confinement falls into the \"Greatest Severity\"\nrange according to the Offense Severity Scale\n(Appendix\nA) will be housed in at least a Low security\nlevel institution, unless the PSF has been\nwaived.

Custody classification is a procedure whereby an\ninmate is assigned a level of supervision according to their\ncriminal history and institutional behavior/adjustment. An\ninmate\u2019s custody level is an indication of how much staff\nsupervision an inmate requires within and beyond the confines\nof the institution. An inmate\u2019s first custody classification will be scored at the\nfirst program review following initial classification\n(approximately 7 months after arrival at an institution). Subsequent reviews will occur at least every 12 months, but\nmay be conducted earlier in order to enable progress toward\ncommunity activities. Custody classification will ordinarily\noccur every 12 months at a regularly scheduled program review. Only changes\nwhich increase or decrease the overall security level\nassignment of the inmate, i.e. FRP refuse, incident report(s),\nnew sentence, sentence reduction etc., should be scored outside\nof the 12 month cycle.",

Only changes\nwhich increase or decrease the overall security level\nassignment of the inmate, i.e. FRP refuse, incident report(s),\nnew sentence, sentence reduction etc., should be scored outside\nof the 12 month cycle. When transferring to another institution, inmates normally\nretain their custody assignments. If the custody level is\ninconsistent with that authorized at the receiving\ninstitution, the sending institution will change the inmate's\ncustody prior to transfer. Holdovers\nwill\nretain\ntheir\ninitial\ncustody\nlevel\nassignments until their first regularly scheduled custody\nreview at their designated facility for service of sentence. At each annual custody review, a new Custody\nClassification Form (BP-338) will be completed, even\nthough the scoring elements\nmay not have changed from the previous form. Only the most\ncurrent BP-338 form will be retained in the Inmate Central\nFile, except for those forms that must be retained to\ndocument appropriate review and approval for custody\nreductions (e.g., custody reductions for exception cases\nrequire the Warden, or designee, to sign the Custody\nClassification Form. The form should\nbe maintained to document the review and approval). As set\nforth in the definition of \u201cMaximum\u201d custody, Chapter 2, a\nBP-338 form changing an inmate\u2019s custody to or from \u201cMaximum\u201d\ncustody must be permanently maintained. It should be clearly understood that the Custody Classification\nForm only recommends an inmate's custody. The Unit Team and/or\nWarden is the final review authority.

Therefore, unit staff must reconcile\ninformation obtained since the inmate\u2019s previous score\non this item. In addition to the points assigned for the education level,\nthe highest grade completed (HGC) will also be recorded on the\nBP337. For example an inmate who began but did not complete the\n7th grade will be given a 6 in the HGC field. Similarly, a GED\nwill be given a 12, a college graduate a 16, a Master\u2019s degree\nan 18, and a Ph.D. a 21 (the maximum allowed) in the HGC\nfield. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 6, Page 9\n10.

While it is mandatory that COMMUNITY custody be effected at the\ntime of transfer, it may not be appropriate to reduce the\ninmate\u2019s custody level prior to the date of transfer (e.g., it\nwould not be appropriate for an IN custody inmate at a MEDIUM\nsecurity level institution to have COMMUNITY custody while still\nhoused at the institution). In such cases, upon receipt of a CCC\nacceptance date, a SENTRY future assignment would be established\nfor the date of transfer. The effective time for the reduction\nwould be 12:01 AM.

Transfers (also known as redesignations)\nare used to move inmates from one institution to another as\nneeded, with each type of transfer having a specific\nobjective. The following are some of the more frequent\nreasons for a transfer:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 institution classification;\nnearer release;\ndisciplinary/close supervision;\nadjustment;\nmedical/psychological treatment;\ntemporary transfers;\ntraining purposes/program participation;\nInstitution Hearing Program;\npre-release; and,\ntransfers from CCC\u2019s. After review and approval by the Unit Team, a transfer\nrequest is submitted via the Request for Transfer/Application\nof Management Variable (409) to the DSCC. The procedures for\ncompleting the 409 are outlined below and may only be waived\nor modified with the approval of the Assistant Director,\nCorrectional Programs Division, Washington, D.C. or his/her\ndesignee. 1. Inmate\u2019s Medical Status. Include current, complete, and\naccurate available information concerning any medical problem\nthat might affect redesignation;\n2. Institution Adjustment. Include a brief description of the\ninmate's adjustment during this period of incarceration with\nemphasis on recent adjustment;\n3. Rational for Referral. Include a complete, specific\njustification and support for the requested action;\n4. Parole Hearing Scheduled. Indicate whether or not the\ninmate is eligible for a parole hearing. If yes, indicate the\ndate of the hearing. (See SALLYPORT for a current listing of\nparole/non-parole institutions). 5. Past or Present Behavior and/or Management Concerns. Note\nany past or present behavior and/or management concerns which\nmay affect placement (i.e., history of arrests or disruptive\nbehavior P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 2\nwhich may not have resulted in a conviction, inmates\npreference regarding this request, etc.). Also note any\nSecurity Threat Group concerns/associations. In addition, it is\nnecessary for staff to closely review each case submitted for\nany CIM concerns. Any CIM concerns should be noted on the 409\nif applicable. However, it is not necessary for staff to route a Request for\nCIM Activity Clearance with each transfer request since CIM\nactivity clearance is included in the redesignation for all\nCIM assignments except WITSEC cases. Redesignations between\nsame security level institutions are discouraged, except for\nCIM purposes, nearer release purposes, or other unusual\ncircumstances. Copies of all transfer requests for Disruptive\nGroup Members will be forwarded to the Intelligence Section,\nCentral Office, via GroupWise upon approval of the transfer. Additionally, the institution Special Investigative\nSupervisor should also receive a copy of the transfer\nrequest; and\n6. BP-337/BP-338 Discrepancies. Include a brief description\nof any scoring changes between the BP-337 and BP-338.",

Include a brief description\nof any scoring changes between the BP-337 and BP-338. Complete all required information, then route the request\nthrough normal institutional review channels for approval by\nthe CEO. After approval by the CEO, it may be routed\nto the DSCC Administrator from the unit\u2019s mailbox. The Unit\nTeam will enter the appropriate \u201cDST\u201d assignment (see below)\ninto SENTRY as confirmation that a redesignation request has\nbeen submitted to the DSCC or OMDT. Enter this SENTRY\nassignment under the \"DST\" category using the \u201cUpdate Inmate\nAssignment\u201d transaction.\n\u2022 Enter \u201cW REDES R\u201d if the transfer request is\nfor a routine transfer. \u2022 Enter \u201cW REDES M\u201d if the transfer request\nrequires a review by the OMDT (Medical\nDesignator). Once the e-mail requesting redesignation is received,\nDSCC staff will at a minimum review the following SENTRY\ntransactions to determine if the inmate is appropriate for\nredesignation:\nCIM Clearance and Separatee Data;\nInmate Load Data;\nInmate Profile;\nCustody Classification Form;\nSecurity/Designation Data Form; and,\nChronological Disciplinary Record. If the transfer is approved, DSCC staff will enter the\ninformation and the appropriate destination (DST) assignment in P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 3\nSENTRY on the \u201cEnter Redesignation\u201d screen and will also note\nthe approved institution transfer code. The method of\ntransportation is at the discretion of the Warden. Should a\nchange in DST be required, DSCC staff will make the change in\nSENTRY prior to the inmate\u2019s arrival at the designated\ninstitution. If the transfer is denied, DSCC staff will indicate the\ndenial on the \u201cUpdate Inmate Remarks\u201d screen and will also\ndelete the \u201cW REDES\u201d from SENTRY. Unit staff should closely\nmonitor SENTRY for deletions of the \u201cW REDES\u201d transaction. 1. INSTITUTION CLASSIFICATION TRANSFERS. These transfers are\ntypically referred to as either \u201cLesser Security\u201d (Code 308)\ntransfers or \u201cGreater Security\u201d (Code 307) transfers.\na. Security Level Changes\n(1) When a decrease in the inmate\u2019s security level is\nindicated by the Custody Classification Form, transfer\nof the inmate to a lower security level institution\nshould be considered. (2) Likewise, an increased security level may be\nindicated in a similar fashion. The security total may\nincrease to a higher security level range. If an updated security scoring, combined with Public Safety\nFactors, indicate that an inmate is rated at a different\nsecurity level, the inmate must be referred to the DSCC for\nFor\neither transfer or application of a Management Variable. example, if an inmate in a Low security level institution is\nreclassified to Minimum security, the case must be referred for\ntransfer or application of a Management Variable. If transfer is\ndenied, DSCC staff will apply an appropriate Management Variable\nand add a Management Security Level, if applicable. b. Custody Level Changes. During an inmate's custody review,\na custody level may be increased or decreased (ordinarily, only\none level at a time) indicating a transfer is appropriate. For\nexample:\n(1) A Medium security level inmate has OUT custody,\nand becomes eligible for COMMUNITY custody. If the Unit\nTeam decides to reduce custody, the inmate would normally\nbe referred for redesignation to a Low or Minimum\nsecurity level facility, since Medium security level\ninstitutions do not house COMMUNITY custody inmates.",

If the Unit\nTeam decides to reduce custody, the inmate would normally\nbe referred for redesignation to a Low or Minimum\nsecurity level facility, since Medium security level\ninstitutions do not house COMMUNITY custody inmates. If\napproved for transfer by the DSCC, the Management\nVariable of Lesser Security will be applied and the\nManagement Security Level will be changed accordingly. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 4\n(2) An inmate's transfer to a higher security\ninstitution could be triggered by an increase in custody\nneeds. For example, a Medium security level inmate with\nIN custody becomes eligible for a custody increase. The\nteam agrees to increase the custody to Maximum. Since\nMedium security level facilities are not authorized to\nhouse Maximum custody inmates, the inmate must be\nreferred for transfer to a High security level\ninstitution and the MSL changed in accordance with the\napplication of an MGTV. 2. NEARER RELEASE TRANSFERS (Code 313). Nearer release\ntransfers move the inmate closer to their legal residence or\nrelease destination, consistent with their security level. Inmates may be considered for a nearer release transfer only\nafter serving 18 consecutive months of clear conduct in a\ngeneral population. Nearer release transfers should be\nincorporated with \u201cLesser Security\u201d transfers whenever\npossible. Once the inmate has been transferred within 500\ndriving miles of his or her release residence, no further\nreferrals will be made for nearer release transfer\nconsideration. further referrals can be considered for nearer\nrelease transfer consideration subject to bed availability, the\nprisoner\u2019s security designation, the prisoner\u2019s programmatic\nneeds, the prisoner\u2019s mental and medical health needs, any\nrequest made by the prisoner related to faith- based needs,\nrecommendations of the sentencing court, and other security\nconcerns of the Bureau of Prisons. Transfer to a facility in an area other than the inmate's\nlegal residence or sentencing district may be considered by\nthe inmate's Unit Team provided the inmate can provide strong\nevidence of community and/or family support. Institution staff\nshould use sound correctional judgment when reviewing such\nrequests for transfer to ensure the transfer is consistent\nwith guidelines established in this chapter. Inmates with an Order for Deportation, an Order of Removal, an\nICE detainer for an unadjudicated offense(s) or an ICE\ndetainer for a hearing will not be transferred for nearer\nrelease purposes since they will be returning to the community\noutside, rather than inside, the United States upon release. 3. WITSEC TRANSFERS. All movement of Witness Security cases is\ncoordinated exclusively through the Inmate Monitoring Section\nof the Correctional Programs Branch, Central Office. Witness\nSecurity cases will not be transferred without authorization\nfrom that office. Witness Security inmates who require\nmedical or mental health treatment at a medical center must\nalso be approved by the Medical Designator. If the inmate is classified as a WITSEC case, a copy of the\nmedical referral will be sent simultaneously to the Inmate P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 5\nMonitoring Section (IMS) and the Medical Designator. The Inmate\nMonitoring Section will coordinate with the OMDT regarding an\nappropriate placement. Placement will be based on available\nmedical resources, security needs, bed space availability, and\nthe inmate's need for medical care. IMS will enter activity\nclearances for WITSEC cases. 4.

DISCIPLINARY/CLOSE SUPERVISION TRANSFERS (Codes 309/323). An\nact(s) of documented institution misconduct may result in an\ninmate\u2019s transfer to another institution, normally of greater\nsecurity, for disciplinary reasons. Wardens may recommend same\nsecurity level transfers only when placement at a greater\nsecurity level institution is not possible or other overriding\ncircumstances exist. Disciplinary or Close Supervision transfer requests will\nbe sent electronically to the DSCC Administrator and contain\nthe following information:\n(a) Request for Transfer/Application of\nManagement Variable (must be thorough and\nspecific); (b) Close Supervision investigation report, if\nrequested; and, (c) Intelligence data or supporting memorandum\nif requested. Institution staff should carefully review the management of\n309/323 cases on an individual basis, applying sound\ncorrectional judgment that considers the safety and security\nof the inmate, the institution and its staff and the\ncommunity. 5. ADJUSTMENT TRANSFERS (Code 330). All transfer referrals\nsubmitted as Code 330 transfers for adjustment purposes will be\nreviewed by the DSCC. Adjustment purposes transfer requests will\nbe sent electronically to the DSCC Administrator via Form 409. DSCC staff will ensure that the transfer does not meet the\nrequirements of an unverified protection transfer, Code 323. 6. MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC TRANSFERS (Codes 331-336 and\n338, 339). Medical designations and transfers are approved by\nthe Central Office Medical Designator, Office of Medical\nDesignations and Transportation (OMDT). The Central Office\nMedical Designator assigns inmates to Medical Referral\nCenters (MRC), institutions with medical resources, or nonBureau community care centers to provide needed medical\nservices. Medical redesignations are initiated for inmates with acute\nmedical, surgical, or psychiatric condition, or for those\ninmates who have chronic care needs that cannot be addressed at\nthe parent institution. Transfers will be classified as either P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 6\n(a) Emergency, (b) Routine/Urgent, or (c) Routine. If an inmate objects, either in writing or through his or her\nattorney, to a transfer for psychiatric/mental health treatment,\nthe provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245 may apply. Staff will suspend\ntransfer action in such cases and refer the matter to their\nRegional Counsel for review. The Regional Counsel will notify\nthe institution when the transfer action can be re-instituted. a. Emergency Transfer - An emergency transfer is a\nmedical, surgical, or psychiatric situation determined by\nmedical/mental health staff that requires immediate, direct\ntransportation. This includes inmates not medically or psychiatrically capable\nof transport via routine BOP air/surface transportation, e.g.,\nbus, commercial air, or USMS/Bureau airlift. Direct\ntransportation is defined as air ambulance, air charter, or\nground ambulance and, in some instances, an institution\nvehicle may be utilized. b. Routine/Urgent Transfer - A routine/urgent transfer is\ninitiated for medical, surgical, or psychiatric treatment\nthat is not an emergency, however must be transported\ndirectly to a MRC, typically within two to three weeks of\ndesignation. Routine urgent transfers require direct transfer to the MRC\nbecause of the acuity of their medical, surgical, or\npsychiatric condition, or because MRC-based services need to be\ninitiated within an appropriate time frame. Holdover housing at\na county jail or Bureau general population institution is not\npermissible. c. Routine Transfer -",

Holdover housing at\na county jail or Bureau general population institution is not\npermissible. c. Routine Transfer - A routine transfer is initiated\nfor medical, surgical, or psychiatric treatment that is\nnot an emergency and time en-route is not a major factor. Routine transfers may travel by any available means. d. Procedures for Initiating Emergency, Routine/Urgent,\nand Routine Transfer Requests. All transfer\nrequests for medical, surgical, or psychiatric designations\nwill be initiated via GroupWise on the Medical/Surgical and\nPsychiatric Referral Request Form (BP-770) available on\nSALLYPORT. The HSA, with input from the\nClinical Director and other providers involved with the\ninmate\u2019s care (e.g., mid-level providers, psychologists,\nconsultant physicians), is responsible for completing the BP770. The referring institution Warden must review the BP-770\nand authorize the request for transfer. The BP-770 serves as the redesignation, transportation, and\nsecurity worksheet from which the actual redesignation is\nmade. It will also serve as the emergency referral request\nform, documentation of the inmate\u2019s condition and the reason P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 7\nfor transfer. Accordingly, it is essential that the BP-770 be\ncompleted thoroughly and accurately. The Medical Designator will review each request for\nredesignation and approve or deny the requested transfer. Based\non clinical information and in consultation with the Medical\nDirector, the Medical Designator may change the urgency level of\nthe request. OMDT will authorize CIM clearance (if appropriate) and enter\napproved transfers to an appropriate BOP facility in SENTRY on\nthe \u201cEnter Redesignation\u201d screen. e. Completion of Treatment - All requests for\nredesignation to the parent facility upon completion of\nMedical/Surgical or Psychiatric treatment, or to another\nmedical facility for continuation of treatment, will be\ninitiated by the facility currently housing the inmate via\nGroupWise on the Discharge Transfer Summary form. This form\nserves as the designation, transportation, and security\nworksheet from which the redesignation is made. Medical cases are normally returned to their parent facility\nunless the DSCC approves a change in the parent facility based\non clinical justification provided prior to redesignation by\nthe Medical Designator. 7. TEMPORARY TRANSFERS. It is sometimes necessary to\ntemporarily transfer an inmate to a contract facility or other\nBureau institution. This is normally for security reasons, when\nthe current institution does not have a Special Housing Unit. In\nsuch cases, institution staff will forward a request for\ntemporary transfer approval from the Warden to the DSCC. The\nrequest will include the rationale for transfer, with assurance\nthat the receiving facility is in agreement with the temporary\ntransfer. Transfer approval must be obtained prior to the\ntransfer during normal working hours, or if after hours, the\nnext work day. A copy of this request will be routed to the\nappropriate CCM office, if the transfer is to a contract\nfacility. 8. TRANSFERS FOR TRAINING PURPOSES OR PROGRAM PARTICIPATION. An inmate is ordinarily only transferred for specialized\nnational programs not offered at the parent facility to\ninclude:\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d) Residential Drug Treatment Program;\nLife Connections Program;\nSpecial Management Unit; and\nSex Offender Programs.

Further, if the program facility is nearer to the\ninmate\u2019s release residence, than is the referring institution,\nthe inmate may remain at the program facility. 9.\nINSTITUTION HEARING PROGRAM TRANSFERS. The Institution\nHearing Program (IHP) is a coordinated effort by the Bureau,\nICE, and the EOIR to provide deportation or exclusion\nproceedings to sentenced aliens as expeditiously as possible\nafter the date of conviction. Eligibility,\ndesignation, classification, and transfer procedures are\nspecifically outlined in Bureau directives. IHP sites have been\nestablished for male and female non-U.S. citizens who are\nserving federal sentences to ensure a deportation or exclusion\nhearing is conducted early in their sentence instead of at the\nend of their sentence. 10. TRANSFERS TO SATELLITE CAMPS. The Warden of an institution\nwith a satellite camp may transfer an inmate from the main\ninstitution to the camp if the inmate is assigned an\nappropriate security and/or custody level. The Camp\nAdministrator of a satellite camp adjacent to a Low or Medium\nsecurity level institution may temporarily transfer the inmate\nto the main institution for disciplinary purposes (i.e.,\ndisciplinary segregation). If a need for an immediate\nredesignation arises, the inmate may be placed as a holdover in\nAdministrative Detention at the main institution while approval\nis sought from the DSCC for redesignation to that institution\nor another institution. An inmate may travel via \u201cunescorted transfer\u201d from a low or\nminimum security level institution to a minimum security level\ninstitution if the inmate is a minimum security level inmate\nand has OUT or COMMUNITY custody. The inmate\u2019s\nfamily (on the approved visiting list) may provide\ntransportation to the receiving institution only if the inmate\nis transferring from a minimum security level institution to\nanother minimum security level institution, and if approved by\nthe Warden. The inmate\u2019s family is expected\nto bear all transportation costs. The inmate\nmust go directly from the sending institution to the receiving\ninstitution. The Warden may authorize clearance for the transfer of a CIM\nCase, with the exception of WITSEC cases, to the satellite camp\nof the parent facility provided established regulations for\nregular transfer authority have been met. (Refer to the CIM\nManual for more specific details). P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 9\n11. PRE-RELEASE TRANSFERS. Inmates in federal and contract\ninstitutions may be transferred to CCCs in accordance with the\nProgram Statement Community Corrections Center (CCC)\nUtilization and Transfer Procedure. Inmates who have been\napproved for CCC referral and are otherwise appropriate for\ncamp placement are to be transferred to a camp for intermediate\nplacement if at all practicable. Inmates should be encouraged\nto complete all or most of the Institution Release Preparation\nProgram at the parent institution prior to transfer. The parent institution is to complete the CCC referral packet\nand the camp should be closer to the inmate\u2019s release residence.",

CCC referrals may be made 12 to 18 months in advance of\nan anticipated reporting date with the concurrence of local CCM\noffices. A notation that the CCC referral was made with a\nspecific projected placement date should be included in the\nrequest for institution transfer, and the transfer request\nshould be prepared at the same time as the CCC referral. 12. TRANSFERS FROM CCC\u2019S. When an inmate fails to meet the\nconditions of CCC placement, the CCM should designate the\ninmate to the parent institution with consideration given\nto the following criteria for designation:\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e) local manday detention rates;\navailability of Bureau Detention Centers;\nbudgetary constraints;\nprojected release date; and,\ndistance to parent facility. When returning the inmate to the parent institution is not\ncost effective, the Community Corrections Office will refer the\ncase to the DSCC for designation.

The authority for the redesignation of\nlong-term detainees rests with the Detention Services Branch,\nCorrectional Programs Division, Central Office. Refer to the\ncurrent Program Statement Mariel Cuban Detainees for transfer\nprocedures. Transfers for medical or mental health treatment\nhowever, shall be referred to the Central Office Medical\nDesignator. Mariel Cubans who are sentenced, and therefore not\ndetainees, are handled in a routine fashion by DSCC staff. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 10\n14. IN-TRANSIT DATA FORM a. Upon notice that an inmate is being transferred or\ntemporarily released to an authorized law enforcement\nofficer (e.g., U.S. Marshal, state law enforcement officer,\nor Bureau bus officer), the Unit Manager will ensure the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 The top portion of the SENTRY automated InTransit Data Form is accurate and the bottom\nportion is completed; \u2022 CIM, YCA, DCYRA and any other important information\nis included in the space for \"Non-Routine Security\nNeeds;\" \u2022 CIM separation information is accurate, up-to-date\nand the SENTRY generated \"CIM Clearance and Separatee\nData\" is attached to the In-Transit Data Form; and, \u2022 The In-Transit Data Form is signed, dated, and\nforwarded to ISM staff who will attach a\ncurrent inmate photograph and provide the form\nto the transporting officer.

TRANSFER CODES. The reason for transfer, as shown by one of\nthe codes listed at the end of this chapter, must be provided in\nthe top portion of the Transfer Order. If there is more than one\nreason for transfer, the most pertinent code should be used. Note that all Unescorted Transfers are Discharge Code FURL TRANS for Furlough Transfer. 16. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS a. An inmate having a detainer or pending charge may be\ntransferred to any institution for which he or she properly\nclassifies; however, generally when there is a formally filed\ndetainer, the inmate is not to be transferred to an\ninstitution more distant from the detaining authority unless\nthere is substantial reason to believe the detainer will be\ndropped or the pending charge will not be prosecuted. An inmate who indicates an intention to oppose extradition is\nnot to be transferred within the last 30 calendar days prior to\nrelease to an institution in the state that placed the\ndetainer. Such cases, and others in which there are legal or\njurisdictional problems, are to be referred to the Regional\nCorrectional Programs\nAdministrator (See Program Statement\nInmate Systems Management Manual. b. When there is reason to transfer an inmate to a nonfederal institution for concurrent service of federal and\nstate sentences, the Warden will refer the case to the DSCC\nAdministrator. Refer to the Program Statement, Transfer of a\nPrisoner to State Custody Prior to Release from the Federal\nSentence, for procedures. 17. RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER AGENCIES a. U.S. Parole Commission. Parolable inmates must be housed\nat a parolable institution in accordance with their parole\nhearing requirements unless a hearing is no longer required. b. Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The court of\nconviction may recommend to the Attorney General or the Bureau\nthat the defendant be retained at, or transferred to, a place\nof confinement near the place of trial or the court of appeals,\nfor a period reasonably necessary to permit the defendant to\nassist in the preparation of his or her appeal. Upon receiving\nthis recommendation, the Bureau will make every effort to place\nthe inmate in such a facility. If a reason exists for\nnot placing the inmate in that facility, the court must be\nnotified of the situation and an attempt will be made to arrive\nat an acceptable place of confinement. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 12\nOrdinarily, complicated jurisdictional or legal problems\nshould be resolved before transfer.

If so, the\nindividual should not be transferred without prior consultation\nwith the appropriate U.S. Attorney or Regional Counsel, or both. Under Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedures,\nan inmate may not be transferred, pending review of a Habeas\nCorpus proceeding commenced before a court, without the approval\nof the court. Approval for transfer should be sought through the U.S.\nAttorney or Regional Counsel in cases where a Habeas Corpus\npetition is pending. c. Non-Federal Authorities. The decision to accept a state\nprisoner in the Bureau is the responsibility of the DSCC\nAdministrator. When notifying the state authority of acceptance,\nthe state's contract code will be identified. The Office of Procurement, Central Office is responsible\nfor negotiating contracts for housing state prisoners. If it\nis necessary to transfer a federal inmate to a local jail,\nthe sending institution must immediately notify the U.S.\nMarshals and the CCM, preferably prior to the transfer. d. Military Inmates. The DSCC will accept a military or Coast\nGuard inmate recommended for transfer to federal custody if,\nafter examination of all available information, the Bureau\ncan provide appropriate resources for the inmate's needs. The\nDSCC will be responsible for the designation and redesignation\nof all military and Coast Guard inmates accepted for service\nof their sentence in Bureau custody. In some cases, special agreements or Memoranda of\nUnderstanding (MOU) have been established with various\nmilitary branches. These MOUs give direction to Bureau staff regarding which Bureau\nregulations and policies apply to the military inmates. Pursuant\nto 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 858, staff should be aware that military or Coast\nGuard inmates confined in Bureau institutions are subject to the\nsame discipline and treatment as other inmates in those\ninstitutions. Additionally, the Bureau will accept the sentence computation\nprovided by the military or Coast Guard authorities with the\nexception that the Bureau will release such inmates, if not\nparoled, under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164 provided they\nhave accrued good time deductions in excess of 180 days. DSCC\nstaff will refer to the appropriate military or Coast Guard\nauthorities for resolution of suspected sentence computation\nerrors or discrepancies, or challenges to the sentence\ncomputation by the inmate or his or her representative, or both. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 13 Once a military inmate comes into Bureau custody, all\nnotifications and requirements apply as if he or she were a\nBureau inmate, i.e., VWP notification, VCCLEA notification,\nSex Offender Notification, and IFRP requirements. Notification\nto the military is also required at least 30 days prior to\nthe inmate\u2019s release. 18. STATE PLACEMENT. Inmates who have exhausted available\nresources within the Bureau, should be referred for placement\nin an appropriate non-federal facility under contract with the\nBureau. Preparation of a transfer referral to merely \u201cexhaust\"\nall BOP resources is not required when the inmate is clearly\nnot appropriate for any facility within the Bureau. a.

Placement Procedures. The Warden will prepare a memorandum\nto the DSCC Administrator outlining the reasons for state\nplacement of a federal inmate. This memorandum will be forwarded\nalong with supporting documentation and classification material\nthat will, at a minimum, include the following:\n(1) Presentence Investigation Report;\n(2) Two copies of the Judgment;\n(3) Relevant SENTRY data;\n(4) Current Progress Report; and,\n(5) Any Disciplinary or SIS Reports. If the DSCC Administrator approves an inmate for state\nplacement, DSCC staff will select a state correctional\nsystem for referral. The system\nselected will be based on the type of facilities within the\nsystem; available bed space; court status (state systems that\nare under injunction because of overcrowding or violations of\ninmates' civil rights will not be used), and the state\u2019s\nwillingness to accept federal boarders. Once a suitable\nstate correctional system has been identified, DSCC staff will\nforward the transfer packet to the appropriate Community\nCorrections Regional Administrator, overseeing the state in\nwhich the DSCC Administrator has identified for possible\nplacement. DSCC staff may make up to two referrals per inmate at a time,\nand continue this process until an appropriate placement is\nsecured. The CCRA will work through the local CCM office which\nwill refer the case for state placement. The CCM office will\nadvise the CCRA of the response from the state\nauthority/Department of Corrections. If approved for\nplacement, the CCRA will initiate SENTRY redesignation\nprocedures, and forward the inmate file to the CCM office. If\nnot approved for placement the CCRA will P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 14\nadvise the DSCC Administrator, who will continue to secure a\nsuitable state placement. The CCM office with state monitoring authority in which the\ninmate is eventually housed assumes full responsibility for the\ninmate, including biennial reviews and subsequent transfer\nauthority. State placement materials containing, at a minimum, a\nProgress Report, Presentence Investigation Report, and all\nmemoranda pertaining to the state placement, will be forwarded\nto and maintained by the CCM office after the inmate has been\napproved for placement. If an inmate is approved for permanent return to the Bureau,\nthe place of confinement will be determined by the DSCC. If an\ninmate is returned to the Bureau for medical treatment, the\ninmate will be returned to the state when the medical\ntreatment is completed. Occasionally,\nreturning the inmate to the originating state may not be\nappropriate. In such cases, the DSCC will obtain a new place\nof incarceration for the inmate, after consultation with the\nOffice of Medical Designation and Transportation. b. Post-Placement Monitoring. After a federal inmate has been\nplaced in a state contract facility, the appropriate CCM will\nreview the case every two years beginning from the date of the\ninmate\u2019s arrival to determine whether the inmate is still\nappropriate for state placement. The CCM's cover memorandum\ncontaining a recommendation and a Progress Report provided by\nthe state contract facility will be forwarded to DSCC staff who\nwill make a determination for continued state placement or\nreturn to Bureau custody. If the inmate requires continued placement in that state\nfacility, DSCC staff will enter a notation on the SENTRY \u201cCIM\nClearance and Separatee Data\u201d screen indicating such.",

Inmates serving a sentence of Death will also be reviewed for\ncontinued state placement. Information received from Community\nCorrections staff during the review of the contract may be used\nto make a determination for continued state placement. The DSCC is responsible for monitoring and tracking state\nplacement requests received from BOP institutions. The CCRA will\nprepare a quarterly report (statistical/narrative) which will be\nforwarded to the DSCC Administrator. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 15\n19. SECONDARY DESIGNATION. Upon initial designation, an inmate\nmay be designated specifically for a parole hearing or program\nparticipation, and as a result, may require a secondary\ndesignation upon completion of the activity. If upon completion\nof the activity, staff determine that the secondary designation\nis no longer appropriate, the DSCC will be notified for\nreconsideration. Otherwise, when the conditions of the initial\ndesignation are met, institution staff will prepare a Transfer\nOrder for signature of the sending institution Warden and\narrangements will be made for movement of the inmate through\nroutine procedures. A secondary designation will not normally be made for cases\ndesignated for medical or psychiatric treatment. The medical\ncenter or reviewing institution will notify the Medical\nDesignator upon completion of evaluation or treatment. Approval\nwill be given for a secondary designation at that time. This\napproval will be based on medical requirements of the inmate\nand resources of the secondary designation. 20. POPULATION MANAGEMENT. The Assistant Director, Correctional\nPrograms Division periodically reviews each institution\u2019s Rated\nand Designation Capacities. Occasionally, it is necessary to\nimpose a moratorium or population cap on a particular\ninstitution to avoid or reduce overcrowding. The Assistant\nDirector, Correctional Programs Division, with the approval of\nthe Population Management Subcommittee of the Executive Staff,\nmay impose a moratorium on other facilities including the\nMedical Referral Center general population units. The Assistant\nDirector, Health Services Division, with the approval of the\nPopulation Management Subcommittee of the Executive Staff, may\nauthorize a moratorium or population cap for Medical Referral\nCenters (excluding general population). a. Referral Procedures (1) The Warden of the institution recommends to\nthe Regional Director that a moratorium or population\ncap be established. (2) The Regional Director reviews the request, and if\nin agreement, contacts the Assistant Director, Correctional\nPrograms Division, or the Assistant Director, Health\nServices Division, and either requests a population cap or\ntotal moratorium. A population cap places a ceiling on the number of inmates\nthat can be designated to a facility. A total moratorium is\ndefined as a complete cessation of all initial designations\nand redesignations to an institution or DFCL assignment. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 16 In extreme circumstances, the Assistant Director, Correctional\nPrograms or Health Services Division with concurrence of the\nSubcommittee may direct that inmates en route to a facility be\nredesignated. When a moratorium or population cap is imposed, a\ntermination date will be established. The cap or moratorium will\nbe terminated on that date unless the Regional Director contacts\nthe appropriate Assistant Director, Correctional Programs or\nHealth Services Division, and obtains an extension.",

INSTITUTIONS WITH SPECIAL MISSIONS a. FCI Oakdale. The Bureau, ICE, and the Executive Office for\nImmigration Review (EOIR) work closely together to meet the\nrequirements of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986,\nby ensuring the expeditious review of criminal aliens for\ndeportation. Beds are available for federally sentenced aliens,\nwho are subject to administrative proceedings under the\nImmigration and Naturalization Act. Such inmates are transferred\nto FCI Oakdale for disposition of their ICE detainer prior to\ncompletion of their federal sentence. Mexican and Cuban nationals are not eligible for the Oakdale\nCriminal Alien Program. The following procedures apply for the\nactual selection and designation of inmates to the Oakdale\nCriminal Alien Program. (1) The ICE Officer in Charge at FCI Oakdale will monitor\nthe inmate male population via SENTRY to identify criminal\naliens appropriate for the program at FCI Oakdale. After they\nhave been identified, ICE staff will place a detainer on these\nindividuals through the DSCC. Each week DSCC staff\nwill compile a list of the criminal aliens who are to be\nreleased within the next year. A courtesy list will be\nsubmitted, via GroupWise, to FCI Oakdale for monitoring\npurposes. (2) ICE staff at FCI Oakdale will forward to DSCC staff\ninformation on alien inmates via GroupWise to assist in the\nmovement of inmates to FCI Oakdale at a later date. The movement\nof inmates to FCI Oakdale will be authorized and coordinated by\nthe DSCC. DSCC staff will ensure CIM clearance is obtained and\nthe Custody Classification form reflects appropriate use of any\nManagement Variable. (3) Inmates will be redesignated no later than seven\nmonths from a firm projected release date. Once approved for\ntransfer, P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 17\ninstitution and transportation staff will immediately schedule\nthe inmate for movement to FCI Oakdale. Institution staff will\nnotify the Oakdale CMC if the inmate is not en route within 15\nworking days of the transfer approval. The central file should\ncontain a current Progress Report and all pertinent case\nmanagement activities should be completed prior to transfer\nincluding fines and the ordering of parole certificates, when\napplicable, or preparation of other release documents as\nrequired. (4) ISM staff will ensure any other detainers lodged\nagainst those inmates approved for transfer are resolved and\nthe detaining authority notified before the inmate is\ntransferred to FCI Oakdale. (5) Because of unforeseen circumstances, some criminal\naliens may be inappropriate for transfer to FCI Oakdale. ICE\nstaff at FCI Oakdale will notify DSCC staff when this occurs\nand will advise of any additional action necessary to\ncoordinate the resolution of the inmate's citizenship/release\nstatus. Conversely, institution staff are to contact DSCC staff\nif they believe a transfer should not occur. If the\ntransfer is deemed inappropriate, DSCC staff will delete the\nOakdale \"DST\" transfer approval.",

Any questions regarding\nthese matters should be directed to that office. b. USP Marion/ADX Florence. USP Marion/ADX Florence general\npopulation units are designed for male inmates who have\ndemonstrated an inability to function in a less restrictive\nenvironment without being a threat to others, or to the secure\nand orderly operation of the institution. (1) Referral Procedures and Criteria. Prior to referring\nan inmate to USP Marion or ADX Florence, redesignation to\nanother high security institution should be considered first. If transfer to another institution is not\nappropriate, Wardens will refer the proposed USP Marion or ADX\nFlorence case to North Central Regional Director. The North\nCentral Region will designate the inmate as appropriate. Assignment to USP Marion or ADX Florence will ordinarily be\nmade without regard for such factors as release destination or P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 18\nprogram needs, such as education and vocational training. Prior\nto transfer to USP Marion or ADX Florence, staff at the sending\ninstitution will ensure that the inmate is assigned Maximum\ncustody. While in transit to USP Marion or ADX Florence, inmates\nwill be housed and provided visiting, correspondence, and\ntelephone privileges as if confined at USP Marion or ADX\nFlorence. Inmates currently diagnosed as suffering from serious\npsychiatric illnesses should not be referred for placement at\neither USP Marion or ADX Florence. (2) Referral Packet for USP Marion or ADX Florence. The\nreferral packet for either USP Marion or ADX Florence general\npopulation will include the following items:\n(a) A memorandum from the Warden to the North\nCentral\nRegional\nDirector\nwith\nthe\nspecific\nrationale\nsupporting\nthe\ninstitution's\nrecommendation;\n(b) Copies of all disciplinary reports,\ninvestigative materials or other official documentation\nrelated to the behavior prompting the referral;\n(c) A current Progress Report; (d) A copy of the inmate's latest Presentence\nInvestigation Report; and,\n(e) A recent psychiatric or mental health evaluation. Inmates with severe or chronic behavior patterns that\ncannot be addressed in any other Bureau institution should be\nreferred to ADX Florence general population, and those who\nare somewhat less problematic should be referred to USP\nMarion. In describing the reasons underlying the referral, the\nWarden should explain why he or she has selected USP Marion\nor ADX Florence, respectively. (3) Acceptance or Rejection of Referrals. The North\nCentral Regional Director has final review authority for\nreferrals to the USP Marion and ADX Florence general\npopulation units. In some cases,\nthe Regional Director may approve placement at USP Marion\nwhen a referral has been submitted for ADX Florence and vice\nversa. A response to a recommendation for USP Marion or ADX\nFlorence placement will ordinarily be made by the North Central\nRegional Director within 60 calendar days after receiving the P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nChapter 7, Page 19\nreferral packet from the referring institution. Approval or\ndenial will be noted in SENTRY on the inmate's \u201cCIM\nClearance and Separatee Data\u201d screen, with a brief\nmemorandum from the North Central Regional Director to the\nrequesting Warden to follow.",

Upon the North Central Regional\nDirector\u2019s approval the request will be forwarded to the DSCC\nfor determination of an appropriate facility. Inmates will\nordinarily be transferred from USP Marion or ADX Florence using\nCode 308 - Lesser Security. Ordinarily, inmates completing the\nADX Florence program will be transferred to a High Security\nfacility, other than USP Marion. (5) USP Marion Failures. Inmates who continue to exhibit\ndisruptive misconduct at USP Marion may be considered for\nreferral to ADX Florence general population or the Control\nUnit.\nc. FMC Carswell Administrative Unit (1) Initial Designations. Initial designations may only\noccur in extraordinary situations by DSCC staff. (2) Redesignation Criteria.

Grower/Manufacturer: grows, cultivates, or manufactures a\ncontrolled substance, and is the principal owner of the drugs. (Keep in mind, the intent of this definition is to capture the\nindividual who has the capability to manufacture enormous\namounts of drugs in his garage/lab for example, and not the\nindividual who is growing only five marijuana plants in his\nbasement.) Financier/Money Launderer: provides money for\npurchase, importation, manufacture, cultivation,\ntransportation, or distribution of drugs; launders\nproceeds of drug sales or purchases. Aircraft Pilot/Vessel Captain: pilots vessel or aircraft;\nrequires special skill; does not include inmate who is the\nonly participant directing a small boat (i.e., a speed boat)\nonto which drugs had been loaded from a \u201cmother ship\u201d (such\nperson is a courier). P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nAppendix A, Page 6\nNOT A DRUG ORGANIZER/LEADER Manager: serves as a lieutenant to assist one of the above;\nmanages all or a significant portion of the manufacturing,\nimportation, or distribution operation; takes instructions\nfrom one of the above and conveys to subordinates; directly\nsupervises at least one other co-participant in an\norganization of at least five co-participants.

Chemists/Cooks/Chemical Supplier: produces LSD,\nmethamphetamine, crack cocaine, or other illegal drugs, but\ndoes not qualify as a Grower/Manufacturer because he/she is\nnot the principal owner of the drugs. Chemical supplier does\nnot handle drugs themselves but engages in the unlawful\ndiversion, sale, or furnishing of listed chemicals or\nequipment used in the synthesis or manufacturing of controlled\nsubstances. Supervisor: supervises at least one other co-participant,\nhowever, has limited authority and does not qualify as a\nManager. Street-Level Dealer: distributes retail quantities directly to\nthe user. Broker/Steerer/Go-Between: arranges for two parties to buy/sell\ndrugs, or directs potential buyer to a potential seller.

Off-loader/Loader: performs the physical labor required to put\nlarge quantities of drugs into storage, hiding, or onto some\nmode of transportation. Gopher/Lookout/Deckhand/Worker/Employee: performs very limited,\nlow-level function in the offense (whether or not ongoing);\nincludes running errands, answering the telephone, receiving\npackages, packaging the drugs, manual labor, acting as lookout\nto provide early warnings during meetings, exchanges, or offloading, or acting as deckhand/crew member on vessel or\naircraft used to transport large quantities of drugs. Enabler (Passive): plays no more than a passive role in the\noffense, knowingly permitting a certain unlawful criminal\nactivity to take place without actually being involved with\nthe activity; may be coerced or unduly influenced to play such\na function (e.g., a parent or grandparent threatened with\ndisplacement from a home unless they permit the activity to\ntake place), or may do so as \u201ca favor\u201d (without compensation). User Only: possessed small amount of drugs apparently for\npersonal use only; no apparent function in any conspiratorial\ncriminal activity. Wholesaler: sells more than retail/user-level\nquantities (greater than one ounce) in a single\ntransaction. P5100.08\n9/12/2006\nAppendix A, Page 8 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS In the case of an offense involving marijuana plants, one plant\nequals 100 grams (or the actual weight of the useable\nmarijuana, whichever is greater). If the offense includes several types of drugs, compute the\nmarijuana equivalent and total the sum to arrive at a grand\ntotal. For example, if the inmate has marijuana, cocaine, and\nheroin, compute the cocaine and heroin to an equivalent\namount of marijuana and hold the inmate accountable for the\nsum total of the equivalent amount of marijuana. Offenses not listed will be assigned a severity category\naccording to the most comparable listed offense. Score any attempt, aiding and abetting, conspiracy, misprision\nof a felony, and accessory after the fact in the same severity\ncategory as the underlying offense. Total offense behavior is to\nbe considered, utilizing the most serious offense or act\ncommitted. However, in drug conspiracy cases, the individual\nwill be held accountable as documented by the Judge in the\nStatement of Reasons. If the Statement of Reasons is not\nattached, the Case Manager will review the Presentence\nInvestigation Report to determine the individual\u2019s specific\nreported behavior, and not hold the individual accountable for\nthe entire drug conspiracy empire. If committed as a parole, mandatory release, special parole\nterm, or supervised release violator as a result of a new\nconviction, use that new offense behavior for scoring\n\"Severity of Current Offense.\" If committed as a probation violator, use the most severe\ndocumented behavior between the original offense that\nprompted probation and the new criminal conduct (violation\nbehavior) for scoring \"Severity of Current Offense.\" For this Program Statement\u2019s purposes, sentences with a\nspecific finding of \u201cwithheld adjudication\u201d will be considered\nthe same as if the Judge made a finding of guilt.
