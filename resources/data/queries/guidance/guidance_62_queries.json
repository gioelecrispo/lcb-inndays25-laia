As used throughout this guide, the term \u201cnon-Federal entity(ies)\u201d includes for-profit entities. This guide is based on the Procurement Standards set out at 2 C.F.R. Sections 200.317 through\n200.326 and given regulatory effect by way of 2 C.F.R. Part 2800, Uniform Administrative\nRequirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards by the Department\nof Justice (hereafter, the \u201cPart 200 Uniform Requirements\u201d). This document should be used in\nconjunction with the DOJ Grants Financial Guide as a tool to assist DOJ recipients and\nsubrecipients in conducting procurements of property or services under DOJ grants or\ncooperative agreements that conform to the procurement standards and other applicable law. Page | 4 Chapter 1\nGeneral Principles This \u201cGuide to Procurements under DOJ Grants and Cooperative Agreements\u201d is intended to be\nused by States and other non-Federal entities. States (including their agencies and instrumentalities thereof) must follow the same policies\nand procedures they use for procurements from their non-Federal funds. See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\n200.317. In addition, States must comply with the requirements set out at 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.322 for\nprocurements of recovered materials and must ensure that procurement contracts funded\nwith DOJ grant or cooperative agreement funds contain any clauses required by 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\n200.326. All other non-Federal entities (including, for purposes of this guide, for-profit entities),\nincluding subrecipients of a State, must follow 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.318 through \u00a7 200.326.",

All non-Federal entities should be aware that any disbursement of Federal program funds to\nanother party may cast that party as either a subrecipient or a contractor. For guidance on\nsubrecipient and contractor determinations, see 2. C.F.R. \u00a7 200.330. This guide deals with\nprocurement (i.e. contracts) under grants and not with subawards to subrecipients. Under the\nPart 200 Uniform Requirements, a contractor is an entity that receives a contract, which is\ndefined as a legal instrument by which a non-Federal entity purchases property or services\nneeded to carry out the project or program under a Federal award (2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.22, 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\n200.23). A subaward in contrast is an award provided by a Non-Federal entity to a subrecipient\nso that the subrecipient can carry out a part of the Federal award (2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.92). Whether\nthe agreement is a subaward or a contract will be determined by the substance of the\nrelationship, regardless of whether the parties consider the agreement to be a contract. When conducting procurements under Federal grant and cooperative agreement awards, a\nNon-Federal entity must establish and maintain written procurement policies and procedures\nthat reflect any applicable State, tribal, or local laws and regulations. These procurements must\nalso conform to applicable Federal law, including the Part 200 Uniform Requirements. Finally, those engaged in construction activities funded under federal grants and cooperative\nagreements should be aware that special rules may apply to their activities. See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\n200.325. Page | 5 Chapter 2\nEvolution of a Requirement\nA grant or cooperative agreement application may incorporate the prospective non-Federal\nentity contracting parts of a project, such as when equipment or materials are required in order\nto carry out the project funded under the Federal award. The preliminary decision to contract is based upon the prospective recipient\u2019s best knowledge\nof the project requirements. Front-end logistical planning is necessary to conclude how best to\nmeet the requirement. Dollar estimates for contracting efforts should be determined first, and\nthen later included in the grant application. The non-Federal entity should consider the most economical approach to the acquisition,\nincluding whether a procurement contract is the best option for meeting a project requirement. Multiple options may be available, depending on the goods and services required. Each should\nbe considered in light of the Part 200 Uniform Requirements\u2019 emphasis upon greater economy,\nefficiency, and avoiding any duplication of effort. 200 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.318(d). No. Question\n1. Yes No Is it more economical to lease the requirement rather than purchase\nit? If the answer is \u201cYes\u201d, consider leasing rather than purchasing. See\nChapter 18 \u201cOther Considerations\u201d of this guide. 2. Is the requirement for common or shared goods or services? If the answer is \u201cYes\u201d, consider using a State or local\nintergovernmental agreement, or an inter-entity agreement. 3. Does the requirement allow for used equipment or property as\nopposed to new? If the answer is \u201cYes\u201d, consider using Federal excess or surplus\nproperty. Page | 6",

Page | 6 Chapter 3\nAcquisition Planning/Developing the Procurement Package\nDetailed in-house planning is necessary in order to effectively award a contract. Who will be\nresponsible for overseeing and interacting on different aspects of the contract should be\ndetermined in advance of any procurement. Therefore, there should be an agreement among\npersonnel concerning details of any proposed contract well in advance of performance on the\ncontract taking place. If competitive sealed bidding is to be used, the contract is to be awarded on a fixed-price basis\nto the lowest responsible and responsive bidder. The procuring agency\u2019s invitation for bids\nshould include a complete, clear, accurate, and realistic specification or purchase description\n(including any necessary design specifications). If a negotiated procurement approach is to be used to obtain the goods or services, the\nsolicitation\u2019s Statement of Work (SOW) should incorporate a clear and accurate description of\nthe technical requirements. The request for proposals also must identify all evaluation factors\nand their relative importance. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the\ntechnical requirements, a \u201cbrand name or equivalent\u201d description may be used instead. The\nsolicitation must clearly state any specific features of any named brand that offerors must\naddress in an offer in order to meet requirements under the procurement. 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\n200.319(c)(1). The checklist below lists the types of documents that should be completely developed before\nthe procurement action begins. Pre-Procurement Documentation Requirements:\n\uf0fc Requisition. \uf0fc SOW (negotiated procurement) or Invitation for Bids (competitive, sealed bidding)\n(include design specifications, if applicable). \uf0fc Evaluation Criteria (negotiated procurement). \uf0fc Justification for noncompetitive procurement (sole source contracting). See Chapter 10 Procurement by Noncompetitive Proposals.\n\uf0fc All concurrences that may be required. Page | 7 Contracting Planning Procedures Checklist\nNo. Question 1. Are grant or cooperative agreement funds available to fund\nthe proposed procurement? 2. Has a market survey been conducted and documented to\ndetermine if there are contractors available to satisfy the\nrequirement? 3. Have divisions of labor been identified regarding contractual\nobligations for administrative, technical, and overall project\nresponsibility? 4. What type of procurement method has been chosen? Yes No Micro-purchases\nSmall Purchases\nCompetitive Sealed Bidding\nCompetitive Proposal (Negotiated Procurement)\nProcurement by Noncompetitive Proposals\n5.

As an example, if the product or service is available from\nanother government agency or department, it may be appropriate to enter into a state, local,\nor tribal intergovernmental (or intra-governmental) or inter-entity agreement. Such\nagreements, under appropriate circumstances, may provide more economical, cost-effective,\nand efficient ways to obtain or use common or shared goods or services. If acquisition planning\nand research indicate that a procurement contract is the most cost-effective approach to\nmeeting a particular requirement, then the procuring entity needs to apply its procurement\nprocedures and policies \u2013 and the Procurement Standards in the Part 200 Uniform\nRequirements \u2013 to help identify the appropriate procurement method and its requirements. For purchases below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, procurement by micro-purchase or\nby small purchase procedures may be used. Where the contract value costs more than the Simplified Acquisition threshold, the main types\nof procurement are procurement by competitive proposals (Competitive Negotiation) and\nprocurement by sealed bid (Competitive Sealed Bidding). The sealed bid method is the\npreferred method for procuring construction if the following conditions apply:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available; More than one responsible bidder is willing and able to compete effectively,\nand\nThe procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of\ncontractor can be made principally on the basis of price. Procurement by competitive proposals is generally used when conditions are not appropriate\nfor the use of sealed bids. Procurement by Noncompetitive Proposal is used in limited circumstances, see Chapter 10. Page | 9 Chapter 5\nCompetition All procurement transactions must be conducted in a manner that provides for\nfull and open competition, consistent with the procurement standards. 1 All non-Federal entities should have written procedures for procurement transactions. These\nprocedures must ensure that all solicitations incorporate clear and accurate descriptions of the\ntechnical requirements for the goods or services being procured. This description should not,\nhowever, in competitive solicitations, unduly restrict competition. In order to preserve full and open competition, contractors that develop or draft statements of\nwork, requirements, specifications, or invitations for bids or requests for proposals must be\nexcluded from competing for those procurements. Further, undue restrictions on full and open\ncompetition must be avoided, such as:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 Making unreasonable requirements in order to qualify for competition;\nRequiring unnecessary experience or excessive bonding; Engaging in noncompetitive practices between firms or in noncompetitive contracts\nwith consultants on retainer;\nOrganizational conflicts of interest;\nSpecifying a \u201cbrand name\u201d product without provision for an equivalent product to be\noffered (and without performance requirements or features being clearly described in\nprocurement documents), or\nAny arbitrary action in the procurement process. The SOW (or Invitation for Bids) itself should encourage such full and open competition.",

      "content": "The SOW (or Invitation for Bids) itself should encourage such full and open competition. Bidders\u2019 lists or market surveys can be used to help determine whether there will be a sufficient\nnumber of prospective offerors or bidders for a full and open competition to take place. If a\nbidders list is not considered adequate with respect to a requirement, a market survey of the\nmarketplace should be conducted. Advertising the requirements in local newspapers and trade\npublications is one way to achieve a more effective, full and open competition. Recommendations and prohibitions regarding how to make these competitions as full and open\nas possible are examined in detail at 2 CFR \u00a7 200.319. 1 Part 200 Uniform Requirements 2 CFR \u00a7 200.319. Page | 10 Some organizations choose to maintain a prequalified bidders list, i.e., a list of prospective\nbidders who are prequalified as to material, equipment, or services. However, if not\nadministered properly, this prequalification may run counter to the goal of full and open\ncompetition. Accordingly, prequalified bidders lists may be used only if they are current and\ninclude enough qualified sources to ensure adequate competition. If a pattern of \u201cno response\u201d\nis indicated for one or more bidders, organizations should consider whether removal of such\nbidder(s) from a bidders list may be justifiable and appropriate. Also, maintaining these lists by\nfunctional category may make them easier to use and maintain. If bidders\u2019 lists are used,\nprospective bidders must not be precluded from becoming qualified during the solicitation\nperiod. 2\nLocal preference laws/ordinances have always required special attention by the grantor agency\nwhen there are Federal dollars involved. Therefore, the non-Federal entity must conduct\nprocurements in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed\nstate, local, or tribal geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except\nwhere expressly encouraged by applicable Federal law. 3 Competition Checklist\nNo. Question 1. Does the SOW (or Invitation for Bids) contain attributes\nconducive to a full and open competition?\u201d Yes No If the answer is \u201cNo,\u201d the restrictive parts should be\nrewritten. 2. Has the bidders list or a market survey been reviewed to\ndetermine availability of competitive contractors? If the answer is \u201cNo,\u201d a review should be done to determine\nthe availability of competitive contractors in the market\nplace. 3. Has an \u201cadvertising\u201d strategy been developed to allow\nprospective bidders ample time to request a copy of the\ninvitation for bids and respond accordingly? If the answer is \u201cNo,\u201d ample time for advertising should be\nfactored in, when determining the forecasted award date. 2\n3 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200. 319(d).\n2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.319(b).

The use of shared or common services arrangements or other agreements between or among\nagencies may offer certain advantages. For example, valuable procurement lead-time (or costs)\nmay be saved. In addition, the preparation of a SOW, as well as the requirements for invitations\nfor bids or requests for proposals, may become unnecessary under certain circumstances.

Yes No If the answer is \u201cYes\u201d, an intergovernmental (or intragovernmental) or inter-entity agreement may be explored in\norder to help satisfy your agency\u2019s requirement. Page | 13 Chapter 7\nSmall Purchases (and Micro-Purchases) Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement\nmethods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more\nthan the Simplified Acquisition Threshold [(currently set at $150,000)]. 4\nProcurement by micro-purchase is the acquisition of supplies or services, the aggregate dollar\namount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (currently set at $3,500). 5 This method is an important part of the logistics support function. Simplified procedures to cut\ndown procurement lead time for day-to-day support items should be used. Simplified\nprocedures may include the following:\n1. Telephone or Electronic Solicitations (normally for local vendors). Price quotes are\nreceived by telephone or electronically. Where the purchase is anticipated to exceed\nthe micro-purchase threshold, at least three (3) vendors should be solicited and price,\navailability, delivery, etc., should be\nrequested.

Depending upon threshold 4 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.320(b). The Simplified Acquisition Threshold is set by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The\nFAR currently sets the Simplified Acquisition Threshold at $150,000, though it is periodically adjusted for inflation\nin accordance with 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 1908. See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.88.\n5\n2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.320(a). The Part 200 Uniform Requirements defines \u201cMicro-purchase\u201d at 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.67. The\nMicro-purchase threshold is set by the FAR. The FAR currently sets the Micro-purchase threshold at $3,500, subject\nto certain exceptions. 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.101. Page | 14 limits established under non-Federal entity procurement rules, purchase cards (or,\ncredit cards) may sometimes be used for these transactions. Non-Federal entities\nshould have documented procedures that include control limits, authorized users and\napproving officials. Orders are placed against the BPA and the agreed-to-discount is\nincluded on the resulting invoice. Normally, billings are made by the vendor on a\nmonthly basis. Caution should be taken to ensure discipline in assigning authority to\npurchase, including through the use of purchase cards. Orders should be placed to\nsatisfy only legitimate requirements. 4. Imprest Fund (Petty Cash Fund). Paying cash for small dollar purchases is a viable way\nto accommodate small dollar requirements. There is only one overriding prerequisite for\nsuccessful operation of the fund: Strict Dollar Accountability. Only designated personnel\nshould be given safe access and combination numbers. Any change in designated\npersonnel should require a change in the safe combination. Cash advances may be\nmade and reconciled with a paid invoice at the completion of the purchase. Documented policy and procedures are needed including approving officials and\nperiodic audits of the fund. Micro-purchases (defined at 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.67) may be awarded without soliciting competitive\nquotations if the non-Federal entity considers the price to be reasonable. To the extent\npracticable, micro-purchases should be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers. When seeking to use either small purchase or micro-purchase methods, procuring agencies\nmust avoid the intentional \u201csplitting\u201d of purchases or transactions to circumvent the dollar\nthreshold limitations. Periodic internal review of buying patterns that focuses on repetitive\ntransactions would be a good approach to address this potential issue. A repetitive buying\npattern for a good or service without auditable evidence of a strong business case or\nprogrammatic reason to support the awarding of multiple contracts under small- or micropurchase thresholds at frequent intervals may indicate that inappropriate purchase splitting has\noccurred.

The requirement can be described and is finite and specific in detail, i.e., no unknowns\nor no contingencies. The contract will be awarded to the\na. lowest (fixed price) (where specified in bidding documents certain factors such\nas discounts, transportation costs, and life cycle costs must be considered in\ndetermining which bid is lowest),\nb. responsive (the bid meets all the requirements of the invitation for bids,\nincluding design specifications), and\nc. responsible bidder (the contractor has the capability in all respects, including\ntechnical and financial). 2. There are two or more contractors that could satisfy the requirement and are willing\nand able to compete for the contract. 3. There is enough time available to issue the invitation for bids, conduct a public bid\nopening, and award a firm fixed-price contract to the lowest responsive and responsible\nbidder. If sealed bids are used, bids must be solicited to an adequate number of known suppliers,\nproviding them with a sufficient amount of time to respond. Under the sealed bidding method\nof procurement, it is not necessary to conduct discussions with bidders in order to obtain the\ngreatest value for the procuring agency, as the award is to be made to the lowest responsive\nand responsible bidder. For local and tribal governments, the invitation for bids must be\npublically advertised. However, if a procurement could be of the type that it may need to involve negotiation with\nvendors or discussions in order for the procuring agency to obtain the best value based on the\nrequirement, it may be the case that competitive sealed bidding is not the right approach and\nthe competitive proposals procurement method should be used instead. 6",

Is it possible to describe the requirement in exact terms (e.g.,\ndesign specifications) so the contractor can make a fixed\nprice bid? Yes No (Note: If a contractor must provide a deliverable for a fixed\nprice where \u201cunknowns\u201d are involved, contingency dollars\nusually are included in the price. Then, if these contingencies\ndo not generate or occur, the material/service may be\noverpriced.) If the answer is \u201cYes,\u201d an Invitation for Bid (IFB) may be\neffectively used and the award can be made to the lowest\nbidder that is responsive and responsible. 2. Can it be expected that \u201cadvertising\u201d will result in two or\nmore responses to the solicitation? If the answer is \u201cYes,\u201d consider use of an IFB. Page | 18 Chapter 9\nCompetitive Proposals (Negotiated Procurement)\nProcurement by competitive proposals. The technique of competitive proposals is\nnormally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, and either a\nfixed price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. It is generally used\nwhen conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. 7\nProcedures involve the following:\n1. Develop a Statement of Work (SOW) listing essential requirements to accomplish the\ncontract. For instance, in the case of a desired service, the SOW should spell out the\nparticular problem to be solved including any essential requirement, without needlessly\nmandating the approach the contractor must take unless required by law. The SOW\nshould be written in a straightforward manner, and, as a minimum, should contain the\nfollowing:\na. Background providing necessary introductory information or evolution of the\nrequirement. b. Objectives/scope of work detailing broad parameters that are essential to\neffectively satisfy the requirement. (Note: Do not needlessly mandate how the\ncontractor should satisfy the objectives of the contract. Performance measures\nmust be used to ensure the quality of the outputs/outcomes.)\nc. A list of tasks with accompanying deliverables, organized in a logical sequence. d. A delivery schedule in increments as required to satisfy the requirement. The\nschedule may include performance bonuses for early completion and penalties\nfor late delivery. e. Acceptance and approval procedures should be indicated. f. Other coverage as may be required:\ni. References, licensing, and professional certifications. ii. Non-Federal entity furnished items. iii. Packing and shipping. iv. Any other points that require coverage. 2. Develop the Request for Proposals (RFP) to identify all evaluation factors and their\nrelative importance. 7 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.320(d). Page | 19 3. The RFP normally will contain the following:\na. Letter of Transmittal (or local standard form) providing certain relevant details\nconcerning the requirement. b. A delivery schedule to be included in the definitive contract, including all\nnecessary administrative details. c. The SOW (see no. 1 on the previous page). d. Required special and mandatory clauses (Reference: Contract Provisions,\nChapter 11). e. Any special instructions to offerors to assist in developing the offer. f. A listing of evaluation criteria to be used by the non-Federal entity in the\nevaluation of the offers received. Percentage weights may be assessed each\ncriterion or the order of importance of each indicated criterion may be shown. g.",

Page | 24 Chapter 11\nContract Provisions The Part 200 Uniform Requirements require that non-Federal entities\u2019 contracts contain the\napplicable provisions described in Appendix II to Part 200 \u2014\u201cContract Provisions for NonFederal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards.\u201d 9 Non-Federal entities may develop language\nsuited to accommodate a specific contractual situation, providing such clauses are consistent\nwith the procurement standards and other applicable law. Non-Federal entities should be\naware that they bear full responsibility for the settlement of all contractual and administrative\nissues arising out of their procurements, and that the Federal awarding agency will not\nsubstitute its judgment for that of the non-Federal entity unless the matter is primarily a\nFederal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the proper authority in the applicable\njurisdiction.10 A discussion of a few of these provisions is set forth below:\n1. Contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently set at $150,000)\nmust address administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where the\ncontractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and\npenalties as appropriate. Reference: Part 200 Appendix II(A). 2. Termination. Any contract over $10,000 must address termination for cause and\ntermination for convenience by the non-Federal entity, including the manner by which it\nwill be effected and the basis for settlement. a. Termination for Convenience. Contract is terminated due to reasons known to\nthe non-Federal entity, i.e., program changes, changes in state-of-the-art\nequipment or technology, insufficient funding, etc. This type of termination is\nutilized when the contractor is not in violation of the contract terms and\nconditions. b. Termination for Cause. Contract is terminated due to actions by the contractor,\ni.e., failure to perform, financial difficulty, slipped schedules, etc. In certain\ninstances, termination settlement may include reprocurement costs to be paid\nby the contractor. Termination settlements shall be accommodated by negotiations carefully planned in\norder to achieve an equitable resolution.

Contracts awarded for construction (generally DOJ grants do not allow\nconstruction) have special requirements and clauses. Refer to the DOJ Grants Financial\nGuide in the procurement chapter for specifications. If you have a DOJ grant allowing\nconstruction costs, please read the associated solicitation, award documents, and\nspecial conditions carefully. Regular contact with your program manager is very\nimportant.

Per Section 6002, where the purchase price of\nthe item exceeds $10,000 or the value of the quantity acquired during the preceding\nfiscal year exceeded $10,000, these non-Federal entities and their contractors must\nprocure only items, designated in guidelines of the EPA at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 247, containing the\nhighest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent with maintaining a\nsatisfactory level of competition. These non-Federal entities and their contractors must\nprocure solid waste management services so that energy and resource recovery are\nmaximized, and they must establish an affirmative procurement program for\nprocurement of recovered materials identified in the EPA guidelines. Reference: Part 200 Appendix II(J), 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.322. Page | 27 Chapter 12\nContract Type Selection The following is a list of various contract types. Contract Type can refer both to\nthe overall structure of a contract (e.g. task or delivery order) and the pricing\nstructure of a contract (fixed price vs. cost reimbursement). Determining which\ncontract type to use is important to ensure cost-effectiveness and performance. Pricing Structure: The non-Federal entity must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with\nevery procurement action (including modifications) in excess of the Simplified\nAcquisition Threshold. The exact method and degree of analysis will vary\ndepending on the exact circumstances and facts of a particular procurement\nsituation, but the non-Federal entity must, as a starting point, make independent\nestimates before receiving bids or proposals. 11\n1. Fixed Price. All contracts awarded under a competitive sealed bidding result in some\ntype of \"fixed price\" arrangement, normally a firm fixed price. Fixed price contracts may\nalso be awarded under other contracting methods such as negotiation/competitive\nproposals, for instance, where the use of sealed bidding would be inappropriate\nbecause discussions with the contractor are deemed necessary. Fixed price contracts\nhave the advantage that the risk rests with the contractor. Firm fixed price contracts\nmay be appropriate when:\na.

Cost Reimbursement. Under cost\ncost reimbursement contracts to\nreimbursement contracts, contractors are\navoid unneeded cost over-runs. paid both the allowable incurred cost (i.e.,\nallowable actual expenses) and a\npredetermined fee or profit. Contractors should be reimbursed for their actual\nexpenditures (no accruals may be reimbursed) no more often than bi-weekly. Normally,\ncontractors are reimbursed in monthly increments. Some procuring organizations\n11 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.323. Page | 28 permit withholding of a small percentage of each reimbursement request to ensure final\ndelivery and contract close-out. Inasmuch as contractors are incrementally reimbursed\nas the contract progresses, the risk to the contractor is minimized. The most common type of cost reimbursement contract is the cost plus fixed fee (CPFF). In this type of contract the fee (on fixed price contracts it is defined as profit) is\nnegotiated front-end and does not change. On cost reimbursement contracts, a ceiling is\nplaced on the estimated cost. Even though additional dollars may be added under\ncertain conditions, the fee does not change as long as the contract remains in-scope. Any contractual situation that automatically increases the fee when additional dollars\nare added is known as \"cost plus percentage of cost\" and is prohibited. 12 Other types of\ncost reimbursement contracts are:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Cost contracts. Cost sharing contracts. Cost plus incentive fee contracts. Time and materials contracts.

These contracts may\nbe used only after a\ndetermination that no other contract type is suitable, and only if the contract\nincludes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. 13 Overall Structure:\n1. Task and delivery order contracts are used when exact time of delivery or the exact\namount needed is unknown. Indefinite delivery contracts may be \u201cindefinite\ndelivery/indefinite quantity\u201d (ID/IQ) or \u201cindefinite delivery/definite quanity\u201d (ID/DQ). If\nthe exact amount needed is not known, the contract may include a guaranteed\nminimum in the case of an ID/IQ or a promise not to order from others in the case of a\nrequirements contract. 2.

Page | 34 Chapter 13\nCode of Conduct The non-Federal entity must maintain written standards of conduct covering\nconflict of interest and governing the actions of its employees engaged in the\nselection, award, and administration of contracts. The standards of conduct must\nprovide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations by officers, employees,\nor agents of the non-Federal entity. 14\nNo employee, officer, or agent of the non-Federal entity shall participate in selection, award, or\nadministration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or\napparent, would be involved (DOJ strictly applies this standard). Such a conflict would arise\nwhen:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 The employee, officer or agent, or\nAny member of his/her immediate family, or\nHis or her partner, or\nAny organization which employs, or is about to employ, has a financial or other interest\nin or receives or stands to receive a tangible personal benefit from a firm being\nconsidered for a contract. Non-Federal entity personnel involved in the procurement process must be ever alert for\nsituations that may create a real, or even apparent, conflict of interest. Common sense and\nadherence to standards and codes of conduct will go a long way toward eliminating potential\nproblems. Non-Federal entity personnel should additionally:\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 14 Be familiar with any code of ethics guidance published by or available to their\norganization. Neither solicit nor accept gifts, favors, gratuities, or anything of monetary value from\ncontractors or parties to subcontracts. In this connection, non-Federal entities may set\nstandards to address situations where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift\nis an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. Avoid, at all times, even the appearance of a conflict of interest. Ensure that proposal evaluators (price and technical) or members of their immediate\nfamilies do not own stock or have other financial interest in the companies being\nevaluated. 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.318(c). Page | 35 \u2022 Refer any problem that arises concerning conflict of interest to upper management and\nlegal counsel, as appropriate.

Yes No If the answer is \u201cYes,\u201d the non-Federal entity\u2019s top\nmanagement, in concert with legal counsel, should\ndetermine the severity of the problem and enforce sanctions\nand notify proper authorities. 2. Is there any indication the SOW might be restrictive? If the answer is \u201cYes,\u201d the SOW must be corrected and the\nRFP amended or canceled, as appropriate. 3. Have there been any protests or hints of improprieties from\nany outside sources? If the answer is \u201cYes,\u201d the validity must be determined and\naction taken accordingly. 4. Has there been an appearance of conflicts of interest relating\nto the proposed contractual action?

Page | 37 Chapter 14\nPrice and Cost Analysis The non-Federal entity must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with\nevery procurement action in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold\nincluding contract modifications. 16\nPrice Analysis involves a comparison of the bottom line price quoted by the offeror with prices\npaid on other contracts for the same or similar materials or services; a review of trade publications for comparability; a comparison of prices quoted by other respondents to the solicitation\n(does not apply to sole source contracts); and any other comparison available to the nonFederal entity. The purpose of price analysis is to determine that the price quoted is within\nrange of acceptability to the non-Federal entity. Cost Analysis involves an analysis of the individual elements of cost (as requested by the\nsolicitation) as stated in the contractor's cost proposal. Examples of individual elements of cost\ninclude direct labor, fringe benefits, overhead (indirect costs), materials, travel, subcontracts,\netc. Questionable individual elements of cost become negotiation targets for the non-Federal\nentity during the subsequent negotiation with the contractor. Price and Cost Analysis are required for all proposals submitted by offerors for evaluation and\nnegotiation by the non-Federal entity.",

Non-Federal entities should compare graphically each contractor's cost proposal using\nspreadsheets. However, keep in mind that accounting systems differ between contractors and\nexact dollar comparison between individual cost elements may not constitute a valid\ncomparison. For example, one contractor may charge a certain expense item to overhead\n(indirect costs), whereas another contractor may charge an identical expense item as a \"direct\"\ncharge to the contract. Price Analysis and Cost Analysis are normally used in concert with each other. Each should\nsupport the other.

If the answer is \u201cYes,\u201d determine when audit was completed\nand whether the overhead (indirect cost) rate can be\ncategorized as current. If the answer is \u201cNo,\u201d determine on what basis the overhead\n(indirect cost) rate was calculated and then validate\nacceptability. 3. Was a spreadsheet used to show graphically a comparison of\nthe elements of cost? Even though a spreadsheet is not mandatory, its use is highly\nrecommended. 4. Were individual results from cost analysis used to determine\nnegotiation cost targets? Remember the proposal is the contractor\u2019s. Justification is\nrequired for any element of cost questioned by the nonFederal entities. 5. If possible, non-Federal entities should adhere to maximum\nFederal fee limitations under cost reimbursement\narrangements, i.e., 10% on estimated cost, 15% of the\nestimated cost on Research and Development, and 6% of the\nestimated cost of Construction or Architectural Engineering.

Page | 43 Chapter 17\nContract Administration\nNon-Federal entities will maintain a contract administration system which ensures\nthat contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and\nspecifications of their contracts or purchase orders. 19\nContract administration refers to post award actions by the non-Federal entity to ensure that\nthe terms and conditions of the contract are met. It takes continual vigilance on the part of the\nnon-Federal entity to ensure that contract deliverables are met to accommodate mandated\nproject requirements. A non-Federal entity will follow the same procedures for procuring\nproperty and services under a grant as it uses for its non-Federal funds. Other non-Federal\nentities should follow procedures outlined in this guideline. 1. Delegations. Non-Federal entity management shall delegate administration\nresponsibility to designated personnel selected for their technical and administrative\ncapability to administer the contract effectively. Any disagreement between technical\nand administrative personnel shall be referred to top level non-Federal entity\nmanagement for resolution. 2. Inspection and Acceptance. Contractor deliverables shall be inspected before official\nacceptance by the non-Federal entity to ensure that contract requirements are met. Acceptance shall be made officially only after the non-Federal entity determines that\ncontract terms and conditions have been met. 3. Progress Reports. Under cost reimbursement contracts, progress/status reports are\nrequired normally by the SOW. These reports shall be reviewed by the non-Federal\nentity to determine if contract delivery milestones are being met, and, if they are not,\nthe seriousness of the delinquency should be analyzed and, if appropriate, corrective\naction taken. 4. Invoice Processing. Under cost reimbursement contracts, reimbursement invoices are\nsubmitted normally by the contractor on a monthly basis. However, in the case of a\nsmall or disadvantaged contractor, invoices may be submitted every two weeks. There\nmust be a correlation between dollars paid incrementally to the contractor and contract\nprogress in consonance with an acceptable tolerance level that is established. Invoices\nshould be processed as expeditiously as possible with dollar hold-backs (to be paid after\ncompletion/final acceptance) considered in determining the net amount of the\nincremental dollar reimbursement. 19 2 C.F.R. 200.318(b). Page | 44 5. Consent to Subcontract. Non-Federal entities shall establish procedures to review and\ngive prior consent for subcontracts awarded by a prime contractor(s). Monetary consent\nlevels may be established at the discretion of the non-Federal entity. 6. Non-Federal entity Contract Close-out. Non-Federal entity contract close-out is an\nimportant function of contract administration and may be characterized logically as the\nlast of the many functions related to contract administration.

Lease vs. Purchase Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase\nalternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most\neconomical approach. 20\nBefore entering into a leasing arrangement for equipment or purchasing equipment, a leasepurchase analysis should be performed by the non-Federal entity to determine economic\nfeasibility. This analysis should reflect a comparison of forecasted costs for both an outright\npurchase and a leasing arrangement.

These records will include, but are necessarily limited\nto the following: rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract\ntype, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price. 21 It is extremely important that non-Federal entities document contractual actions in order to\nformulate and maintain an audit trail. The official contract file should reflect in detail all of the\nsteps in the procurement process and serves as the official accountability document. 3. Other Resources 22\nNon-Federal entities are encouraged to use other resources such as donated property\nand Federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and\nproperty whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs. 20 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.318(d).\n2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.318(i).\n22\n2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.318(f).\n21 Page | 49 4. Use of Value Engineering 23\nNon-Federal entities are encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for\nconstruction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure\nthat its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost. 23 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.318(g).

Contracting Practices to Employ\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\ne. Ensure adequate competition. Prepare Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP). Maintain bidders list(s). Conduct interviews (for RFP). Obtain prior approval (where required). 2. Contracting Practices to Avoid\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\ne.\nf. Place unreasonable requirements. Require unnecessary experience. Engage in noncompetitive pricing. Engage in organizational conflicts-of-interest. Engage in wasteful or needlessly duplicative spending. Require unreasonable timeframes. Page | 51",
