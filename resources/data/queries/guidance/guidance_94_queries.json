An inmate who is pregnant should not be placed in restraints unless there are reasonable grounds\nto believe the inmate presents an immediate, serious threat of hurting herself, staff, or others, or\nthat she presents an immediate credible risk of escape that cannot be reasonably contained\nthrough other methods. For additional guidance refer to Section 13. U.S. Department of Justice\nFederal Bureau of Prisons Program\nStatement OPI:\nNUMBER:\nDATE:\nSUBJECT: CPD/CSB\nP5566.06\n11/30/2005\nUse of Force and\nApplication of\nRestraints 1. [PURPOSE AND SCOPE \u00a7552.20. The Bureau of Prisons authorizes\nstaff to use force only as a last alternative after all other\nreasonable efforts to resolve a situation have failed. When\nauthorized, staff must use only that amount of force necessary to\ngain control of the inmate, to protect and ensure the safety of\ninmates, staff and others, to prevent serious property damage,\nand to ensure institution security and good order. Staff are\nauthorized to apply physical restraints necessary to gain control\nof an inmate who appears to be dangerous because the inmate:\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\ne. Assaults another individual;\nDestroys government property;\nAttempts suicide;\nInflicts injury upon self; or\nBecomes violent or displays signs of imminent violence. This rule on application of restraints does not restrict the use\nof restraints in situations requiring precautionary restraints,\nparticularly in the movement or transfer of inmates (e.g., the\nuse of handcuffs in moving inmates to and from a cell in\ndetention, escorting an inmate to a Special Housing Unit pending\ninvestigation, etc.).] Under this rule precautionary restraints may also be used as\nprescribed by medical staff for medical purposes in accordance\nwith procedures set forth in the Health Services Manual. The use of restraints on inmates due to mental illness (e.g., to\nprevent suicide or infliction of self-injury) is subject to this\nProgram Statement\u2019s provisions and the Program Statement on\n[Bracketed Bold - Rules]\nRegular Type - Implementing Information P5566.06, CN-1\n8/29/2014\nPage 2\nSuicide Prevention Program. This includes the placement,\nreviews, and release of inmates from restraints at all Bureau\nfacilities, including medical referral centers. This policy\u2019s purpose is not to discourage employees from using\nthe amount of force necessary to protect themselves from assault,\nbodily harm, and/or loss of life. This policy will provide\nguidance and instruction on appropriate procedures when\nconfronted with situations that may require the use of force to\ngain control of an inmate. An employee may not use brutality, physical violence, or\nintimidation toward inmates, or use any force beyond that which\nis reasonably necessary to subdue an inmate. 2. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.\nare: The expected results of this program a. Force will ordinarily be used only when attempts to gain\nvoluntary cooperation from the inmate have not been successful. b. When force is used, it will be only the amount of force\nrequired to subdue an inmate, or preserve or restore institution\nsecurity and good order. c. Confrontation avoidance techniques will be used when\nfeasible to avoid calculated use of force situations. d.",

[TYPES OF FORCE \u00a7552.21.] Since inmates occasionally become\nviolent or display signs of imminent violence, it is sometimes\nnecessary for staff to use force and restraints to prevent them\nfrom hurting themselves, staff, or others, and/or from destroying\nproperty. [a. Immediate Use of Force. Staff may immediately use force\nand/or apply restraints when the behavior described in \u00a7552.20\nconstitutes an immediate, serious threat to the inmate, staff,\nothers, property, or to institution security and good order.] Section 552.20 refers to Section 1 of this Program Statement. P5566.06, CN-1\n8/29/2014\nPage 4 In an immediate use of force situation, staff may respond with\nor without the presence or direction of a supervisor. [b. Calculated Use of Force and/or Application of Restraints. This occurs in situations where an inmate is in an area that can\nbe isolated (e.g., a locked cell, a range) and where there is no\nimmediate, direct threat to the inmate or others. When there is\ntime for the calculated use of force or application of\nrestraints, staff must first determine if the situation can be\nresolved without resorting to force (see \u00a7552.23).] Section 552.23 refers to Section 7 of this Program Statement. (1) Circumstances. Calculated rather than immediate use of\nforce is desirable in all instances corrections workers\nencounter. Although this is not always possible, staff must use\ncommon sense and good correctional judgment in each incident to\ndetermine whether the situation allows for the implementation of\ncalculated or immediate use of force procedures.",

Although this is not always possible, staff must use\ncommon sense and good correctional judgment in each incident to\ndetermine whether the situation allows for the implementation of\ncalculated or immediate use of force procedures. The safety of all persons is a major concern and Bureau of\nPrisons staff are required by laws, rules, and regulations,\nrelated to the Bureau of Prisons, to protect others from the\nhostile actions of inmates. Immediate or unplanned use of force\nby staff is required when an inmate is trying to self-inflict\ninjuries which may be life-threatening or is assaulting any other\nperson to include other inmates. The destruction of government\nproperty may require the immediate use of force by staff in some\ncircumstances. If the above circumstances are not present, staff\nshould, if possible, employ the principles of calculated use of\nforce. Calculated use of force is appropriate, for example, if the\ninmate is in a secure area or in an area where doors/grills may\nbe secured, including cases when the inmate is making verbal\nthreats or brandishing a weapon, provided staff believe there is\nno immediate danger of the inmate inflicting injury or harm to\nhimself or herself or others. Calculated use of force permits\nthe use of other staff (e.g., psychologists, counselors, etc.) to\nattempt to resolve the situation non-confrontationally. (2) Documentation. The entire interaction must be\ndocumented in writing and placed in the FOI Exempt section of the\ninmate's central file. The documentation will reflect the\nactions and responses of each staff member participating in the\nconfrontation avoidance process. P5566.06, CN-1\n8/29/2014\nPage 5 The entire process must be videotaped, including the\nintroduction of all staff participating in the confrontation\navoidance process. The tape and documentation will be part of\nthe investigation package for the After Action Review (see\nSections 14 and 15). Additionally, the Warden must forward a\ncopy of each video tape to the Regional Director within four\nworking days of the incident. [c. Use of Force Team Technique. If use of force is\ndetermined to be necessary, and other means of gaining control of\nan inmate are deemed inappropriate or ineffective, then the Use\nof Force Team Technique shall be used to control the inmate and\nto apply to include ambulatory leg restraints. The Use of Force\nTeam Technique ordinarily involves trained staff, clothed in\nprotective gear, who enter the inmate's area in tandem, each with\na coordinated responsibility for helping achieve immediate\ncontrol of the inmate.] See the Correctional Services Manual section on Use of Force\nTeam Techniques.\n[d. Exceptions. Any exception to procedures outlined in this\nrule is prohibited, except where the facts and circumstances\nknown to the staff member would warrant a person using sound\ncorrectional judgment to reasonably believe other action is\nnecessary (as a last resort) to prevent serious physical injury,\nor serious property damage which would immediately endanger the\nsafety of staff, inmates, or others.] The reviews are conducted to determine compliance with the\nprovisions of this Program Statement. As the team reviews the\nuse of force incident, care should be taken in making a\ndetermination whether sound correctional judgement was used in\nany calculated or immediate use of force given the circumstances\nat the time of the incident.",

The Warden or Acting Warden, Associate Warden (Correctional\nServices), Captain, and Health Services Administrator or designee\nwill comprise the After-Action Review Team. Each review must be\nconducted on the next work day following the incident (see\nSection 15). A representative of the Council of Prison Locals at\nthe appropriate level will be provided a copy of the After-Action\nreport in accordance with appropriate laws, rules, and\nregulations.

[PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE USE OF FORCE AND APPLICATION OF\nRESTRAINTS \u00a7552.22\na. Staff ordinarily shall first attempt to gain the inmate's\nvoluntary cooperation before using force.] See Section 7 of this Program Statement for confrontation\navoidance procedures prior to any calculated use of force.\n[b. Force may not be used to punish an inmate. c. Staff shall use only that amount of force necessary to\ngain control of the inmate. Situations when an appropriate\namount of force may be warranted include, but are not limited to:\n(1) Defense or protection of self or others; (2) Enforcement of institutional regulations; and (3) The prevention of a crime or apprehension of one who\nhas committed a crime. d. When immediate use of restraints is indicated, staff may\ntemporarily apply such restraints to an inmate to prevent that\ninmate from hurting self, staff, or others, and/or to prevent\nserious property damage. When the temporary application of\nrestraints is determined necessary, and after staff have gained\ncontrol of the inmate, the Warden or designee is to be notified\nimmediately for a decision on whether the use of restraints\nshould continue.] Restraints should be used only when other effective means of\ncontrol have failed or are impractical. Designee refers to the Acting Warden or Administrative Duty\nOfficer. An inmate who is pregnant should not be placed in restraints\nunless there are reasonable grounds to believe the inmate\npresents an immediate, serious threat of hurting herself, staff,\nor others, or that she presents an immediate credible risk of P5566.06, CN-1\n8/29/2014 Page 7\nescape that cannot be reasonably contained through other methods.

Staff may apply restraints (for example, handcuffs) to the\ninmate who continues to resist after staff achieve physical\ncontrol of that inmate, and may apply restraints to any inmate\nwho is placed under control by the Use of Force Team Technique. If an inmate in a forcible restraint situation refuses to move to\nanother area on his own, staff may physically move that inmate by\nlifting and carrying the inmate to the appropriate destination.] Staff are cautioned not to use the restraints for lifting or\ncarrying an inmate.\n[f. Restraints should remain on the inmate until self-control\nis regained. If the inmate was placed in restraints because of an assault on\nstaff, the assaulted employee must not be involved in deciding\nwhether the inmate has regained self-control. g. Except when the immediate use of restraints is required for\ncontrol of the inmate, staff may apply restraints to, or continue\nthe use of progressive restraints on, an inmate while in a cell\nin administrative detention or disciplinary segregation only with\napproval of the Warden or designee. h. Restraint equipment or devices (e.g., handcuffs) may not be\nused in any of the following ways:\n(1) As a method of punishing an inmate; (2) About an inmate's neck or face, or in any manner which\nrestricts blood circulation or obstructs the inmate's airways;] Tape shall not be placed around an inmate's mouth, nose, or\nneck. Staff protective equipment must be sufficient to insulate\nstaff from an inmate's spitting or biting, and conform with\n29 CFR 1910.1030 and the Program Statement on Infectious Disease\nManagement. Staff will not use any item or device (e.g., towels,\nsheets, blankets, hosiery, masks) in use of force situations.\n[(3) In a manner that causes unnecessary physical pain or\nextreme discomfort;] In general, when applying restraints, staff will use sound\ncorrectional judgement to ensure unnecessary pressure is not\napplied to the inmate. Although the proper application of restraints may result in P5566.06, CN-1\n8/29/2014 Page 8\nsome discomfort, prohibited uses of restraints include, but are\nnot limited to: \u201chogtying\u201d, unnecessarily tightness, or\nimproperly applied restraints. All inmates placed in restraints\nshould be closely monitored. When it is necessary to use continued restraints after any\nuse of force incident, hard restraints (i.e., steel handcuffs and\nleg irons) are to be used only after soft restraints have proven\nineffective, or a past history of ineffectiveness exists.\n[(4) To secure an inmate to a fixed object, such as a cell\ndoor or cell grill, except as provided in \u00a7552.24.] Section 552.24 refers to Section 10 of this Program\nStatement.\n[i. Medication may not be used as a restraint solely for\nsecurity purposes. j. All incidents involving the use of force and the\napplication of restraints (as specified in \u00a7 552.27) must be\ncarefully documented.] Section 552.27 refers to Section 14 of this Program Statement. This documentation includes, whenever practicable, filming the\nincident and a formal review by the institution\u2019s After-Action\nReview Committee. Reports and videotapes of the incident must be\nreviewed, audited, and monitored by Regional and Central Office. All use of force incidents must be reported and investigated to\nprotect staff from unfounded allegations and eliminate the\nunwarranted use of force. 7.

[CONFRONTATION AVOIDANCE PROCEDURES \u00a7552.23. Prior to any\ncalculated use of force, the ranking custodial official\n(ordinarily the Captain or shift Lieutenant), a designated mental\nhealth professional, and others shall confer and gather pertinent\ninformation about the inmate and the immediate situation. Based\non their assessment of that information, they shall identify a\nstaff member(s) to attempt to obtain the inmate's voluntary\ncooperation and, using the knowledge they have gained about the\ninmate and the incident, determine if use of force is necessary.] Ordinarily, in calculated use of force situations, there is time\nfor the Captain or Shift Lieutenant, Mental Health professional,\nHealth Services staff, Chaplain, or other staff such as the\ninmate\u2019s Unit Manager, Case Manager, or Counselor, to confer and\nassess the situation. P5566.06, CN-1\n8/29/2014\nPage 9 This discussion may be accomplished by telephone or in person. The purpose is to gather relevant information concerning the\ninmate's medical/mental history (e.g., hypoglycemia, diabetes,\netc.), any recent incident reports or situations which may\ncontribute to the inmate's present condition (e.g., pending\ncriminal prosecution or sentencing, recent death of a loved one,\ndivorce, etc.). This assessment should include discussions with staff who are\nfamiliar with the inmate's background or present status. This\ninformation may provide insight into the cause of the inmate's\nimmediate agitation. Additionally, it may identify other staff who may have a rapport\nwith the inmate, and can possibly resolve the incident peacefully\nwithout the use of force. 8. USE OF FORCE SAFEGUARDS. To prevent injury and exposure to\ncommunicable disease in calculated use of force situations, the\nfollowing must occur. a. Staff participating in any calculated use of force,\nincluding those participating in the Use of Force Team technique,\nmust:\n(1) Wear appropriate protective gear in accordance with the\ncircumstances. A list of protective gear to be used, depending\nupon the circumstances, may be found in 29 CFR 1910 and the\nProgram Statements on Correctional Services Manual and Infectious\nDisease Management. (2) Personnel with documented injuries or diseases have an\nobligation to inform management that they are unable to\nparticipate in calculated use of force situations. Staff members\nwill also be asked during their introduction on camera if they\nare willing to participate in this action and have no injuries or\ndiseases that would prohibit their participation. The agency\nwill comply with the hepatitis B vaccination procedures as\noutlined in 29 CFR 1910.1030. b. Personnel with a skin disease or skin injury shall not be\npermitted to participate in a calculated use of force action. c. Recognizing that a rapid response is imperative in an\nimmediate use of force situation, responding staff must use sound\ncorrectional judgment in determining if time is available to\nobtain readily available protective equipment when responding\n(shields, helmets with face shields, pads, jumpsuits, etc.). Often, circumstances will not permit the time to carry this out.

Staff members will treat every calculated use of force as\nif blood and bodily fluids are present. Sufficient protective\nequipment and clothing must be available for all staff\nparticipating in a calculated use of force. Employees must\nreport any exposure to bodily fluids, or other contagious\ndiseases, that occur during the course of their duties. Employees must report these exposures via the injury assessment\nform or through other written methods to the Health Services\nDepartment, as soon as practicable, and appropriate OWCP form(s). The employee should also immediately inform his or her\nsupervisor. If it is possible that an inmate could have transmitted a\ndisease such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the exposed\nemployee may request the inmate to be tested promptly. The\nemployer recognizes this is an extremely important concern, and\ndue diligence will be exercised testing the inmate and processing\nthe test. The employer will notify the employee of the test\nresults immediately upon receipt in accordance with the\nCorrectional Officers Health & Safety Act of 1998. (1) After all use of force incidents, areas where there is\nspillage of blood, or other body fluids, must be sanitized\nimmediately upon the authorization of the Special Investigative\nSupervisor (SIS) or Shift Supervisor, who must first determine\nwhether there is a need to preserve evidence. Procedures for the\ncleaning of blood spillage or bodily fluids must be made\navailable to staff responsible for such cleaning. (2) All blood and body secretions will be removed\nimmediately in the appropriate waste disposal container. The\narea must be washed with an antiseptic solution, pursuant to the\nProgram Statements on Procedures for Handling of HIV Positive\nInmates Who Pose a Danger to Others and Infectious Disease\nManagement. (3) Sanitation measures, in compliance with 29 CFR 1910 and\nSafety directives (i.e., local exposure control plan) must be\nimplemented following use of force incidents where there is a\npossibility of exposure to bodily fluids or potentially\ninfectious materials. Such measures may not take place until the\nscene has been released from the investigatory process. Any\nclothing, including staff\u2019s or inmate\u2019s clothing, as well as P5566.06, CN-1\n8/29/2014 Page 11\npersonal protective equipment which has been exposed to blood\nborne pathogens or other potentially infectious diseases must be\ndisinfected or destroyed immediately. 9. PROGRESSIVE AND AMBULATORY RESTRAINTS. For this PS\u2019s\npurposes, progressive restraints are defined as the process of\nusing the least restrictive restraint method to control the\ninmate as deemed necessary for the situation. Based on the\ninmate's behavior, more restrictive and secure restraints may be\nused. Ambulatory restraints are defined as approved soft and hard\nrestraint equipment which allow the inmate to eat, drink, and\ntake care of basic human needs without staff intervention. The policies and procedures described in Sections 10 and 13 of\nthis Program Statement will be followed for inmates placed in\nrestraints under this section (ambulatory restraints) including:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 conditions of confinement,\nscheduled checks,\ndocumentation, and\n24 and 48 hour reviews by the Warden and staff. Ambulatory restraints should initially be used to restrain an\ninmate if deemed appropriate for the situation.",

      "content": "conditions of confinement,\nscheduled checks,\ndocumentation, and\n24 and 48 hour reviews by the Warden and staff. Ambulatory restraints should initially be used to restrain an\ninmate if deemed appropriate for the situation. An example of\nsuch situations is when an assaultive incident occurred quickly\nand ended, and the inmate is no longer displaying signs of\nviolence or aggressiveness. Using ambulatory restraints for a\nperiod of time may be appropriate for protecting staff and\nothers, pending an assessment by staff to determine whether the\ninmate has regained self-control. Staff should look for a pattern of non-disruptive behavior over a\nperiod of time as an indication the inmate has regained selfcontrol and is no longer a disruptive threat. Additionally, the\n15 minute and two-hour logs should be reviewed to support any\ndecision concerning the release of an inmate in restraints. Inmates asleep at the time of two-hour review will be awakened to\nassess their condition. If the situation dictates the need for more restrictive or secure\nrestraints, i.e., the inmate\u2019s behavior becomes increasingly\naggressive and disruptive, staff must determine the type of\nprogressive restraints to be used (hard restraints with or\nwithout waist chain or waist belt, four-point soft restraints\nwith hard restraints used for securing the inmate to the bed, or\nfour-point hard restraints). P5566.06, CN-1\n8/29/2014\nPage 12 In situations involving highly assaultive and aggressive inmates,\nprogressive restraints should be used only as an intermediate\nmeasure in placing the inmate in or removing an inmate from fourpoint restraints. When it is necessary to restrain an inmate under this section\n(ambulatory restraints) for longer than eight hours, the Regional\nDirector or Regional Duty Officer must be notified telephonically\nby the Warden or designee or the Institution Administrative Duty\nOfficer. 10. [USE OF FOUR-POINT RESTRAINTS \u00a7552.24. When the Warden\ndetermines that four-point restraints are the only means\navailable to obtain and maintain control over an inmate, the\nfollowing procedures must be followed:\na. Soft restraints (e.g., vinyl) must be used to restrain an\ninmate, unless:\n(1) Such restraints previously have proven ineffective with\nrespect to that inmate, or\n(2) Such restraints are proven ineffective during the\ninitial application procedure.] This may not be delegated below the Warden's level. [b. Inmates will be dressed in clothing appropriate to the\ntemperature. c. Beds will be covered with a mattress, and a blanket/sheet\nwill be provided to the inmate.] Under no circumstance shall an inmate be allowed to remain\nnaked or without bed covering placed over the inmate's body\nunless determined necessary by qualified health personnel. [d. Staff shall check the inmate at least every fifteen\nminutes, both to ensure that the restraints are not hampering\ncirculation and for the general welfare of the inmate.

The Lieutenant will\nassemble the staff and visually observe and direct staff as they\ncomplete this task. The Lieutenant will determine what\nprotective equipment is needed, if any, for the staff assisting\nwith the inmates bathroom break. The goal of the two-hour reviews is to determine, as soon as\npossible, that the inmate has regained self-control and may be\nplaced in lesser restraints. See Section 9, Progressive and\nAmbulatory Restraints. Staff should look for a pattern of nondisruptive behavior over a period of time indicating the inmate\nhas regained self-control and is no longer a disruptive threat. Additionally, the 15 minute and two-hour check logs must be\nreviewed to support any decision for lesser measures or the\nremoval of restraints. Inmates asleep at the time of the twohour reviews should be awakened to assess their condition. If an inmate is released temporarily from four-point restraints\nfor any reason, e.g., to use the toilet, consumption of food or\nbeverage, etc., without continuing disruptive or aggressive\nbehavior, the Lieutenant must consider authorizing lesser\nrestraints or removing the restraints. See Section 9,\nProgressive and Ambulatory Restraints. If an inmate is returned\nto four-point restraints after a non-disruptive break, the\nLieutenant, must document the reasons for the action.
