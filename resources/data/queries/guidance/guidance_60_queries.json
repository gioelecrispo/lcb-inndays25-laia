COMPUTING THE CORRECTIONAL COMPLEMENT. A total of 364 days\nis used as a base year for a 7-day post. A 5-day post is 260\ndays. These figures are determined by multiplying the number of\ndays per week a post is manned, i.e., 7-day post, 5-day post, 3day post, and etc., by the amount of weeks in a year (52). After\ndetermining the total number of each post in an institution (7day post, 5-day post, and etc.), each total is multiplied by the\nappropriate base year figures (see examples below). In order to allow for training and annual/sick leave, a position\nis calculated at 210 days per year. The subtotal (man days) is\ndivided by 210. The result is the number of positions required\nto staff the Correctional Services Department. Example:\n` 50 (total number of 7 Day Posts) x 364 = 18,200\n20 (total number of 5 Day Posts) x 260 = 5,200 10 (total number of 3 Day Posts) x 156 = 1,560\nSubtotal: 24,960 (total man days)\n24,960 divided 210 = 118 positions plus 180 man days, which\nequals 119 positions. A remainder of 72 or more is one\nadditional position. To determine the authorized correctional complement for a\nparticular Bureau institution, the following definitions and\ncalculations should be clearly understood:\n1. Post. A post is the location or assignment that is\nactually worked by a staff member. 2. Position.",

QUARTERLY AND DAILY ROSTER ASSIGNMENT. A quarterly\nassignment roster will be prepared at 13-week intervals,\ncorresponding with annual evaluation periods. At institutions\nwhich confines both males and females inmates, at least one male\nand one female staff must be on duty each shift. This\nrequirement is not limited to correctional officers only. For\ninstances, the presence of case managers, counselors, physician\nassistants, etc. will fulfill this requirement. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 1, Page 2\n1. Rotation Policy. Correctional Officers are subject to post\nrotation in accordance with the negotiated agreement. Lieutenants will be rotated two weeks prior to the regular\nassignment roster's effective date. Probationary officers will be rotated monthly. In accordance\nwith the Master Agreement, probationary staff may work nonprobationary posts on overtime or on an as needed basis based on\nspecific needs of the institution. 2. Rosters. When possible, post titles on the quarterly and\ndaily rosters must reflect the duties the officer actually\nperforms. If an assignment's duties are widely varied, the post\ncan be named to identify the major duties involved, with all\nduties identified in the post orders. Lieutenants are responsible for ensuring the daily roster is\naccurate. Pen/pencil markings or other alterations to the daily\nand quarterly rosters are prohibited. The Computerized Correctional Services Roster Program is the\nonly program authorized for the production of Quarterly Rosters,\nDaily Rosters, Assignment Cards, etc.\n3. The local union president or his/her designee will be\nprovided read-only access (including the ability to print) to the\nCorrectional Services Roster Program. 102. OFFICER ASSIGNMENT RECORD. An Assignment Record will be\nmaintained on each officer, including probationary officers. The\nfollowing information will be entered in chronological order at\nthe top of the form:\n1. Full Name 2. Date of Entry on Duty 3. Current Grade Any reason for deviation from normal rotation will be noted after\nthe assignment entry, i.e., job related, self-improvement or\nlimited assignment for health reasons. For those staff unable to\ncomplete the rotation, documentation on the assignment record\nwill reflect the reason for non-rotation. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 1, Page 3\n103. PREPARATION, USE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF POST ORDERS. Post Orders must be based on Bureau and institution policies, and\nmust state each post's duty hours. Post Orders must be prepared under the Captain's supervision and\ndirection. The Captain will sign and date the last page of each\nsection, and initial and date subsequent page changes. A Post\nOrder Master File will be maintained in the Lieutenant\u2019s office\nfor availability to all staff. When a new or different\nassignment is know sufficiently in advance each staff member may\nrequest a reasonable amount of duty time to read the post orders. Ideally, this should take place prior to or immediately upon\nassuming such a post (if the nature of the post permits it). There are occasions when there is no opportunity to read the post\norders.",

There are occasions when there is no opportunity to read the post\norders. In these cases, it is the responsibility of the employee\nto inform the employer of the fact they have not been able or\nafforded the opportunity to read such orders. The employer will\nthen advise the employee of the general requirements of the post,\nand answer any questions. Employees assuming posts under these\ncircumstances still have the responsibility of exercising sound\ncorrectional judgment based upon their training and experience\nand will make reasonable efforts to read the post orders as soon\nas practicable. After reading the post orders, the employee must sign and date\nthe Post Order Review Sheet (Attachment E) which is located in\nSection 5 of the document. This may be accomplished in one of\ntwo places, either the Lieutenant\u2019s office or on the site post. Programs Statements, Operation Memorandums, and other\ninstructions will be made available.

The Post Orders must reiterate to staff that inmates do not\nhave any authority over other inmates. The Post Orders must\nstate clearly that staff are responsible for supervising inmates. 2. Format of Post Orders. Post Orders will describe all\nprocedures and any special instructions regarding a specific\npost. Post Orders are to contain five separate sections in the\nfollowing order:\nSection 1 -- Activities listed chronologically with\nresponsibilities clearly defined. Section 2 -- Special instructions relating to the specific\npost. Note: Post Orders for armed posts, and posts which\ncontrol access to the institution perimeter, must\ncontain a statement to the effect that any\nemployee taken hostage is without any authority,\nregardless of rank or position. Additionally,\nspecific instructions for helicopter escape\nattempts must be included in Post Orders for armed\nposts. Note: Also, the Program Statement on Firearms and Badges\nwill be included in Section 4 of the post orders.

This outline is flexible enough to be adaptable in\nall institutions, but is expected to be defined clearly in the\nInstitution Supplement. Each institution will designate, or by selection to a permanent\nposition, a staff member as the Tool Control Officer. This staff\nmember will insure the tool inventories and procedures are\ncompleted. 201.\n1. TOOL CLASSIFICATION All tools will be classified under three general headings: \uf0b7 Dangerous (Class AA) \uf0b7 Hazardous (Class A) \uf0b7 Non-hazardous (Class B) The Class AA group includes those tools deemed too dangerous to\ninstitutional security for an inmate ever to handle without\nconstant, visual staff supervision. These tools must be secured\nin a manner which deny inmates even the remotest possibility of\naccess.

All Departments must conduct a census of\nall inmates assigned to their area during each work period (AM\nand PM). It is each department\u2019s responsibility to document the\nresults of each census check; for example, AM census check\ncompleted at 8:40 a.m. with no discrepancies, PM census check\ncompleted at 8:40 p.m. with one inmate out of bounds. Discrepancies and action taken must be listed. Institutions will set guidelines and procedures for conducting\nthe census check in an Institution Supplement. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 3, Page 4\n2. Detail Accountability Checks. Lieutenants will conduct\naccountability checks for all work details each month. To ensure\ncompliance with this requirement, 25% of all inmate details will\nbe checked each week. These checks are conducted to identify inmates in unauthorized\nareas, and to determine the presence and accuracy of detail cards\n(crew kit cards). Discrepancies will be immediately corrected. These checks are in addition to the AM/PM census checks the\ndetail supervisors/foremen conduct. a. Accountability checks will be conducted randomly\nthroughout the month at various times with no prior notification. b. The Captain\u2019s office must maintain documentation of all\ndetail accountability checks for 30 days. 3. Lockdown Accountability Checks. Each institution will\nconduct a monthly institution accountability check. The purpose\nof this accountability is to identify inmates in unauthorized\nareas throughout the institution - not to obtain a total head\ncount. a. The accountability check will be announced at a random\ntime and date with no prior notification. b. Upon hearing the announcement of a lockdown\naccountability check, staff must secure all entrances and exits\nin their area, stop all inmate movement, and must survey their\narea of responsibility to account for and verify inmates\nauthorized/unauthorized to be in the area. Staff will identify inmates assigned to the detail or area\nwho cannot be accounted for during the accountability check. The\nLockdown Census forms must be completed on all accountability\nchecks (Attachment D), which includes:\n(1) Names and register numbers of inmates found in\nunauthorized areas and (2) Names and register numbers of inmates assigned to\nthe detail who cannot be accounted for. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 3, Page 5\n305. CONTROL CENTER RECORDS. Picture cards of all inmates\nassigned to the institution will be on file in the Control\nCenter.

The list includes:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7 Housing unit assignment;\nJob assignment; and\nMedical idle or convalescence which exceeds one day. A copy of this document must be available to staff who supervise\ninmate details and each employee responsible for preparing the\nlist of changes. Inmates will not be involved in the process or publication of the\nchange/transfer list. 307. INMATE CALL-OUTS.

All institutions that adopt a pass system\nmust implement the following elements to ensure the program is\nnot compromised. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 3, Page 6\n\uf0b7 Establish a method of daily accountability for all\npasses issued each work day. \uf0b7 Identify an employee to check each issued pass against\nthe stub or copy remaining in the pass book. \uf0b7 Maintain a log to document discrepancies. \uf0b7 Develop a system of reporting pass system discrepancies to\nthe Lieutenant\u2019s Office. \uf0b7 Implement a follow-up system by the Lieutenant\u2019s Office\nwhich includes written notification to the responsible\nemployee with copies submitted to the Captain and\nresponsible employee\u2019s department head. \uf0b7 Departments with noted discrepancies must submit a\nreport of action denoting steps taken to correct\ndiscrepancies to the Lieutenant\u2019s Office. \uf0b7 Frequent discrepancies within the same department must be\nreported to the respective Associate Warden. Follow-ups and accountability for each pass are key elements in\nany effective pass system. 309. DETAIL/CREW KIT CARDS. Control Room Officers must ensure\neach crew kit has current detail cards on all inmates assigned to\nthe detail. At a minimum, crew kit cards must provide:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7 Names of the inmates;\nRegister number;\nCurrent photo (a new photo must be made whenever an\ninmate's appearance changes);\n\uf0b7\u2022 Job assignment;\n\u2022\n\uf0b7 Quarters assignment;\n\uf0b7\u2022 Custody level; and\n\u2022\n\uf0b7 Any special conditions.

BACKGROUND. The Bureau of Prisons, on occasion, may be\nrequested by other Federal, State, or local agencies to provide\nsupportive assistance. Additionally, the Bureau may have\noccasion to request assistance from these agencies. Bureau assistance will be considered based on the Bureau's\nstatutory authority and expertise in the requested area and/or\nthe requesting Federal agency\u2019s authority to empower the Bureau\n(e.g., deputize) to provide the assistance. With respect to non-Federal entities, Federal and state\ngovernments often enter into contractual agreements where one or\nthe other houses inmates from outside its system\n(18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5003). Similarly, the Bureau \"lends\" its Executives\nto various State systems temporarily through the\nIntergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4721). Through its own statutory mandate and the National Institute of\nCorrections, the Bureau provides assistance to non-Federal\nentities (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4042, 4352). Additionally, the Emergency\nFederal Law Enforcement Assistance Program (28 CFR 65) provides\nfor Federal assistance to States in emergencies, upon the\nAttorney General\u2019s approval. 401. DEFINITION. For this Program Statement\u2019s purposes, the\nfollowing definition applies:\nLaw Enforcement Emergency is an uncommon situation which\nrequires law enforcement, which is or threatens to become of\nserious or epidemic proportions, and with respect to which State\nand local resources are inadequate to protect the lives and\nproperty of citizens or to enforce the criminal law. 402. MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU). Ordinarily, direct\nemergency assistance to non-Federal correctional systems is\nlimited to those systems with which the Bureau has an MOU. All\nsuch MOUs must be made available to the employees. These MOUs\nmay be stored with the contingency plans. A MOU, entered into with local, county and State correctional\nentities, is to address the issue of State, as well as Federal,\nassistance. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 4, Page 2\nAbsent an MOU, ordinarily, the Bureau will not provide emergency\nlaw enforcement assistance to non-Federal correctional entities. An exception to this policy may be made when the non-Federal\ncorrectional entity has exhausted its available resources,\navailable resources are inadequate to protect the lives and\nproperty of citizens, and the required assistance (e.g., by the\nState or other localities) cannot be obtained elsewhere in a\ntimely fashion. In such instances, the Bureau may provide\nemergency supportive assistance as set forth in this Chapter. In general, the types of assistance that may be provided without\nan existing MOU should correlate to the typical modes of\nassistance set forth in Section 404 of this Chapter. An MOU\u2019s intent is to provide an avenue for an institution to\nrespond expediently and proficiently to various types of\nemergency situations by developing authorization procedures for\nbasic Federal assistance at the local level, while allowing for\neven greater assistance, if deemed necessary, with higher level\napproval. a. Scope. Bureau institutions, as set forth in the\nCorrectional Services Manual, have included State, county, and\nlocal resources in their institution contingency planning and\noverall emergency preparedness plans.",

      "content": "a. Scope. Bureau institutions, as set forth in the\nCorrectional Services Manual, have included State, county, and\nlocal resources in their institution contingency planning and\noverall emergency preparedness plans. These plans may include agreements with local non-Federal\nagencies for specific assistance. In keeping with such\ninteragency cooperative arrangements, the Bureau may provide\nsimilar emergency assistance to non-Federal correctional\nentities. The scope of such assistance must be established in an MOU\nentered into by the institution\u2019s Warden and authorized nonFederal correctional entity. b. Preparation. Each institution Warden may prepare an MOU\nwhen it is determined to be appropriate. Factors to consider in\nmaking this determination include, but not limited to, the type\nand number of non-Federal correctional systems within the\nimmediate area and availability of non-Federal resources to meet\nthe needs of non-Federal law enforcement during an emergency. The MOU\u2019s purpose is to anticipate possible emergencies and\ndetail in advance the type of assistance the institution would\nprovide if requested. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 4, Page 3 The MOU must specify whom in the non-Federal correctional\nentity is authorized to make such a request and the local\ninstitution\u2019s limits on authorizing various degrees of\nassistance. c. Requests for Assistance. Ordinarily, an outside request\nfor assistance should come from a high-level State authority and\nbe approved only by the institution\u2019s Warden or Acting Warden, in\nconsultation with the Regional Director. The MOU must state that approval by the appropriate Regional\nDirector is required prior to providing assistance. A copy of\nthe MOU must be forwarded to the Assistant Director, Correctional\nPrograms Division, Central Office. When advance approval from the Regional Director is not\npractical, the Regional Director and Assistant Director,\nCorrectional Programs Division, Central Office, must be notified\nas soon as possible of the type of assistance requested and any\naction and/or response provided by the institution. The MOU must contain a statement that Bureau staff may not use\nweapons, ammunition, or chemical agents to provide assistance,\nexcept as authorized by the Deputy Attorney General or Director\nof the Federal Bureau of Prisons in extraordinary circumstances\n(for further discussion on this point see Section 404.d.). d. MOU Preparation Guidelines.\nbe considered in any MOU. The following guidelines must (1) The assistance required must be immediate, short-term,\nand limited to operations which Bureau staff are authorized to\nprovide, and for which they are trained and have expertise, such\nas detention, perimeter security, and transportation of persons\nduly detained by the non-Federal authority. (2) The MOU must provide for financial reimbursement of\nresources expended (including personnel employed beyond the\ninitial response time) and/or damages. (3) Bureau assistance may not extend into operations such\nas crowd control for general public safety projects or for\nenforcing laws associated with scheduled public events. The\nbasis for this limitation is the Bureau's statutory boundaries\nlimiting its scope of expertise to correctional management\nissues. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 4, Page 4\n(4) Ordinarily, Bureau staff are not expected to become\ninvolved in any situation requiring the use of force. When a\nparticular situation necessitates the use of force (e.g., for\nself protection), the application of force must not exceed the\namount of force specified by the Bureau's policies. 403.

REVIEW BY/NOTIFICATION OF REGIONAL DIRECTOR a. Review. While the Warden is the signatory authority for an\nMOU, in every instance the MOU\u2019s prior review and approval by the\nrespective Regional Counsel and Regional Director is required. In conducting this review, the Regional Counsel will consider the\nprovisions of applicable State law. b. Notification. Even in instances when prior approval by a\nRegional Director is not required for some action under the MOU,\nthe Warden (or designee such as Duty Officer) must, as soon as\npractical, provide the Regional Director (or designee such as\nRegional Duty Officer) with a detailed description of any\nassistance provided. 404. TYPICAL ASSISTANCE AND GUIDELINES. The following typical\ntypes of assistance may be considered for inclusion in an MOU. a. Emergency Transportation. Bureau (secure) buses,\nambulances, and vans, driven by trained Bureau staff, may be used\nto transport prisoners who are in a State or county correctional\nentity\u2019s custody. The agency must provide sufficient staff on board to maintain\nsecurity and good order. In this situation, the Bureau is not considered to have assumed\ncustody of the inmates. b. Detention. The Bureau may take into custody detention\ninmates being held for trial or convicted of criminal offenses in\nthe State courts and who are duly detained by the State\ncorrectional entity. Such prisoners may be accepted for detention on a Bureau bus\n(to expedite transportation to another facility) or in a Bureau\ninstitution. Detention on a bus differs from simply providing\ntransportation in that the prisoner is actually transferred into\ntemporary Bureau custody and is subsequently supervised by Bureau\nstaff. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 4, Page 5 Such transfer of prisoners into Bureau custody requires the\nexistence of a contract which allows the Bureau to assume the\noffenders\u2019 custody (see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5003). It is suggested that the MOU incorporate, to the extent\npracticable, the relevant provisions of the aforementioned\nstatute. When feasible, a contract should be considered as an\nappendix to the MOU which addresses the placement of any\nindividual in a Bureau institution temporarily. Absent such a contract, the Bureau will not assume custody of\nState inmates without the appropriate Regional Director's prior\napproval. c. Logistical Support. The Bureau may provide emergency\nsupplies such as blankets, clothing, food, and similar items if\nnecessary to protect the health and safety of others. Clothing marked with the Bureau insignia may not be lent to, or\nworn by, any non-Bureau employee. Equipment, such as fire trucks, vehicles, machinery, and\ngenerators may be provided but ordinarily must be operated by\nBureau staff. Non-Bureau staff may operate Bureau equipment only\nwhen the non-Federal correctional authority has acknowledged that\nits staff is competent to use such equipment. The use of Bureau equipment will be provided only until the\nemergency situation is controlled, and public safety is no longer\nendangered. d. Weapons, Ammunition, and Chemical Agents. The Bureau may\nprovide these items to the non-Federal correctional entity when\nthe non-Federal correctional authority has indicated that its\nstaff are competent to use such weapons, ammunition, and chemical\nagents. This information is to be specified within the MOU.",

This information is to be specified within the MOU. Absent an MOU, weapons, ammunition, and chemical agents may be\nprovided only with prior approval of the Assistant Director,\nCorrectional Programs Division, Central Office. Bureau staff\nwill not use weapons, ammunition, or chemical agents to provide\nassistance to non-Federal correctional entities. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 4, Page 6 If a non-Federal correctional entity requests Bureau staff to\nuse weapons, ammunition, or chemical agents in response to a\nspecific emergency, Bureau staff will do so only with the\napproval of the Deputy Attorney General, unless the Director of\nthe Bureau of Prisons personally concludes that the delay to\nobtain approval would likely result in death or serious bodily\ninjury to employees or inmate hostages (non-Federal correctional\nentities and Bureau). The Director, under the aforementioned circumstances, may\nauthorize the use of such devices and subsequently make a full\nreport to the Deputy Attorney General as soon as possible. e. Perimeter Security. Bureau arrest authority is limited by\nthe provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3050 to making arrests for Federal\ncrimes, although the laws of some States may authorize Bureau\npersonnel to make arrests for State crimes. In States where Bureau personnel have this authority, the MOU\nmay provide provisions which allow Bureau staff to perform\nperimeter security duties at a non-Federal institution in\nsituations when the non-Federal staff are unable to provide\nperimeter coverage. The MOU must also clearly state that \"perimeter coverage\" by\nBureau personnel involves dealing with inmates only, not members\nof the public or media. Non-Federal personnel are responsible\nfor handling the media and public during emergencies at nonFederal institutions. In states that Bureau personnel do not have authority to make\narrests for state crimes, the MOU must provide for Bureau staff\nto perform other functions, including routine duties inside or\noutside a non-Federal correctional institution, therefore,\nfreeing non-Federal correctional staff for primary (e.g.,\nperimeter) coverage. f. Escape Hunts. Based on its limited arrest authority, the\nBureau may not assist in searches for felony offenders who have\nescaped from non-Federal correctional custody. Bureau staff may,\nhowever, conduct searches on Federal penal property. In other\nsituations, Bureau staff may assume other duties as set forth in\nthis Chapter, thereby freeing up additional State or local\ncorrectional staff to track an escapee. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 4, Page 7\ng. Medical Support. Bureau qualified health personnel may\nprovide medical support within their respective areas of health\ncare training or experience. Such support may also include use\nof medical equipment and supplies. h. Hostage Negotiation. The Bureau may provide trained\nhostage negotiators, but ordinarily, their activities are limited\nto background consultations rather than direct negotiations with\ninmates. Decisions to authorize Bureau hostage negotiators to\nactually conduct negotiations must be made no lower than the\nRegional Director level. i. Food Service Support. Bureau personnel may provide food\nservice support. The support may also include the use of food\nsupplies and equipment. 405. CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM. The Bureau may provide trained\nCrisis Management Teams to respond to non-Federal correctional\nemergencies.",

Prior to deploying any Crisis Management Team, the authorization\nof the Attorney General of the United States is required. The\nauthorization must be obtained through the respective Regional\nDirector, Director of the Bureau of Prisons, and Deputy Attorney\nGeneral. 406. SUPPORT ASSISTANCE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES. It is\npossible for other components of the Federal law enforcement\ncommunity to become involved in resolving non-Federal\ncorrectional emergencies. When this occurs, and the Federal component has the legal\nauthority to deputize others, Bureau staff may be deputized. If\nBureau staff are deputized, their authority in such situations is\nlimited to the scope of authority exercised by the empowering\nagency. When practicable, the Assistant Director, Correctional Programs\nDivision, Central Office (CO), will be contacted for approval\nprior to Bureau staff being deputized. When not practicable, the\nnotification must occur as soon as possible. 407. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Warden must notify the\nRegional Director, Assistant Director, Correctional Programs\nDivision, CO, and the Director immediately of all requests for\nemergency law enforcement assistance from a non-Federal\ncorrectional entity. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 4, Page 8 If practicable, this notification is to be made prior to the\nassistance being provided and, if not, as soon thereafter as\npossible.

Each institution Warden with an\nauthorized canine unit must select one handler for each canine. A handler must make a two-year commitment to the program and\ninteract positively with the canine. The handler will work only with the dog originally assigned and\nordinarily should not be assigned collateral duties. A secondary\nhandler may be assigned to feed and service the kennel area if\nthe primary handler is not available. The handler must be willing to care for the canine, control the\nanimal, and obtain maximum productivity from the dog. A handler\nis also required to give clear commands to the canine in the\nlanguage the canine was originally trained.

The necessity to use firearms arises when all available means of\nachieving the law enforcement purpose have failed or are likely\nto fail. An employee is not required to jeopardize personal safety or the\nsafety of others before using firearms to prevent serious\ninjuries/bodily harm or death. If use of firearms is deemed necessary, staff must shoot the\nsubject with every intention of hitting \"center mass\" to ensure\nthe subject is stopped.

The use of firearms is authorized when\ndeemed necessary to prevent an escape in the following\nsituations. (1) Perimeter Walls. At institutions secured with\nperimeter walls, prior to using firearms, staff must reasonably\nbelieve that an inmate has the capability to escape. For example, the inmate may be carrying items that could be\nused to perpetrate an escape, such as, but not limited to, a\nladder, grappling hook, or rope, suggesting an intent to escape. An employee who determines an escape is in progress must\nissue a verbal warning, then fire a warning shot prior to\nshooting the subject. (2) Multiple Perimeter Fences. At institutions secured\nwith multiple perimeter fences, prior to using firearms, staff\nmust reasonably believe that an inmate has the capability to\nescape. For example, the inmate may be carrying items such as, but\nnot limited to, a ladder, blankets, grappling hooks, ropes, broom\nhandles, or sticks, that will perpetrate an escape. PS 5500.14\n10/19/2012\nChapter 7, Page 4 An employee who determines an escape is in progress must\nissue a verbal warning, then fire a warning shot prior to\nshooting the subject.

When the\ninmate actually contacts the first/inner perimeter fence in an\nattempt to climb or demonstrates an attempt to get on or over the\nfirst/inner perimeter fence, and the employee reasonably\ndetermines an escape is being attempted, the employee may shoot\nthe subject. The employee is not required to wait until the inmate is\nbetween the perimeter fences or over the first/inner fences. (3) Metropolitan Correctional Centers (MCCs) and\nMetropolitan Detention Centers (MDCs). When an employee\nreasonably determines that an escape is being attempted from a\nMCC or MDC, the employee should give a verbal warning. If the\ninmate continues, the employee may shoot the subject. Warning\nshots are prohibited due to the possibility of injury to innocent\nbystanders. (4) Minimum Security Institutions. Ordinarily, firearms\nare not used to prevent escapes from minimum security level\ninstitutions. However, weapons are authorized when the escaping\ninmate has used or threatened to use force which is likely to\ncause serious physical injury or has manifested an imminent\nthreat of death or serious physical injury to the employee, other\nstaff and inmates, or the community. Verbal warnings and warning shots should be used when\nfeasible. (5) Escapes with Outside Assistance.
