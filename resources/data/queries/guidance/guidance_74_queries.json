Indirect costs\nIndirect (F&A) costs means those costs incurred for a common or joint purpose that are not readily\nassignable to a particular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance\nof the project. Indirect costs are allowable for this program, but must adhere to the standards set forth in\nthe applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance as stated in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 (Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards) as adopted by the\nU.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 2800.101. Examples of indirect costs include those incurred for facility\noperation and maintenance, depreciation, and administrative salaries. Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses that are approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency\ncarefully track and update its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office grant award period. The grantee understands that if it submitted an expired indirect cost rate agreement at the time of application,\nit will be unable to recover federal funds for indirect costs until the COPS Office receives a current indirect cost\nrate agreement covering the award period. A special condition may be added to the award prohibiting the\nobligation, expenditure, or drawdown of funds reimbursement for indirect costs until a current indirect cost\nrate has been approved by your cognizant federal agency and submitted to the COPS Office. If your agency\u2019s approved indirect cost rate expires during the grant award period, a current approved rate\nmust be submitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down grant funding for indirect costs. Your agency must advise the COPS Office in writing of any changes to your approved indirect cost rate\nduring the grant award period and must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect any\nrate change.",

See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.414(f ). 7 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual In addition, if a provisional indirect cost rate is in effect at grant closeout, your agency shall proceed with\ncloseout, but you will need to complete an expenditure analysis upon receipt of the approved final indirect\ncost rate to determine if an adjustment is necessary. If your agency drew down excess COPS Office funding\nfor indirect costs, then your agency must return the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a revised\nFederal Financial Report (SF-425). If your agency incurred additional indirect costs, then your agency may\nrequest a budget modification if the award is still open and award funds are available.

Please be advised that awardees may not use COPS Office funding for the same item or service also funded by\nanother U.S. Department of Justice award. 4. Travel costs Travel costs for transportation, lodging and subsistence, and related items are allowable under the Community\nPolicing Development Program with prior approval from the COPS Office. Payment for allowable travel costs\nwill be in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.474 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit\nRequirements for Federal Awards) as adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 2800.101.

In other words, state, local, and tribal government awardees may not use COPS Office funds to supplant\n(replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to the COPS Office-funded item(s) in the absence\nof the COPS Office award. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds not be used to replace\nstate or local funds (or, for tribal awardees, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made\navailable for the award purposes. 8 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual What you should do: For state, local, and tribal awardees, CPD funds may not be used to pay for any item or cost funded under\nthe award (equipment, personnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local,\nor BIA funds. In addition, awardees may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within the law\nenforcement budget to another as a result of receiving CPD award funds. If you have questions concerning\nthis award term, and how it pertains to your project budget, please contact your COPS Office Program\nManager. 6. Extensions\nYour agency may request an extension of the grant award period to receive additional time to implement your\ngrant program. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Only those awardees that can provide a\nreasonable justification for delays will be granted no-cost extensions. Extension requests must be received prior to\nthe end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. When justified, the COPS Office will seek to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether\na no-cost time extension is needed. Requests to extend the award period must be received by the COPS\nOffice before the official award end date. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension by the end\ndate may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. Please note that the project period of performance will be extended, if necessary, until the deliverable is\nconsidered final. If the award is set to expire, prior to the final approval of the deliverable, a no-cost extension\nwill be executed for a reasonable amount of time for the awardee to complete the final deliverable. 7.

Modifications\nAward modifications under the Community Policing Development program are evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis. All modification requests involving the reallocation of funding between budget categories that exceed or are\nexpected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of the total award amount must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office\nprior to their purchase or implementation. In addition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any\nmodification request that results in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such\naward modifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items\nor purchasing a different type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you are\nrequired to expend federal funds only as approved in the FCM. Any request to change or alter an award\nshould be submitted to the COPS Office for prior approval, prior to their purchase or implementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it was originally outlined\nand accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within the scope\nof the original intent of the cooperative agreement. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for\nunallowable costs will not be approved. 9 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Your agency may reprogram its budget up to an aggregate (over the course of your project) of 10 percent of\nthe total project cost without prior written approval from the COPS Office. However, you should notify your\nCOPS Office Program Manager of any reprogramming that falls below the 10 percent threshold as well. Once\nthe reprogramming of funds totals an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the award, your agency must seek\nprior written approval from the COPS Office for any additional budget modification requests. What you should do: You are required to notify your COPS Office Program Manager if you determine that your agency will need\nto reprogram award funds. If your modification exceeds an aggregated (over the course of your project) 10\npercent of your overall award, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d\nlink in the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office, providing the proposed\nchanges, details of why the change is needed, etc. Please contact your COPS Office Program Manager for further direction on any additional requirements\nthat may apply to your modification request. The COPS Office will then evaluate your request and notify\nyour agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified award budget may begin following\nwritten approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for active awards will be\naccompanied by a modified Financial Clearance Memo reflecting the approved changes. 8.

Evaluations\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS Office Community\nPolicing Development program. The awardee agrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nact. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may\nassess the way in which your agency implements its CPD award. COPS Office staff or evaluators may study\nthe effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about\nthe programs\u2019 effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they\nmay ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel\nabout community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other\ncommunities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities,\nand obtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate any\nsite visits and information-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely\ninformation about your award activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these\nevaluations. 9. Reports/Performance goals To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is\nused to track your agency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to\ngauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding. 10 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure\nthe proper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the\nprogress of our programs and awardees. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with CPD\nawards. All reports should be submitted to the COPS Office within the deadlines given to avoid suspension\nor possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions. For more information, please refer to\nsection VII, \u201cReports,\u201d on page 50 of this manual. 10.",

Award monitoring activities\nFederal law requires that awardees receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be monitored to ensure\ncompliance with their grant conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS Office is also\ninterested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of\ngrant implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process coordinated\nby the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include site visits,\noffice-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and audit\nresolution. As a COPS Office Community Policing Development awardee, you agree to cooperate with and respond\nto any requests for information pertaining to your grant. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must\ncontain a monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how awardees are adhering to COPS\nOffice award requirements and develops the best technical assistance based on this feedback. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an\nentity designated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds, both programmatically\nand financially. The most common ways are: \u2022 site visits. The COPS Office conducts awardee site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. These visits also provide firsthand observation of the awardee\u2019s community policing\nstrategies. The purpose of site visits is threefold: review community policing activities, ensure awardee\ncompliance, and provide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will be notified\nin writing in advance of any on-site review of your COPS Office awards. This review is generally\nperformed over one or more days and also provides an opportunity for your agency representatives\nto seek assistance on any award implementation issues. Your agency will be notified in writing of the\nresults and any action required to remedy identified grant violations to include potential and actual\nvulnerabilities. In addition, promising practices identified during the site visit are documented and may\nbe shared with the law enforcement community. \u2022 enhanced office-based grant reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, certain grants are selected for a review conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as a\nsupplemental activity in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall grant monitoring strategy. The purpose\nof the EOBGR is threefold: review community policing activities, ensure grantee compliance, and\nprovide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will be notified in writing in advance\nof any EOBGR of your COPS Office grants. This review is generally performed over a one or more day 11 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual period and also provides an opportunity for agency representatives to seek assistance on any grant\nimplementation issues.",

An alleged noncompliance review is a follow up on complaints of alleged noncompliance received from external (media and/or citizen complaints) or\ninternal (COPS Office/DOJ staff ) sources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office staff members determine\nthe appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may\ninclude phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the Office of the Inspector General. \u2022 audit liaison. The U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts random audits\nfor all COPS Office grantees. In the event your agency has any audit recommendations (findings)\nresulting from noncompliance and/or poor accounting practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison\nSection will work with your agency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close\nrecommendations may include repayment of grant funds and/or the submission of documentation. Awardees are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified through these or\nother monitoring or auditing activities. Remedies for noncompliance may include, but are not limited to:\nsuspending award funding, repaying award funds, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination\nof remaining award funds, and restrictions from receiving future COPS Office awards. To avoid findings\nof noncompliance, awardees are strongly encouraged to contact the COPS Office at any time during\nthe life of a COPS Office award with questions concerning award requirements and also to maintain all\nrelevant documentation that may demonstrate award compliance. In addition, grantees should familiarize\nthemselves with the appropriate Grant Owner\u2019s Manual for each COPS Office grant.

Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the U.S. Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that funds the COPS Office, that \u201cthe\nfull and equal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal\njustice system is a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act\u2019s program to reduce crime and delinquency\nin the United States\u201d (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.301). EEOPs do not impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients. What you should do: \u2022 The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal\nstatus, the number of its employees, and the amount of the award.",

An \u201cinter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system\u201d is generally defined as a system that receives,\nstores, analyzes, and exchanges or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities\n(examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking,\ngambling, extortion, smuggling, bribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law\nenforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23 contains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal\ninformation systems that protect individual privacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use CPD award funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated\nforms of technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ndoes not apply to this award. What you should do:\nAll CPD awardees were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence Systems/28\nC.F.R. Part 23 as part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to use\ntheir award funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use\naward funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should have indicated this\nin your application and certified your agency\u2019s agreement to comply with the operating principles found\nat 28 C.F.R.

Why this condition: In general, award recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in some instances, awardees may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: If you have received an award for an item (or group of items) or service in excess of $150,000 and have\nalready determined that the award of a contract through a competitive process is infeasible, you must\nprovide a written justification that explains why it is necessary to contract noncompetitively. The initial determination that competition is not feasible can be made if one of the following circumstances\nexists: \u2022 The item (or group of items) or service is available only from a single source\n\u2022 Public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive\nsolicitation \u2022 Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources",

Awardees are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation\nand subaward information and the award term provides guidance to report the related information, as\nrequired by FFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes\nand systems in place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting\nrequirements should it receive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required\nto report award information on any first-tier subawards totalling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to\nreport information on the names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives\nof the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the\nInternet at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward\ninformation and any executive compensation data required by FFATA.

These civil rights requirements are found in the nondiscrimination\nprovisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d); the Omnibus Crime Control and\nSafe Streets Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3789d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended\n(29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794); the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101, et seq.); Title IX of the Education Amendments\nof 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681, et seq.); and the corresponding DOJ regulations implementing those\nstatutes at 28 C.F.R.

What you should do: As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the\napplicable federal civil rights laws and to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective\nenforcement of such laws and to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes\nproviding access to records, accounts, documents, information, facilities, and staff. 26.

Submit all approved indirect cost rates, if applicable, covering the award period to the COPS Office\nwithin 30 days of approval from the cognizant federal agency. If a provisional indirect cost rate is in effect at grant closeout, the awardee shall proceed with closeout\nbut will complete an expenditure analysis upon receipt of the approved final indirect cost rate to\ndetermine if an adjustment is necessary. If the awardee drew down excess COPS Office funding for\nindirect costs, the awardee must return the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a revised\nFederal Financial Report (SF-425). If the awardee incurred additional indirect costs, the awardee may\nrequest a budget modification if the award is still open and award funds are available. If the awardee\nreturns or draws down COPS Office funding, the awardee will submit a revised final Federal Financial\nReport (SF-425). 35 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual The awardee should pay particular attention to the two areas listed below to ensure that their\napplication of indirect cost rate is in compliance with the existing requirements of the governmentwide award rules set out by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB):\nA. $25,000 Subcontract/Subaward Limitation: Indirect cost rates negotiated on the basis of modified\ntotal direct costs may only be applied against the first $25,000 of any subcontract or subaward\nunder the agreement. This limitation must be applied to all conference related subcontracts\nand subawards, including those with hotels and travel agents. See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200, Appendix\nIII.C.2 (Indirect costs\u2014Institutions of Higher Education); 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200, Appendix IV.B.2c (Indirect\ncosts\u2014Nonprofit Organizations); or 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200, Appendix VII.C.2c (Indirect costs\u2014States, Local\nGovernments, and Indian Tribes). B. Participant Support Costs: Participant support costs are generally excluded from the distribution\nbase. Therefore, indirect costs may not be applied against participant support costs. Participant\nsupport costs are direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel\nallowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (but not\nemployees) in connection with meetings, conferences, symposia, or training projects. See 2 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 200.75. This exclusion applies to the entirety of any subcontracts for the lodging and travel\nof conference participants or trainees (but not employees). Costs related to contractors of the\nrecipient who are acting in the capacity of a \u201cConference Trainer/Instructor/ Presenter/Facilitator\u201d\nare considered participant support costs. For more information on allowable costs for conferences and training, please follow this link:\nwww.ojp.gov/funding/confcost.htm. Indirect costs were removed from the budget if the Awardee did not provide, at the time of\napplication, either a current approved federal indirect cost rate or documentation showing a pending\nrequest for approval by the cognizant federal agency. If the Awardee has never received a federally\napproved indirect cost rate, it may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct\ncosts (MTDC) in lieu of negotiating a rate with the cognizant federal agency.

Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one method of payment available for accessing federal grant funds\u2014the Grant Payment\nRequest System (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables grantees to use a secure Internet\nconnection to request funds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury. A grantee will be able to review previous requests made since July 2009. For more information on the GPRS, please go to www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view the\nuser guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a GPRS account? If you are a new grantee to the COPS Office, your law enforcement executive or government executive\nshould receive notification about GPRS shortly after the COPS Office receives your original signed award\ndocument. This notification will contain all of the information that your agency needs to set up the GPRS\npayment method. If your law enforcement executive or government executive does not perform drawdown\nrequests for your agency, your grant administrator will need to go online to https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/ gprs/welcome to log in and register to become a Drawdown Specialist. Once you are approved, you will\nreceive an e-mail containing a temporary password and information on how to use GPRS. Please note that\npart of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement executive or government\nexecutive or other financial points of contact to validate information provided by the Drawdown Specialist. If you are already registered for a COPS Office grant username in GPRS, and would like to add a newly\nawarded COPS Office grant to the existing COPS Office grant username, contact the COPS Office GPRS\nregistration team via e-mail at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information:\nUser name\nFirst/Last name\nVendor Number\nGrant /Award number (s) to be added How do we fill out the payment enrollment forms?

Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the newly awarded\naward as long as your OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your\nACH enrollment form information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you are\nrequired to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFRs) using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able\nto make drawdowns from your award account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on\nfile with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Awardees are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via\nthe Internet at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see section VII of this\naward owner\u2019s manual, titled \u201cReports,\u201d on page 50. Filing the FFR (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar quarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment\nto ensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as\nnoted above. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances.

Financial Record Maintenance Under the COPS Office CPD Program, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems\nand financial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include\nboth federal funds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately\naccount for the funds awarded. As stated in 2 C.F.R. 200.62 (Internal Control over Compliance Requirements for Federal Awards), your\naccounting system should \u2022 present and itemize actual expenditures of funded items;\n\u2022 demonstrate that funds are spent in compliance with your award conditions;\n\u2022 be able to provide the necessary information for periodic financial review and audit. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and\ncomplete disclosure of the financial activity under your CPD award. Your accounting records should contain\ninformation showing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll\nrecords, time and attendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents.",

Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized\npurposes only. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must documents be kept? All financial records, including payroll, time and attendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, and\nsimilar documents associated with your CPD award must be kept for three years from the date of submission\nof the final expenditure report. See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.333. Your agency should maintain records so that you can\nidentify them by grant year or by fiscal year, whichever you find more convenient. If any litigation, claim,\nnegotiation, audit or other action involving these records has been started before the end of the three-year\nperiod, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These records should be easily located\nand should be properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to maintain adequate records to\ndocument award expenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds that cannot be supported\nwith appropriate records. What if we have more than one award? If your agency has more than one COPS Office award or an award from another federal agency, funds\nreceived under one project may not be used to support another project without specific written\nauthorization from the COPS Office, or in the case of an award from another agency, from both awarding\nagencies. Your accounting systems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project\nseparately. Who may access our records?

Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent\nexaminers. The two primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice\n(DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audits. Requirements and audits What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving\nfederal financial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised June 27, 2003 and again\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003 to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 C.F.R. Part\n200\u2014Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards\n(Uniform Guidance) on December 26, 2013.

Who must have an SAA audit? An awardee that expends $750,000 or more during the awardee\u2019s fiscal year in federal awards must have a\nsingle audit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.514 Scope of audit except when it elects to have a\nprogram-specific audit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a\nsubrecipient, or a vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute,\nin effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA\naudit is to express opinions on the awardee\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major\naward programs, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address\nspecific compliance issues with respect to the COPS Office award requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part,\nFederal agencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in \u00a7200.338 Remedies\nfor noncompliance. These sanctions under \u00a7200.338 Remedies for noncompliance could include the\nfollowing: \u2022 Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the non-Federal entity or\nmore severe enforcement action by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. \u2022 Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost\nof the activity or action not in compliance. \u2022 Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the Federal award. \u2022 Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 CFR part 180 and Federal awarding agency regulations (or in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding\nbe initiated by a Federal awarding agency). \u2022 Withhold further Federal awards for the project or program.\n\u2022 Take other remedies that may be legally available. Your Single Audit Act reports should not be sent to the COPS Office.

The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The primary objective of OIG audits is to assess compliance with award conditions.

OIG audits are designed to\npromote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of awards by evaluating compliance with\nlaws, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the operations encompassed in the scope of the audit. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG may conduct a COPS Office award audit in response to a referral that the OIG believes warrants\nfurther evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ agencies on an annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit\nareas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the OIG selects awards based on a number of\nfactors, including the geographical distribution of awards awarded, award amount, population served, and\ntype of award (both active and expired). As such, the fact that your award has been selected for an OIG audit\nis not necessarily indicative of a suspected concern or problem area. The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division serves as the liaison between awardees and the OIG\u2019s Audit\nDivision, which conducts the audit. After the OIG notifies the COPS Office of upcoming audits to be\nconducted, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division will send out a notification letter to the awardee\noutlining the scope of each audit and the anticipated audit timeframe. This notification letter also advises\nawardees of the supporting documentation required and information necessary for the OIG during their\nscheduled field work, and provides a COPS Office point of contact to address questions and concerns. If you\nhave any questions regarding an OIG audit, please contact the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division at\n800-421-6770. Questions and comments regarding the administration of your COPS Office CPD award, not\nspecifically related to an audit, should be referred to your COPS Office Program Manager. Typical audit findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to awards as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems:\nunallowable costs. Awardee incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget, were in excess of\nthe approved budget, or were charged to the award after the expiration date and an award extension was\nnot obtained. unsupported costs. Specific award expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported, or award\nexpenditures were in excess of actual award costs. lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting.

Reports As part of the CPD program, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as\nwell as quarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CPD\nprogram award funding separately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal\ngrants and awards) to ensure accurate financial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency\nshould ensure that you have financial internal controls in place to monitor the use of CPD program funding\nand ensure that its use is consistent with the grant award terms and conditions. Good practices in this area\nwould include written accounting practices, an accounting system that tracks all drawdowns and award\nexpenditures, and the ability to track when award-funded positions are filled or approved purchases are\nmade. Failure to submit complete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result in the suspension\nand possible termination of your agency\u2019s COPS Office award funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the\nend of the award period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the\nfunding period and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official grant end date;\nhowever, you will have a 90-day grace period after the grant award end date during which you can draw\ndown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before the grant end date.

The due dates for online filing of SF-425s are the same as for the submission of\npaper copies. Example: If your award start date is 02-01-13 and the current date is 04-15-13, then your first SF-425 would be due no\nlater than 04-30-13 and would cover the period 02-01-13 (award start date) through 03-31-13 (end of the\nmost recent reporting quarter). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office so that you can successfully\ncomplete a drawdown of funds through GPRS.

When the Award Period Has Ended At the end of your agency\u2019s Community Policing Development award period, the COPS Office is\nresponsible for the closeout of your award. As part of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation\ndemonstrating that your agency has met all of the programmatic and financial requirements of the award. After the end of the award period, your agency will be asked to submit a final Federal Financial Report and\nany applicable final program reports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final FFR (SF-425) for your grant is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after the end of the grant\nperiod.

Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1. Community partnerships 2. Organizational transformation 3. Problem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the\nindividuals and organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. 63 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages\ninteractive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems\nthrough collaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in\nprioritizing and addressing public safety problems. Other government agencies\nLaw enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools.",

Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal\nand informal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource\nfor identifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific\ngoals at town hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the\ncommunity, and team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncommon interests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue\ngroups, advocacy groups, community development corporations, and the faith community. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners\nbecause they often bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own\nsecurity technology and community outreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can\nalso assist in disseminating information about police and business partnerships and initiatives, and crime\nprevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can\nassist with publicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government\nor community agencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a\nsignificant impact on public perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed\nand how the infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages the application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing emphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and\ninfuse it throughout the entire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel,\nand its technology. 64 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout\nthe agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor\nrelations, decentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures,\norganizational evaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture Changing the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values\nsystematic problem solving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal\nnetworks and communication that take place within agencies to support this orientation.",

Formal organizational changes should support the informal\nnetworks and communication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership Leaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to\nimplement community policing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and\nmission within their organization and support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the\npredominant way of doing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized\nlabor must be a part of the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing\nphilosophy. Including labor groups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are\nimperative to community policing implementation. Decision making Community policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decisionmaking. Decentralized decision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in\ncommunity policing. When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she\nultimately feels accountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of\nthe community. Decentralized decision making involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing\ntolerance for risk taking in problem-solving efforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In\naddition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various resources to attack a problem and allowing\nofficers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community will help define problems and develop\npossible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide\ncommitment to community policing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and\nexpertise. If a strategic plan is to have value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it\nand be able to give examples of their efforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s\nmission and values statement should be simple and communicated widely. Policies Community policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to\nensure that community policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem\nsolving and partnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding\nsets of procedures, where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response\ntimes, tickets issued, and crime rates) community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome\nmeasures to include such things as greater community satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of\nproblems, and improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to\nevaluation\u2014one that looks at how feedback information is used, not only how outcomes are measured. 65 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Transparency Community policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional\npolicing.

If the community is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing\nrelevant information on crime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. Organizational Structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local\npatrol officers have decision-making authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved\nthrough long-term assignments, the development of officers who are generalists, and using special units\nappropriately. Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components With community policing, there is a\nshift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or areas. Geographic deployment of\npatrol officers and specialized components can help enhance customer service and facilitate more contact\nbetween police and citizens, thus establishing a strong relationship and mutual accountability. Patrol\nbeat boundaries should be aligned to neighborhood boundaries to enhance officers\u2019 understanding of\ncommunities within their patrol areas and to build trust within the community. Other community policing\npartners should become familiar with both the patrol officers and community policing officers assigned\nwithin each patrol beat to coordinate government and nongovernment community policing activities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, the culture of policing should strive to have officers\nhave to be able to handle multiple responsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem\nsolving and partnering with the community. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not\njust by special units, although there may be a need for some specialist units that are tasked with identifying\nand solving particularly complex problems or managing complex partnerships. Resources (time, finances, and people) Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial\nresources and the investment of time to support community policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts\nare robust and that partnerships are sustained and effective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an\nagency including recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from\nsworn officers to civilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be\naligned with the agencies\u2019 community policing values. Recruitment, hiring, and selection Agencies need a systematic means of incorporating community\npolicing elements into their recruitment, selection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize\ncommunity policing and problem-solving responsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers\nwho have a spirit of service, instead of only a spirit of adventure. A community policing agency must also\nthoughtfully examine where it is seeking recruits, whom it is recruiting and hiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community involvement in this process through the identification of\ncompetencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations Supervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing\nprinciples and activities that are incorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional\nprocedures should support sound problem-solving activities, proactive policing, community collaboration,\nand citizen satisfaction with police services. Training Training at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles\nand tactics. It also needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and\nanalytical skills, and techniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order.",

Officers can 66 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual be trained to identify and correct conditions that could lead to crime, raise public awareness, and engage\nthe community in finding solutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to\nencourage problem solving and help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community\npolicing is institutionalized in the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place\nregularly. Information technology systems\nCommunity policing is highly information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in helping to\nprovide ready access to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving\nefforts more effective and ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of\ntheir patrol beat. In addition, technological enhancements can greatly assist with accessing information to\nprovide vital resources, with improving two-way communication with citizens, and for developing agency\naccountability systems and performance outcome measures. Communication/access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to\ncommunicate externally with the public and internally within their organization. To communicate with the\npublic, community policing encourages agencies to develop two-way communication systems through the\nInternet that allow for online reports; reverse 911; e-mail alerts; Internet social media discussion forums; and\nfeedback on interactive applications (such as surveys and geographical information), thereby creating open,\nongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters,\ne-mail and enhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with\nother entities for more efficient operations. Community policing also encourages the use of technology to\ndevelop accountability and performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics\nand a broad array of measures and information. Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely\ninformation on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers\nin their patrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem\nanalysis functions by enabling agencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime\nlocations, and quality-of-life concerns, and to further enhance analysis. SAFECOM guidance The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Emergency Communications, in\ncoordination with various stakeholder groups, develops the annual SAFECOM Guidance on Emergency\nCommunications Grants. The guidance provides recommendations to grantees seeking funding for\ninteroperable emergency communications projects, including allowable costs, items to consider when\nfunding emergency communications projects, grants management best practices for emergency\ncommunications grants, and information on standards that ensure greater interoperability. The guidance\nis intended to ensure that federally funded investments are compatible and support national goals and\nobjectives for improving interoperability nationwide.

Quality and accuracy of data Information is only as good as its source, and therefore it is not useful if it is of\nquestionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to\nensure that information from various sources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central\nsystems that are linked to one another and checked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for\nstrategic planning, problem solving, and performance measurement. 67 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving\nmust be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to\nthink innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential\nresponses. A major conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured\nand disciplined way is the SARA (scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine\nthe scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more\nincidents similar in one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can\nbe a type of behavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses,\nestablish correlation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is\nimportant to find out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?,\nwhen?, where?, how?, why?, and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem.",

The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem or reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the\nproblem declined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the\ncurrent effort but also gathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be\nassessed for process, outcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information\ngathered during analysis should be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new\nsolutions can be developed and tested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear,\nmeaning that additional scanning, analysis, or responses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for\nexample, capable guardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders\n(e.g., parents, friends, and probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees, 68 2015 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual and motel clerks). Rather than focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the police\nfocus on the factors that are within their reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to victims,\nincreasing guardianship, and associating risk with unwanted behavior.
