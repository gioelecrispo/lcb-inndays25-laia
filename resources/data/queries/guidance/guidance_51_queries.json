The 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) is designed to\nadvance public safety by providing funds to state law enforcement agencies with high rates of primary\ntreatment admissions for heroin and other opioids. This AHTF funding must be used for investigative purposes\nto locate or investigate, through statewide collaboration, illicit activities, including activities related to the\ndistribution of heroin or unlawful distribution of prescriptive opioids and unlawful diversion and distribution of\nprescriptive opioids.",

The allowable uses of your agency\u2019s AHTF award are specified on the AHTF Financial Clearance Memorandum\n(FCM). If your agency\u2019s local fiscal conditions have changed since submitting the FY 2016 AHTF application and\nyour agency wishes to modify its AHTF award to reprogram awarded funding into different funding categories,\nplease refer to award condition #6 on page 10 of this manual for detailed information on requesting a postaward modification. This AHTF Award Owner\u2019s Manual will assist your agency with the administrative and financial matters\nassociated with your award. It was developed by the COPS Office to ensure that all AHTF recipients clearly\nunderstand and meet the requirements of their award. Please review this manual carefully because a failure to\nfollow award requirements can have serious ramifications. Please do not hesitate to call the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 if you need assistance with the implementation of your award. Please note that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is retiring the current Summary Reporting System (SRS)\nand will transition to an all-National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data collection system within the\nnext five years. The transition to NIBRS will provide a more complete and accurate picture of crime at the\nnational, state, and local level. Beginning in 2021, the FBI will no longer collect summary data and will only\naccept data in the NIBRS format, and COPS Office awards will be based on submitted NIBRS data. Transitioning\nall law enforcement agencies to NIBRS is the first step in gathering more comprehensive crime data. The COPS\nOffice encourages its award recipients to submit NIBRS data to the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services\nDivision in a timely manner, thereby ensuring sufficient and complete crime and arrest data is available for\nconsideration. For more information regarding NIBRS reporting, please see https://www.fbi.gov/aboutus/cjis/ucr/nibrs-overview. When your agency applied for AHTF funding, your agency was required to certify compliance with all applicable\nfederal laws. In that regard, members of Congress have asked the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to examine\nwhether jurisdictions with \u201csanctuary policies\u201d (i.e., policies that either prevent law enforcement from releasing\npersons without lawful immigration status into federal custody for deportation or policies that prevent state or\nlocal law enforcement from sharing certain information with U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\nofficials), are in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a71373. For that reason, all recipients for this program should understand that\nif the COPS Office receives information which indicates that a recipient may be in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a71373 (or\nany other applicable federal law) that recipient may be referred to the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG)\nfor investigation.",

Therefore, it is important to have your agency\u2019s\naward number (or your agency\u2019s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI, the COPS Office assigns\na non-official ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two characters will be \u201cZZ\u201d). If you\nhave any questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your agency\u2019s ORI number\nwhen you contact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency\u2019s nine- or thirteendigit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP vendor\nnumber differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for administrative\npurposes in connection with this program, and should not be used for IRS purposes. 2 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Award terms and conditions The award terms and conditions are listed on your agency\u2019s award document.

Your agency will be responsible for the information and rules contained in this manual and for\nimplementing your award in compliance with the applicable terms, conditions, and regulations. More detailed\nguidance regarding any particular award requirement or your agency\u2019s specific circumstances can be requested\nthrough your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist.

What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS Office award programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at the\ntime of application and application update. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have\nread, understood, and accepted the award terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications.

Allowable Costs\nCondition: The funding under this project is for the payment of approved costs for activities related to the establishment and\nenhancement of a variety of problem-solving strategies to investigate heroin and other opioid problems in your\njurisdiction. The allowable costs for which your agency\u2019s award has been approved are limited to those listed on the\nFinancial Clearance Memorandum (FCM), which is included in your agency\u2019s award package. The Financial Clearance\nMemorandum FCM specifies the costs that your agency is allowed to fund with your AHTF award, and specifies the\noverall amount approved for each budget request category. Your agency may not use AHTF award funds for any\ncosts that are not identified as allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual allowable\ncosts incurred during the award period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown. If your agency experiences\nany cost savings over the course of the award (for example, your award application overestimated the total entry-level 4 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual officer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use that excess funding to extend the length of the\naward beyond 24 months. Any funds remaining after your agency has drawn down for the costs approved during the\n24 month funding period will be deobligated during the closeout process, and should not be spent by your agency. Note that certain \u201cControlled Equipment\u201d as described in the \u201cRecommendations Pursuant to EXECUTIVE\nORDER 13688 Federal Support for Local Law Enforcement Equipment Acquisition,\u201d available at\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/le_equipment_wg_final_report_final.pdf, may be\ndisallowed or require additional justification and certifications.

Particular items of fringe benefits must fall within the categories authorized by the COPS Office. Authorized\nfringe benefits include FICA, Social Security, health insurance, life insurance, vacation, sick leave, retirement,\nworker\u2019s compensation, and unemployment insurance. Other costs\nProject-related expenditures that do not conform to any of the category descriptions specified above (i.e. sworn\nofficer overtime) were included in this section of your FCM. In addition, items that have a direct correlation to the\noverall success of a recipient\u2019s project objectives and are necessary for the project to reach full implementation\nwill be considered on a case-by-case basis by the COPS Office. Requests may be made only for items or positions that are not otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA\nfunds, and would not be funded in the absence of the AHTF award. If at any time you are unsure if an item is considered allowable or unallowable, please contact your COPS Office\nGrant Program Specialist for further assistance. Please be advised that recipients may not use COPS Office funding for the same item or service also funded by another\nU.S. Department of Justice award. See also award condition #13 on page 16, \u201cDuplicative Funding.\u201d 4. Supplementing, Not Supplanting\nCondition:\nRecipients must use AHTF funds to supplement, and not supplant, state, local, or Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds\nthat are already committed or otherwise would have been committed for award purposes (hiring, training, purchases,\nand/or activities) during the award period. In other words, recipients may not use COPS Office funds to supplant\n(replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to the COPS Office-funded item(s) in the absence of\nthe COPS Office award. 7 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds not be used to replace state\nor local funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made available for\nthe award purposes.",

What you should do:\nAHTF funds may not be used to pay for any item or cost funded under the award (equipment, personnel,\ntraining, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA funds. In addition, recipients\nmay not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within the law enforcement budget to another as a\nresult of receiving AHTF award funds. If you have questions concerning this award term and how it pertains to\nyour project budget please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. Personnel To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Each individual employed under the COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force program award is newly hired on\nor after the award start date, unless an exception is authorized in writing by the COPS Office. If current\npersonnel are redeployed into this program, they must be paid with local funds.

You may not cancel or postpone spending money in\nyour budget that is committed to hiring other new officers or civilians. \u2022 You must take expeditious and timely steps to fill any vacancies that were created on or after the date of\nyour award application by retirement, resignation, or other reasons with new officers or civilians other than\nyour COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force program positions. Example: If you are redeploying a current employee who would otherwise be paid $75,000 in salary and benefits\nduring the life of the award project, your agency must continue to pay this employee with local funds. The COPS\nOffice award funds may be used to backfill the resulting vacancy with a new hire, even though the COPS Officefunded position will not be working directly on the COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force program.

For example, a recipient who has budgeted local funds to pay for a new\ncomputer system may not reallocate those funds to pay for any other law enforcement cost as a result of\nreceiving AHTF funds for the same computer system. 8 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Overtime To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Sworn officer overtime exceeds expenditures that you are obligated or funded to pay in the current\nbudget. Funds currently allocated to pay for overtime may not be reallocated to other purposes or\nreimbursed upon the award of a COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force program award. Additionally, by the\nconditions of this award, you are required to track all overtime funded through the COPS Office Anti-Heroin\nTask Force program. Training To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Any training provided by the COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force program is in addition to the number of\nhours of training already provided by your agency. Funds currently allocated for training may not be\nreallocated to other purposes. Note: This award condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your\nagency under this award. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any state or locally funded partnership\nagencies use COPS Office funds only to supplement, not supplant, their state or local funding as described in this\ncondition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 24 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 24 months will be evaluated on a caseby-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted no-cost\nextensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays, or other\ncircumstances that interrupt the 24 month award funding period. An extension allows your agency to compensate for\nsuch delays by providing additional time to complete the full 24 months of funding. Extension requests must be\nreceived prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days before the award end date. Requests to extend the award period must be submitted online and received by the COPS Office before the\nofficial award end date.",

Failure to submit a request\nfor a no-cost time extension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award\nfunds. All extension requests require review and approval by the COPS Office. Individual or cumulative requests greater\nthan one-half of the award\u2019s original term (i.e., 12 months) will require additional justification and must include a\ndetailed timeline. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the award due to salary and fringe benefits costs that\nwere lower than anticipated, your agency cannot extend the 24-month funding period for the purpose of\nexpending those excess funds. Recipients are entitled to a maximum of 24 months of federal funding based on\nthe approved salary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining award\nfunds during the closeout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time extension,\nplease contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency\u2019s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS Office\nAHTF award. Award modifications under AHTF are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All modification requests\ninvolving the purchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their\nimplementation. In addition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that\nresults in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may expend award funds\nonly as approved in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Any requests to change or alter awards require\nwritten approval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Without prior written approval, you must\ncontinue to implement your award as it was originally awarded and accepted by your agency. Please be advised\nthat reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be approved (construction, indirect costs, etc.). What you should do: For all other modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link\nin the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office, providing the proposed changes,\ndetails of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific award modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified award may begin\nfollowing written approval from the COPS Office.",

Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the AHTF award. The recipient agrees to\ncooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may\nbe carried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine what programs are working, how programs may be improved, and\nwhy certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which\nyour agency implements its AHTF award. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff members or evaluators may\nstudy the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about\nthe programs\u2019 effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask\nquestions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel about\ncommunity policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other communities\nand police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your department, observe activities, and obtain\nwritten reports about and from your department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and informationgathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information about your award\nactivities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be responsible\nfor submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the reporting period\nand quarterly Federal Financial Reports that track actual expenditures of allowable costs using Standard Form 425\n(SF-425). The progress report is used to track your agency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing\nstrategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity\nthrough COPS Office funding. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress\nof our programs and recipients.

Agencies with more than one delinquent\nprogrammatic or financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement\nfor allowable expenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to improve compliance with\nreporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in section VI, \u201cReports,\u201d on page 44 of this manual. All\nreports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award\nfunds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both\naspects of award implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process\ncoordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include site\nvisits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and audit\nresolution. As an AHTF award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests for information\npertaining to your award. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain\na monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are complying with COPS Office\naward requirements. In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance\nto help ensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds, both programmatically and\nfinancially.

The purpose of site visits is threefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award ii. To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies iii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare for\nthe review of their COPS Office awards.

An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance\nDivision, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a noncompliance issue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants,\nmedia, citizens, law enforcement agencies, other Federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-bycase basis, COPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS\nOffice staff or the OIG.

Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and\nsubaward information and the award term provides guidance to report the related information, as required by\nFFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and\nsystems in place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements 20 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual should it receive funding.

Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters\nCondition:\nThe Office of Management and Budget requires federal awarding agencies to include the following standard award\nterm in all awards over $500,000 made on or after January 1, 2016:\nA. Reporting of Matters Related to Recipient Integrity and Performance\n1. General Reporting Requirement If the total value of your currently active awards, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts\nfrom all Federal awarding agencies exceeds $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of\nperformance of this Federal award, then you as the recipient during that period of time must maintain\nthe currency of information reported to the System for Award Management (SAM) that is made available\nin the designated integrity and performance system (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and\nIntegrity Information System (FAPIIS)) about civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings described in\nparagraph 2 of this award term and condition. This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of\nPublic Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all\ninformation posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except\npast performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. 2. Proceedings About Which You Must Report\nSubmit the information required about each proceeding that:\na. Is in connection with the award or performance of an award, cooperative agreement, or\nprocurement contract from the Federal Government;\nb. Reached its final disposition during the most recent five year period; and\nc. Is one of the following:\n(1) A criminal proceeding that resulted in a conviction, as defined in paragraph 5 of this award\nterm and condition;\n(2) A civil proceeding that resulted in a finding of fault and liability and payment of a monetary\nfine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more;\n(3) An administrative proceeding, as defined in paragraph 5. Of this award term and condition,\nthat resulted in a finding of fault and liability and your payment of either a monetary fine or\npenalty of $5,000 or more or reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000; or\n(4) Any other criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding if:\ni.

Reporting Procedures\nEnter in the SAM Entity Management area the information that SAM requires about each proceeding\ndescribed in paragraph 2 of this award term and condition. You do not need to submit the information a\nsecond time under assistance awards that you received if you already provided the information through\nSAM because you were required to do so under Federal procurement contracts that you were awarded. Reporting Frequency\nDuring any period of time when you are subject to the requirement in paragraph 1 of this award term\nand condition, you must report proceedings information through SAM for the most recent five year\nperiod, either to report new information about any proceeding(s) that you have not reported previously\nor affirm that there is no new information to report. Recipients that have Federal contract, award, and\ncooperative agreement awards with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 must disclose\nsemiannually any information about the criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings. Definitions For purposes of this award term and condition:\na. Administrative proceeding means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to\nmake a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative\nproceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract\nAppeals proceedings). This includes proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in\nconnection with performance of a Federal contract or award. It does not include audits, site visits,\ncorrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. b. Conviction, for purposes of this award term and condition, means a judgment or conviction of a\ncriminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or a plea,\nand includes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere. c. Total value of currently active awards, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts\nincludes\u2014 (1) Only the Federal share of the funding under any Federal award with a recipient cost share or\nmatch; and\n(2) The value of all expected funding increments under a Federal award and options, even if not yet\nexercised. Why this condition:\nUnder 2 CFR \u00a7 200.210 (b) (1) (iii), recipients of awards in excess of $500,000 are required to report certain civil,\ncriminal, and administrative proceedings if they have active federal awards, cooperative agreements, or\ncontracts (or any combination of these) that total more than $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period.

What you should do: If the total value of your active awards, cooperative agreements, and contracts from all federal awarding\nagencies exceeds $10,000,000 during the COPS Office award period, then you must ensure that the proceedings\ndescribed in paragraph 2 of this award term that are reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) are\ncurrent. The information about the reported proceedings is made available in SAM via the designated integrity\nand performance system (currently the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System\n(FAPIIS)). During the award period, you must either report for the most recent five year period new information\nabout any proceeding(s) that you have not reported previously or affirm that there is no new information to\nreport. You must also disclose semiannually any information about criminal, civil, and administrative\nproceedings. 27 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual 25. Computer Network Requirement\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees that no award funds may be used to maintain or establish a computer network\nunless such network blocks the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. Nothing in this requirement\nlimits the use of funds necessary for any federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any other entity\ncarrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. Why this condition:\nSection 533 of Division B, Title V, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L.\n114-113) prohibits the use of federal funds to maintain or establish a computer network that does not block the\nviewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. This provision protects the public interest in the proper\nmanagement and use of federal funds. What you should do: The recipient must not use award funds to maintain or establish a computer network unless the network blocks\npornography. This does not limit the use of funds for criminal investigations, prosecution or adjudication\nactivities. 26. Contracts and/or MOUs with Other Jurisdictions\nCondition:\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, sworn law enforcement officer positions and civilian positions, awarded\nmust only be used for law enforcement activities or services that benefit your agency/taskforce and the population\nthat it serves. The items funded under an AHTF award cannot be utilized by other agencies/taskforces unless the items\nbenefit the population that your agency/taskforce serves. Why this condition: The AHTF award is intended to benefit the communities within the recipient\u2019s primary law enforcement\njurisdiction. Therefore, the recipient must use the AHTF award funding to benefit its own service population. What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the AHTF award cannot provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies\nunless they will directly benefit the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, a sheriff\u2019s department cannot use an\nAHTF-funded officer to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but can use the\nAHTF-funded officer to provide direct law enforcement services to towns within its own county. 27. Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using AHTF funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with operating\nprinciples of 28 C.F.R. Part 23.",

Part 23. 28 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found in 28 CFR Part 23. An\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system that receives, stores, analyzes,\nand exchanges or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 CFR Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems which protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use AHTF program funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated\nforms of technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 CFR Part 23 does\nnot apply to this award. What you should do:\nAll AHTF recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence Systems/28 CFR Part 23 as part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to use their\naward funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use award\nfunds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should have indicated this in your\napplication and certified your agency\u2019s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 CFR Part\n23. Your agency now must comply with 28 CFR Part 23 in operating the inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence\nsystem funded through your AHTF award. 28. Sole Source Justification\nCondition:\nAHTF recipients who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group of items) or service in\nexcess of $150,000 and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement process must provide a\nwritten sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating, expending, or drawing down\naward funds for that item or service. Why this condition: In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in\nsome instances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: An award recipient must request written approval from the COPS Office for sole source procurement in excess of\n$150,000 prior to purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract; or entering\ninto a contract with award funds.",

For assistance with financial management and award administration, please contact the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one payment system available for accessing federal award funds\u2014the Grant Payment Request\nSystem (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables recipients to use a secure Internet connection to\nrequest funds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States\nDepartment of the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the\nprimary system that agencies use for EFT. A recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made\nsince July 2009. For more information regarding GPRS, please go to\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view the User Guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a GPRS account? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s) will\nbe responsible for requesting federal funds for your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The\nindividual(s) selected must click on https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome and register with the GPRS\nsystem to become a Drawdown Specialist for your agency. Once you have been approved, you will receive an e-mail containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement\nexecutive and/or government executive or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process. All individuals who need access to GPRS must register separately and\ncreate their own unique GPRS username account, as these accounts are not meant to be shared. How do we add an award to an existing GPRS account? If you are currently registered for an active COPS Office award username in GPRS and would like to add a\nrecently awarded COPS Office award to your existing COPS Office award username, contact the COPS Office\nGPRS registration team via e-mail at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following\ninformation:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 User name (for COPS Office awards) First/last name\nVendor number (as listed on your award document)\nAward number(s) to be added 34 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual How do we fill out the payment enrollment forms? If you are a new award recipient to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on the\nCOPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf.

If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment\nform information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Staff Accountant. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you are\nrequired to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports (FFRs) using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able to\nmake drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the\nCOPS Office by the deadline date. Recipients are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at\nhttps://portal.cops.usdoj.gov/. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see section VI of this\nmanual, titled \u201cReports,\u201d on page 44. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. 35 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the recipient\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4. is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\nmaintains excess cash on hand;\ndoes not adhere to the terms and conditions of the award;\nfails to submit reliable or timely reports. How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements; however, your reimbursement\nrequests should cover a specific time frame and include only costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM).",

As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once. Can we earn interest on our award funds? For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified at 31\nCFR Part 205 \u2018\u2018Rules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers\u2019\u2019 and TFM 4A\u20132000 Overall\nDisbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies.

You must\naccount for interest earned on advances of federal funds as follows:\n\u2022 The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance at 2 CFR \u00a7 200.305(b)(9) states that interest\nearned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year may be\nretained by the nonfederal entity for administrative expenses. \u2022 Any interest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts that is in excess\nof $500 per year must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment\nManagement System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nnetwork or a Fedwire Funds Service payment. For detailed information on remittance, please see appendix\nG on page 75 for a full text of the electronic medium remittance options. \u2022 If you do not have access to an electronic medium option, then please make a check payable to \u201cThe\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\u201d and mail the check to Treasury-approved lockbox: HHS\nProgram Support Center, P.O.

Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for\nthe funds awarded. As required by 2 CFR 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your accounting\nsystem should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the following\nobjectives for federal awards:\n\u2022 Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. \u2022 Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. \u2022 Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your AHTF award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, cancelled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your AHTF award (including payroll, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, and purchase orders) must be retained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.333 (Retention requirements for\nrecords). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever\nyou find more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving these records has\nbeen started before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These records should be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to\nmaintain adequate records to document award expenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds\nthat cannot be supported with appropriate records. 38 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What if we have more than one award?

Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The two primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving\nfederal financial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 CFR Part 200\u2014\nUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform\nGuidance) on December 26, 2013. This new guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments\nawarded on or after December 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of\nSAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7200.514 (Scope of audit) except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987 to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit\nis to express opinions on the recipient\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address specific\ncompliance issues with respect to COPS Office award requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, federal\nagencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in \u00a7200.338 Remedies for\nnoncompliance. These sanctions under A-133, section 225 could include the following:\n\u2022 Temporarily withholding cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or\nmore severe enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. \u2022 Disallowing (that is, denying both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost\nof the activity or action not in compliance. \u2022 Wholly or partly suspending or terminating the federal award. 40 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual",

Questions and comments regarding SAA audits may\nbe directed to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the OIG for award audits? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits\nare designed to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believed warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on\nan annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances,\nhowever, the OIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the\ngeographical distribution of awards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and\nexpired), and type of award (hiring and non-hiring). As such, the fact that a recipient has been selected for an\nOIG audit is not necessarily indicative of a suspected concern or problem area. 41 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What are the steps in an OIG audit? The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Audit Liaison Section serves as the liaison between recipients and\nthe OIG\u2019s Audit Division, which conducts the audit.

Typical audit findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to awards as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record-keeping systems:\n\u2022 Unallowable costs. Recipient incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget or a budget\nmodification, were in excess of the approved budget, or were charged to the award after the expiration\ndate and an award extension was not obtained. \u2022 Unsupported costs. Specific award expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by\nadequate documentation (including but not limited to receipts or purchases orders), that may have been\nallowable under the program, but for which no prior written approval was obtained from the COPS Office ,\nor award expenditures were in excess of actual approved award costs. \u2022 Lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Recipient failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. \u2022 Funds to better use. Funds could be used more efficiently based on management actions such as\nreductions in outlays; deobligation of funds; withdrawal; costs not incurred by implementing\nrecommended improvements; and any other identified savings. \u2022 Questioned costs. Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted\nfrom a violation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, award terms and conditions, or other\ndocument governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable and do not\nreflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because costs at the time\nof the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. 42 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual \u2022 Policy and procedure.

You must keep all\ndocumentation related to the audit for a period of three years following the audit\u2019s closure. 43 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual VI. Reports As part of the AHTF Program, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well\nas quarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report AHTF program\naward funding separately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal awards) to\nensure accurate financial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you\nhave financial internal controls in place to monitor the use of AHTF funding and ensure that its use is consistent\nwith the award terms and conditions. Good stewardship in this area would include written accounting practices,\nuse of an accounting system that tracks all award drawdowns and expenditures, and the ability to track when\naward-funded positions are filled or vacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to\nsubmit complete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result in the suspension and possible termination of\nyour agency\u2019s COPS Office award funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within\n30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the\naward period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period\nand the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds.",

This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period\nand the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted\nto draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however, you will have a 90day grace period after the award end date during which you can draw down funds for eligible expenditures\nincurred before the award end date. How do we file a Federal Financial Report (SF-425)? All COPS Office award recipients are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Recipients are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office website at\nhttps://portal.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link in the upper right corner to log in; once you\nare logged in, select \u201cApplications\u201d from the agency portal menu, click on the \u201cSF-425\u201d icon, and follow the\ninstructions to complete and submit your reports. The online SF-425 requires the same reporting information as\nthe paper version. The use of this online application enables authorized users to view past SF-425s and allows\nthem to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports (SF-425) due? SF-425s for COPS Office awards must be submitted every quarter and no later than 30 days after the last day of\neach reporting quarter, as detailed in table 1:\nTable 1. Due dates of SF-425s by quarter\nReporting quarter\nJanuary 1\u2013March 31\nApril 1\u2013June 30\nJuly 1\u2013September 30\nOctober 1\u2013December 31 SF-425 due date\nApril 30\nJuly 30\nOctober 30\nJanuary 30 44 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual For your initial SF-425 submission, determine when the most recent SF-425 reporting quarter ended and\ncomplete an SF-425 to cover the period from the award start date of your award to the end of that period. You\nare required to submit an SF-425 even if you have not spent any money or incurred any costs during a\nreporting period. The due dates for online filing of SF-425s are the same as for the submission of paper copies. Example: If your award start date is 02-01-13 and the current date is 04-15-13, then your first SF-425 would be due no later\nthan 04-30-13 and would cover the period 02-01-13 (award start date) through 03-31-13 (end of the most recent\nreporting quarter). This SF-425 must be on file with the COPS Office so that you can successfully complete a\ndrawdown of funds through GPRS. Awardees who do not submit SF-425s by the due date each quarter will be unable to draw down funds until the\nreport has been successfully submitted. The payment system contains a function which checks for SF-425\ndelinquency and will reject a drawdown attempt if the SF-425 is not up to date. Subsequent e-mail, fax, or hard\ncopy reminders may be sent to the recipient if the SF-425 is delinquent.

In addition, once\nyou have completed your final drawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of federal funds\ndrawn down by your agency. The final SF-425 report should also reflect the total amount of the local cash match (if required) contributed over\nthe 36-month award period, which should be at least 25 percent of the total award project, unless waived by the\nCOPS Office in writing. The federal funds expended should reflect only the actual allowable incurred salary and\nfringe benefit costs for the 36-month award period that each award position was occupied.

Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency has incurred but not\nyet paid.

In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period following award\nexpiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess award funds remaining in your account following the award\nperiod due to an overestimate of item costs during the award period. Your agency should review its records\ncarefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred during\nthe award period.

      "content": "Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1.\n2.\n3. Community partnerships\nOrganizational transformation\nProblem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the individuals\nand organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages\ninteractive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through\ncollaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and\naddressing public safety problems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement\nagencies, health and human services departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific goals at\ntown hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the community,\nand team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncommon interests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups,\nadvocacy groups, community development corporations, and the faith community. 60 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because\nthey often bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help\nidentify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and\ncommunity outreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating\ninformation about police-business partnerships and initiatives, and crime prevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community\nagencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on\npublic perceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how\nthe infrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages\nthe application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the\nentire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology.

Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the\nentire department, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem\nsolving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and\ncommunication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of doing business. 61 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part\nof the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor\ngroups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing\nimplementation. Decision making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision-making. Decentralized\ndecision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision\nmaking involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving\nefforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate\nvarious resources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the\ncommunity will help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan is to\nhave value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their\nefforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and values statement should be\nsimple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of\nprocedures, where appropriate. Organizational evaluations",

Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of\nprocedures, where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime\nrates) community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include greater community\nsatisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality of life. Community\npolicing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks not only at measured outcomes,\nbut also at how feedback information is used. Transparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the\ncommunity is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant information on\ncrime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. 62 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local patrol officers have decisionmaking authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term assignments,\nthe development of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or\nareas. Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components can help enhance customer service\nand facilitate more contact between police and citizens, thus establishing strong relationships and mutual\naccountability. Patrol beat boundaries should be aligned to neighborhood boundaries to enhance officers\u2019\nunderstanding of communities within their patrol areas and to build trust within the community. Other\ncommunity policing partners should become familiar with both the patrol officers and community policing\nofficers assigned within each patrol beat to coordinate government and nongovernment community policing\nactivities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, the culture of policing should strive to have officers have to be able to\nhandle multiple responsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with\nthe community. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just by special units, although\nthere may be a need for specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly complex\nproblems or managing complex partnerships. Resources (time, finances, and people) Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources and the investment of time to support\ncommunity policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained and\neffective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency\nincluding recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from sworn officers to\ncivilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be aligned with the agencies\u2019\ncommunity policing values. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment,\nselection, and hiring processes.",

Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment,\nselection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving\nresponsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service, not just a spirit of\nadventure. A community policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it looks for recruits, whom it is\nrecruiting and hiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community involvement in\nthis process through the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. 63 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Personnel supervision/evaluations\nSupervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are\nincorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional procedures should support sound\nproblem-solving activities, proactive policing, community collaboration, and citizen satisfaction with police\nservices. Training\nTraining at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles and tactics. It\nalso needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to identify\nand correct conditions that could lead to crime, raise public awareness, and engage the community in finding\nsolutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving\nand help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized\nwithin the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information technology systems\nCommunity policing is highly information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in providing ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their patrol beat. In\naddition, technological enhancements can greatly assist with accessing information to provide vital resources,\nimproving two-way communication with citizens, and developing agency accountability systems and\nperformance outcome measures. Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the public\nand internally within their organization. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages\nagencies to develop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports; reverse\n911; e-mail alerts; Internet social media discussion forums; and feedback on interactive applications (such as\nsurveys and geographical information), thereby creating open, ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters, e-mail and\nenhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other entities for\nmore efficient operations.

The\nguidance provides recommendations to award recipients seeking funding for interoperable emergency\ncommunications projects, including allowable costs, items to consider when funding emergency\ncommunications projects, awards management best practices for emergency communications awards, and\ninformation on standards that ensure greater interoperability. The guidance is intended to ensure that federally\nfunded investments are compatible and support national goals and objectives for improving interoperability\nnationwide. Recipients (including sub-recipients) that are using CPD funds to support emergency\ncommunications activities should comply with the latest version of SAFECOM Guidance, including provisions on\ntechnical standards that ensure and enhance interoperable communications. The most recent version of\nSAFECOM guidance is available at www.safecomprogram.gov/grant/Default.aspx. Quality and accuracy of data\nInformation is only as good as its source; therefore, it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information from various\nsources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked to one another and\nchecked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance\nmeasurement. Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must\nbe infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think\ninnovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A\nmajor conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way\nis the SARA (scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the\nscope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the\nselected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents\nsimilar in one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of\nbehavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with\ninput from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. 65 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process.",

The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding\nof the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish\ncorrelation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to\nfind out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?, when?, where?,\nhow?, why?, and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem. The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem or reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but\nalso gathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process,\noutcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis\nshould be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and\ntested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear, meaning that additional scanning,\nanalysis, or responses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for example,\ncapable guardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders (e.g.,\nparents, friends, and probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees, and\nmotel clerks). Rather than focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the police focus on the\nfactors that are within their reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing\nguardianship, and associating risk with unwanted behavior. 66 2016 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Appendix D.
