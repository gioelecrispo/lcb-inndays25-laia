The 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) is designed to\nadvance public safety by providing funds to state law enforcement agencies with high rates of primary treatment\nadmissions for heroin and other opioids. This AHTF funding must be used for investigative purposes to locate or\ninvestigate, through statewide collaboration, illicit activities, including activities related to the distribution of\nheroin or unlawful distribution of prescriptive opioids and unlawful diversion and distribution of prescriptive\nopioids. The allowable uses of your agency\u2019s AHTF award are specified on the AHTF Financial Clearance Memorandum\n(FCM).",

If your agency\u2019s local fiscal conditions have changed since submitting the FY 2017 AHTF application and\nyour agency wishes to modify its AHTF award to reprogram awarded funding into different funding categories,\nplease refer to the award conditions of this manual for detailed information on requesting a post-award\nmodification. This AHTF Award Owner\u2019s Manual will assist your agency with the administrative and financial matters associated\nwith your award. It was developed by the COPS Office to ensure that all AHTF recipients clearly understand and\nmeet the requirements of their award. Please review this manual carefully because a failure to follow award\nrequirements can have serious ramifications. Please do not hesitate to call the COPS Office Response Center at\n800-421-6770 if you need assistance with the implementation of your award. Please note that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is retiring the current Summary Reporting System (SRS)\nand will transition to an all-National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data collection system within the\nnext five years. The transition to NIBRS will provide a more complete and accurate picture of crime at the national,\nstate, and local level. Beginning in 2021, the FBI will no longer collect summary data and will only accept data in\nthe NIBRS format, and COPS Office awards will be based on submitted NIBRS data. Transitioning all law\nenforcement agencies to NIBRS is the first step in gathering more comprehensive crime data. The COPS Office\nencourages its award recipients to submit NIBRS data to the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division in a\ntimely manner, thereby ensuring sufficient and complete crime and arrest data is available for consideration. For\nmore information regarding NIBRS reporting, please see https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/nibrs-overview. Thank you for providing us with the opportunity to work in partnership with your community. 1 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual I.

If the law enforcement or government official\nhas changed since the time of application, please have the current law enforcement executive or government\nexecutive for your agency create an account through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link, log in, and sign the award\ndocument once your agency contacts have been updated online. Once you have reviewed your award document,\nplease electronically sign it and make a copy of all pages of the document for your records, along with all award\ncondition pages, within 90 days of the date shown on the award congratulatory letter. Please see \u201cAccepting the\naward\u201d in this manual. The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed for any\nallowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your AHTF award is two years (24 months). Your award number is in the following format: 2017-HPWX-0000 for awards funded in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. The\nCOPS Office tracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency\u2019s\naward number (or your agency\u2019s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If your agency does not have an ORI number assigned by the FBI, the COPS Office assigns a\nnonofficial ORI code to use as an agency identifier (in such cases, the last two characters will be \u201cZZ\u201d). If you have\nany questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your agency\u2019s ORI number when you\ncontact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency\u2019s nine- or thirteendigit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP vendor\nnumber differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for administrative\npurposes in connection with this program, and should not be used for IRS purposes. 2 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Award terms and conditions The award terms and conditions are listed on your agency\u2019s award document. By accepting this award, you are\nobtaining federal funds from the COPS Office. As part of that agreement, your agency acknowledges that it will\ncomply with the terms and conditions (and, if applicable, additional special or high risk conditions specific to your\nagency).

Why this condition:\nAlthough the COPS Office has made every effort to simplify the process of applying for and receiving awards,\nseveral provisions of federal law require us to obtain the recipient\u2019s signed Assurances and Certifications regarding\ncertain matters. Most of the Assurances and Certifications apply to all federal award programs. What you should do:\nApplicants to COPS Office award programs are required to sign the Assurances and Certifications forms at the time\nof application and application update. Signing these documents assures the COPS Office that you have read,\nunderstood, and accepted the award terms and conditions outlined in the Assurances and Certifications.

The Financial\nClearance Memorandum FCM specifies the costs that your agency is allowed to fund with your AHTF award, and\nspecifies the overall amount approved for each budget request category. Your agency may not use AHTF award\nfunds for any costs that are not identified as allowable in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Only actual\nallowable costs incurred during the award period will be eligible for reimbursement and drawdown. If your agency\nexperiences any cost savings over the course of the award (for example, your award application overestimated the\ntotal entry-level officer salary and fringe benefits package), your agency may not use that excess funding to extend\nthe length of the award beyond 24 months. Any funds remaining after your agency has drawn down for the costs\napproved during the 24 month funding period will be deobligated during the closeout process, and should not be\nspent by your agency.

In other words, recipients may not use COPS Office funds to\nsupplant (replace) state, local, or BIA funds that would have been dedicated to the COPS Office-funded item(s) in\nthe absence of the COPS Office award (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796dd-3(a)). Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds not be used to replace state or\nlocal funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made available for the\naward purposes. What you should do:\nAHTF funds may not be used to pay for any item or cost funded under the award (equipment, personnel, training,\netc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA funds. In addition, recipients may not\nreallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within the law enforcement budget to another as a result of\nreceiving AHTF award funds. If you have questions concerning this award term and how it pertains to your project\nbudget please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. Personnel To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Each individual employed under the COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force program award is newly hired on or\nafter the award start date, unless an exception is authorized in writing by the COPS Office. If current\npersonnel are redeployed into this program, they must be paid with local funds. The COPS Office award funds\nmay be used to backfill the resulting vacancy with newly hired personnel for an equivalent amount of time. \u2022 Any officer(s) or civilian(s) that you are hiring bring(s) your force not only to a number over and above the\nnumber of funded positions that you had on the date of your COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program\napplication (including funded but vacant positions) but also over and above the number of locally funded\npositions during the award period. \u2022 During the life of your award, you must continue to hire as many new, locally funded officers or civilians as\nyou would have if you had not received your award. You may not cancel or postpone spending money in your\nbudget that is committed to hiring other new officers or civilians. \u2022",

Example: If you are redeploying a current employee who would otherwise be paid $75,000 in salary and benefits\nduring the life of the award project, your agency must continue to pay this employee with local funds. The COPS\nOffice award funds may be used to backfill the resulting vacancy with a new hire, even though the COPS Officefunded position will not be working directly on the COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force program. 8 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Equipment and technology To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Equipment and technology must be purchased on or after the award start date (unless an exception is\nauthorized in writing by the COPS Office) and must be in addition to purchases that the recipient is obligated\nor funded to make in the current budget. Funds currently allocated to purchase equipment or technology\nmay not be reallocated to other purposes or reimbursed upon the award of a COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task\nForce program award. For example, a recipient who has budgeted local funds to pay for a new computer\nsystem may not reallocate those funds to pay for any other law enforcement cost as a result of receiving\nAHTF funds for the same computer system. Overtime To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Sworn officer overtime exceeds expenditures that you are obligated or funded to pay in the current budget. Funds currently allocated to pay for overtime may not be reallocated to other purposes or reimbursed upon\nthe award of a COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force program award. Additionally, by the conditions of this\naward, you are required to track all overtime funded through the COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force\nprogram. Training To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Any training provided by the COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force program is in addition to the number of\nhours of training already provided by your agency. Funds currently allocated for training may not be\nreallocated to other purposes. Note: This award condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your agency\nunder this award. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any state or locally funded partnership agencies use\nCOPS Office funds only to supplement, not supplant, their state or local funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding.",

      "content": "5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 24 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 24 months will be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted nocost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays, or other\ncircumstances that interrupt the 24 month award funding period. An extension allows your agency to compensate\nfor such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 24 months of funding. Extension requests must be\nreceived prior to the end date of the award. 9 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days before the award end date. Requests to extend the award period must be submitted online and received by the COPS Office before the official\naward end date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will only be considered when the recipient\nprovides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance where an\nunforeseen natural disaster prevented a recipient from requesting an extension. Failure to submit a request for a\nno-cost time extension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. All extension requests require review and approval by the COPS Office. Individual or cumulative requests greater\nthan one-half of the award\u2019s original term (i.e., 12 months) will require additional justification and must include a\ndetailed timeline. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the award due to salary and fringe benefits costs that were\nlower than anticipated, your agency cannot extend the 24-month funding period for the purpose of expending\nthose excess funds. Recipients are entitled to a maximum of 24 months of federal funding based on the approved\nsalary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining award funds during the\ncloseout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time extension, please contact your\nCOPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency\u2019s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS Office\nAHTF award. Award modifications under AHTF are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All modification requests\ninvolving the purchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their\nimplementation.",

All modification requests\ninvolving the purchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their\nimplementation. In addition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that\nresults in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may expend award funds only\nas approved in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Any requests to change or alter awards require written\napproval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue\nto implement your award as it was originally awarded and accepted by your agency. Please be advised that\nreprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be approved (construction, indirect costs, etc.). 10 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What you should do: For all other modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link in\nthe upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office, providing the proposed changes,\ndetails of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific award modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified award may begin\nfollowing written approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for active awards will\noften be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes. If applicable, your agency\nis required to sign and submit the modified award document via the \u201cAccount Access\u201d tab to officially accept the\naward modification. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of its award programs. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may be\ncarried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine what programs are working, how programs may be improved, and why\ncertain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which your\nagency implements its AHTF award. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff members or evaluators may study the\neffectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the programs\u2019\neffect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask questions about\nthe challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel about community policing, and\nhow police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other communities and police agencies across\nthe country. What you should do:",

What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your department, observe activities, and obtain written\nreports about and from your department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and information-gathering\nactivities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information about your award activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports that track actual expenditures of allowable costs using\n11 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is used to track your agency\u2019s progress toward implementing\ncommunity policing strategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency\u2019s community\npolicing capacity through COPS Office funding. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure the proper\nuse of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress of our\nprograms and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with AHTF\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link of the COPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within\n30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the award\nperiod. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period and the\nremaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw\ndown federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however, you will have a 90-day grace\nperiod after the award end date during which you can draw down funds for eligible expenditures incurred before\nthe award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic or financial report submission per\nfiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to\nreceive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in\nthe section \u201cReports\u201d in this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid\nsuspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required reports\nmay also impact future funding opportunities.",

Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of award implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring\nprocess coordinated by the US Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office\ninclude site visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic\nreporting, and audit resolution. As a COPS Office award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any\nrequests for information pertaining to your award. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain a\nmonitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are complying with COPS Office award\nrequirements. In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance to help\nensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards. 12 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and nonroutine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds, both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients\u2019 compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to\nconduct site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is\nthreefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare\nfor the review of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period of one or\nmore days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while onsite or, if necessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an opportunity to seek\ncustomer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an\nEOBGR conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an\nalternative for conducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall award\nmonitoring strategy. The purpose of the EOBGR is threefold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance",

In addition,\naward recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many\nsources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office\nFinance Division, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a\nnoncompliance issue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous\ncomplainants, media, citizens, law enforcement agencies, other Federal agencies, or other outside\nsources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of\naction to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter\ncontact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the OIG. Each ANCR referral is resolved as a violation or\nnonviolation based upon the preponderance of the supporting documentation or other facts to determine\nif the award recipient is in compliance or noncompliance. Audit liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event\nyour agency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with your\nagency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may include\n13 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual repayment of award funds, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance, or providing\nproof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the causes for the\nnoncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award funds,\nor a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time. Under certain conditions, additional\nactions may include referral and placement on the US Department of Justice\u2019s High Risk List, which will include\nmandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training and being subject to\nincreased monitoring of current and future awards while on the list.",

In the event of criminal misuse of award\nfunds, recipients may also be subject to fines and imprisonment. To avoid findings of noncompliance, recipients\nare strongly encouraged to become familiar with the COPS Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Grant Monitoring\nStandards and Guidelines and with the Award Owner\u2019s Manual for the year in which the award is awarded. Recipients should also contact the COPS Office or their Grant Program Specialist at any time during the life of a\nCOPS Office award with questions concerning award conditions, terms, or requirements to seek guidance to avoid\nnoncompliance. It is necessary for recipients to maintain all relevant documentation (administrative, financial, and\nprogrammatic) used to develop the application and implement the award that may be necessary or required to\ndemonstrate award compliance. For more information, please contact the COPS Office Response Center at 800421-6770 or at AskCopsRC@usdoj.gov. 10. Federal Civil Rights\nCondition: As a condition of receipt of federal financial assistance, you acknowledge and agree that you will not (and will\nrequire any subrecipient, contractors, successors, transferees, and assignees not to), on the grounds of race, color,\nreligion, national origin, sex, or disability unlawfully exclude any person from participation in, deny the benefits of,\nor employment to any person, or subject any person to discrimination in connection with any programs or\nactivities funded in whole or in part with federal funds. You will also not discriminate in the delivery of benefits or\nservices based on age. These civil rights requirements are found in the nondiscrimination provisions of Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d); the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of\n1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3789d); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794);\nthe Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6101); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\nas amended (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681); and the corresponding US Department of Justice regulations implementing those\nstatutes at 28 C.F.R. Part 42 (subparts C, D, E, G, and I). You also agree to comply with Executive Order 13279, as\namended by Executive Order 13559, and the implementing regulations at 28 C.F.R Part 38, Partnerships With\nFaith-Based and Other Neighborhood Organizations, which requires equal treatment of religious organizations in\nthe funding process and prohibits religious discrimination against beneficiaries. 14 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition: In establishing financial assistance programs, Congress linked the receipt of federal funding to compliance with\nfederal civil rights laws.

A hold may be placed on your award if it is deemed that your\nagency is not in compliance with federal civil rights laws or is not cooperating with an ongoing federal civil rights\ninvestigation. If a hold is placed on your award, you will not be able to obligate or draw down federal funds under\nyour agency\u2019s COPS Office award until you comply with federal civil rights laws or cooperate with any ongoing\nfederal civil rights investigation. What you should do:\nIncluded with your award package is a memorandum from the Office for Civil Rights, Office of Justice Programs, US\nDepartment of Justice, which addresses the Federal civil rights statutes and regulations applicable to your award. You should review this memorandum to understand your agency\u2019s civil rights responsibilities. As a recipient of federal financial assistance from the COPS Office, you are required to comply with the applicable\nfederal civil rights laws and to collect data and information sufficient to permit effective enforcement of such laws\nand to cooperate with any federal civil rights investigation, which includes providing access to records, accounts,\ndocuments, information, facilities, and staff. 11. Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP)\nCondition: All recipients of funding from the COPS Office must comply with the federal regulations pertaining to the\ndevelopment and implementation of an Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (28 C.F.R. Part 42 subpart E). Why this condition: It is the experience of the US Department of Justice in implementing its responsibilities under the Omnibus Crime\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act), the statute that funds the COPS Office, that \u201cthe full and\nequal participation of women and minority individuals in employment opportunities in the criminal justice system\nis a necessary component to the Safe Streets Act\u2019s program to reduce crime and delinquency in the United States\u201d\n(28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.301). EEOPs do not impose quotas or hiring requirements on recipients. What you should do: The obligations to comply with the EEOP requirement differ depending on your organization\u2019s legal status, the\nnumber of its employees, and the amount of the award. If your organization is a government agency or private business and has received a single award for $25,000 or\nmore and has fifty or more employees (counting both full- and part-time employees but excluding political\nappointees), then it has to prepare a Utilization Report and submit it to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within 120\ndays from the date of the award. Although the OCR has discretion to review all submitted Utilization Reports, it will\nreview the Utilization Reports from recipients that receive an award of $500,000 or more. 15 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual To begin developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nhttps://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click EEOP Reporting Tool Login.",

Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and subaward information and\nthe award term provides guidance to report the related information, as required by FFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and systems\nin place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements should it\nreceive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required to report award information\non any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to report information on the names and\ntotal compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the Internet at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool\nthat your agency will use to capture and report subaward information and any executive compensation data\nrequired by FFATA. The subaward information entered in FSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov\nassociated with your agency\u2019s award, furthering federal spending transparency.

Administrative proceeding means a nonjudicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to\nmake a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission\nAdministrative proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals proceedings, and Armed Services\nBoard of Contract Appeals proceedings). This includes proceedings at the Federal and State level\n27 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual b. c. but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or award. It does not include\naudits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables.

Computer Network Requirement\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees that no award funds may be used to maintain or establish a computer\nnetwork unless such network blocks the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. Nothing in this\nrequirement limits the use of funds necessary for any federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any\nother entity carrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. 29 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition:\nSection 532 of Division B, Title V, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (Pub. L. 115-31) prohibits the use of\nfederal funds to maintain or establish a computer network that does not block the viewing, downloading, and\nexchanging of pornography. This provision protects the public interest in the proper management and use of\nfederal funds. What you should do: The recipient must not use award funds to maintain or establish a computer network unless the network blocks\npornography. This does not limit the use of funds for criminal investigations, prosecution or adjudication activities. 26.

Therefore, the recipient must use the AHTF award funding to benefit its own service population. What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the AHTF award cannot provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies unless\nthey will directly benefit the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, a sheriff\u2019s department cannot use an AHTFfunded officer to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but can use the AHTF-funded\nofficer to provide direct law enforcement services to towns within its own county. 27. Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using AHTF funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. The recipient acknowledges that it has completed, signed, and submitted\nthe Reviews and Certifications form with its award application certifying compliance with 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found in 28 C.F.R. Part 23. An\ninterjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system that receives, stores, analyzes, and\nexchanges or disseminates data regarding ongoing pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling, 30 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual bribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems which protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use AHTF program funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms\nof technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not\napply to this award. What you should do:\nAll AHTF recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence Systems/28 C.F.R. Part 23 as part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to use their award\nfunds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use award funds to\noperate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should have indicated this in your application and\ncertified your agency\u2019s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Your agency\nnow must comply with 28 C.F.R. Part 23 in operating the inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system funded\nthrough your AHTF award. 28. Sole Source Justification\nCondition:\nRecipients who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group of items) or service in excess\nof $150,000 and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement process must provide a\nwritten sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating, expending, or drawing down\naward funds for that item or service. Why this condition: In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in some\ninstances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible.",

For assistance with financial management and award administration, please contact the COPS Office\nResponse Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one payment system available for accessing federal award funds\u2014the Grant Payment Request\nSystem (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables recipients to use a secure Internet connection to request\nfunds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States Department\nof the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the primary system\nthat agencies use for EFT. An award recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made since July\n2009. For more information regarding GPRS, please visit the following website to view the GPRS User Guide\nwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm. Setting up your account How do we set up a GPRS account? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s) will be\nresponsible for requesting federal funds from your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The individual(s)\nselected must click on the following link and register with the GPRS system to become a drawdown specialist for\nyour agency: https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome. Once you have been approved, you will receive an email containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement\nexecutive and/or government executive or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process. All individuals who need access to GPRS must register separately and\ncreate their own unique GPRS username account, as these accounts are not meant to be shared. How do we add an award to an existing GPRS account? If you are currently registered for an active COPS Office award username in GPRS and would like to add a recently\nawarded COPS Office award to your existing COPS Office award username, contact the COPS Office GPRS\nregistration team via email at COPSGPRSRegistration@usdoj.gov and provide the following information:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 User name (for COPS Office awards) First/last name\nVendor number (as listed on your award document)\nAward number(s) to be added 36",

If you are a new award recipient to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment enrollment form (SF-3881). This form can be found on the\nCOPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/ach_form_new.pdf. Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 Seventh Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 Your agency must complete the \u201cPayee/Company Information\u201d section following the directions on the back of the\nform and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial institution must\ncomplete the \u201cFinancial Institution Information\u201d section and have the appropriate financial official sign the form. If you are already a COPS Office award recipient, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long as\nyour OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment form\ninformation, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Staff Accountant. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? Current regulations state that once you return a signed award document, your agency is required to submit a\nFederal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) at the end of every calendar quarter regardless of\naward activity. This report should reflect actual expenditures and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency\non a cumulative basis. You will not be able to make drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 report for\nthe most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Recipients are\nencouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov.\u201d For more information on how to complete, and where to submit your quarterly SF-425 report, see the section of\nthis manual titled \u201cReports\u201d. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. 37 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove.

How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements; however, your reimbursement\nrequests should cover a specific time frame and include only costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM). As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once. Can we earn interest on our award funds? For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified at 31\nC.F.R.

For nonfederal entities other than states, payment methods must minimize the time between your drawdown of\nfederal funds and your payment of award costs to avoid earning excess interest on your award funds. You must\naccount for interest earned on advances of federal funds as follows:\n\u2022 The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance at 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.305(b)(9) states that\ninterest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year\nmay be retained by the nonfederal entity for administrative expenses. \u2022 Any interest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts that is in excess of\n$500 per year must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment\nManagement System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nnetwork or a Fedwire Funds Service payment.

Financial Record Maintenance Under the COPS Office AHTF program, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems and\nfinancial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include both federal\nfunds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for\nthe funds awarded. As required by 2 C.F.R. 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your accounting\nsystem should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the following objectives\nfor federal awards:\n\u2022 Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. \u2022 Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. \u2022 Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your AHTF award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, cancelled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your AHTF award (including payroll, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, and purchase orders) must be retained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.333 (Retention requirements for\nrecords). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever you\nfind more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving these records has been\nstarted before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These\nrecords should be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to\nmaintain adequate records to document award expenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds\nthat cannot be supported with appropriate records. 40 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What if we have more than one award?",

If your agency has more than one COPS Office award or an award from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization from the\nCOPS Office, or in the case of an award from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your accounting\nsystems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the US Department of Justice, the Comptroller\nGeneral of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may access these\nrecords for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 41 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual V. Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The\ntwo primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and US Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving federal\nfinancial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on June 26,\n2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and reporting\nrequirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 C.F.R. Part 200\u2014Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) on\nDecember 26, 2013. This guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments awarded on or after\nDecember 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of SAA requirements. 2\nC.F.R. Part 200, Subpart F \u2013 Audit Requirements, available at www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl, establishes the requirements for organizational audits that\napply to COPS Office award recipients. Recipients must arrange for the required organization-wide (not award-byaward) audit in accordance with the requirements of Subpart F. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.514 Scope of audit except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987 to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit is\nto express opinions on the recipient\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and nonmajor award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations.",

In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, federal\nagencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.338 - Remedies for\nnoncompliance. See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.505. These sanctions under \u00a7200.338 could include the following:\n\u2022 Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or more\nsevere enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. \u2022 Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the\nactivity or action not in compliance. \u2022 Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the federal award. 42 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual \u2022 Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 C.F.R. part 180 and federal awarding\nagency regulations (or in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding be initiated by a\nfederal awarding agency). \u2022 Withhold further federal awards for the project or program.\n\u2022 Take other remedies that may be legally available.

Questions and comments regarding SAA audits may be\ndirected to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the OIG for award audits? The OIG is a separate component of the US Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits are\ndesigned to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believed warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on an\nannual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the\nOIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the geographical distribution of\nawards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and expired), and type of award (hiring\nand non-hiring).",

The COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Audit Liaison Section serves as the liaison between recipients and the\nOIG\u2019s Audit Division, which conducts the audit. The OIG steps in the audit process will determine the interactions\nbetween the OIG, the recipient, and the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section:\n\u2022 Call for award data. The OIG requests award documentation from the COPS Office. \u2022 Entrance conference. The OIG schedules to meet with the recipient to gather documentation and conduct\naudit. \u2022 Draft audit report. The OIG reviews documentation and presents initial findings to the recipient and copies\nthe COPS Office. The COPS Office interacts with the recipient to coordinate any repayments and/or policy or\nprocedure documents to be submitted to the OIG before release of the Final Audit Report. \u2022 Final audit report. The OIG has completed its direct interaction with the recipient. The COPS Office directs\nthe recipient to formulate a Corrective Action Plan to address recommendations (findings). As each\nrecommendation is successfully addressed by the recipient, the COPS Office requests closure on the\nrecommendation. \u2022 Closing the audit. When all recommendations have been closed, the COPS Office requests closure on the\naudit from the OIG and notifies the recipient that the audit is closed.

Weaknesses are identified in a recipient\u2019s accounting practices, fiscal stewardship,\naccuracy of data used in the development of the award applications, and/or inventory controls that led to the\nrecommendation cited in the audit. The recipient is required to develop or revise policies and/or procedures\nconsistent with their existing practices and submit to the COPS Office to forward to the OIG to close the\nrecommendation. \u2022 Failure to retain. Recipient lacked documentation to support retention planning efforts during the award\nperiod and/or failed to demonstrate an increase in the baseline of locally-funded sworn officer positions at\nthe conclusion of the 36 months of federal funding, over and above what the recipient would have funded in\nabsence of the award. \u2022 Supplanting. Recipient could not document efforts to backfill vacant local sworn officer positions, or recipient\ncould not explain reductions in local law enforcement budget or in sworn officer positions during the award\nperiod. \u2022 Lack of adequate community policing. Recipient had difficulty demonstrating community policing activities. After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division will continue working\nas the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The COPS Office will issue\na closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must keep all documentation\nrelated to the audit for a period of three years following the audit\u2019s closure. 45 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual VI. Reports As an AHTF award recipient, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report AHTF program\nfunding separately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal awards) to ensure accurate\nfinancial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial internal\ncontrols in place to monitor the use of AHTF funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms and\nconditions.",

Good stewardship in this area would include written accounting practices, use of an accounting system\nthat tracks all award drawdowns and expenditures, and the ability to track when award-funded positions are filled\nor vacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit complete reports or submit\nthem in a timely manner may result in the suspension and possible termination of your agency\u2019s COPS Office award\nfunding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit a quarterly Federal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the\naward period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period\nand the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to\ndraw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however, you will have a 90-day\ngrace period after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred\nbefore the award end date.

When the Award Period Has Ended At the end of your agency\u2019s AHTF award period, the COPS Office is responsible for the closeout of your award. As\npart of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation demonstrating that your agency has met all of the\nfinancial and programmatic requirements of the award. After the end of the award period, your agency will be asked to submit a Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425)\nand any applicable final programmatic progress reports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) for your award is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after the\nend date of the award period. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal expenditures\nthat were incurred during the life of the award (as stated in the OMB Uniform Guidance 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.77 Period of\nperformance), as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. In addition, once you have completed\nyour final drawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of federal funds drawn down by your\nagency. The final SF-425 report should also reflect the total amount of the local cash match (if required) contributed over\nthe 36-month award period, which should be at least 25 percent of the total award project, unless waived by the\nCOPS Office in writing. The federal funds expended should reflect only the actual allowable incurred salary and\nfringe benefit costs for the 36-month award period that each award position was occupied. When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency has incurred but not\nyet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the award period to request reimbursement for funds\nobligated. Please be advised that 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.343(a) requires recipients to submit final SF-425s and 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.343(b)\nrequires recipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of\nthe award. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess award funds remaining in your account following the award period\ndue to an overestimate of item costs during the award period. Your agency should review its records carefully to\nensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred during the award\nperiod. Any excess unobligated or unspent funds should remain in your account, and will be deobligated during the\ncloseout process. 50 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Final Program Progress (Closeout) Report",

      "content": "Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1.\n2.\n3. Community partnerships\nOrganizational transformation\nProblem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the individuals\nand organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages interactive\npartnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these partnerships can be\nused to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through collaborative problem\nsolving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and addressing public safety\nproblems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify community\nconcerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies, prosecutors, probation\nand parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies, health and human\nservices departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific goals at\ntown hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the community,\nand team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its behalf\ncan be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share common\ninterests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups, advocacy\ngroups, community development corporations, and the faith community. 61 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because they\noften bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify\nproblems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and community\noutreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating information about\npolice-business partnerships and initiatives, and crime prevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community agencies\nor new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on public\nperceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how the\ninfrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages the\napplication of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the entire\ndepartment, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology.

Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the entire\ndepartment, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem solving\nand partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and communication that\ntake place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of doing business. 62 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part of\nthe process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor groups\nin agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing implementation. Decision-making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision-making. Decentralized\ndecision-making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision-making\ninvolves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving efforts, and\nallowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various\nresources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community\nwill help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan is to\nhave value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their\nefforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and values statement should be\nsimple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures,\nwhere appropriate. Organizational evaluations",

Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures,\nwhere appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime rates)\ncommunity policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include greater community satisfaction,\nless fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a\nmore sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks not only at measured outcomes, but also at how\nfeedback information is used. Transparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the\ncommunity is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant information on\ncrime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. 63 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local patrol officers have decisionmaking authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term assignments, the\ndevelopment of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or\nareas. Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components can help enhance customer service\nand facilitate more contact between police and citizens, thus establishing strong relationships and mutual\naccountability. Patrol beat boundaries should be aligned to neighborhood boundaries to enhance officers\u2019\nunderstanding of communities within their patrol areas and to build trust within the community. Other community\npolicing partners should become familiar with both the patrol officers and community policing officers assigned\nwithin each patrol beat to coordinate government and nongovernment community policing activities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, the culture of policing should strive to have officers have to be able to\nhandle multiple responsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the\ncommunity. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just by special units, although there\nmay be a need for specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly complex problems or\nmanaging complex partnerships. Resources (time, finances, and people) Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources and the investment of time to support\ncommunity policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained and\neffective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency\nincluding recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from sworn officers to\ncivilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be aligned with the agencies\u2019\ncommunity policing values.

It\nalso needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained to identify and\ncorrect conditions that could lead to crime, raise public awareness, and engage the community in finding solutions\nto problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving and help\nofficers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized within the\norganization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information technology systems\nCommunity policing is highly information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in providing ready access to\nquality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective and ensures\nthat officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their patrol beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with accessing information to provide vital resources, improving\ntwo-way communication with citizens, and developing agency accountability systems and performance outcome\nmeasures. Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the public and\ninternally within their organization. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages agencies to\ndevelop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports; reverse 911; email\nalerts; Internet social media discussion forums; and feedback on interactive applications (such as surveys and\ngeographical information), thereby creating open, ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters, email and\nenhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other entities for more\nefficient operations. Community policing also encourages the use of technology to develop accountability and\nperformance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a broad array of measures\nand information. Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely information\non crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers in their patrol cars or\nthrough personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem analysis functions by enabling\nagencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime locations, and quality-of-life\nconcerns, and to further enhance analysis. 65",

The guidance\nprovides recommendations to award recipients seeking funding for interoperable emergency communications\nprojects, including allowable costs, items to consider when funding emergency communications projects, awards\nmanagement best practices for emergency communications awards, and information on standards that ensure\ngreater interoperability. The guidance is intended to ensure that federally funded investments are compatible and\nsupport national goals and objectives for improving interoperability nationwide. Recipients (including subrecipients) that are using CPD funds to support emergency communications activities should comply with the latest\nversion of SAFECOM Guidance, including provisions on technical standards that ensure and enhance interoperable\ncommunications. The most recent version of SAFECOM guidance is available at\nwww.safecomprogram.gov/grant/Default.aspx. Quality and accuracy of data\nInformation is only as good as its source; therefore, it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information from various\nsources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked to one another and\nchecked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance\nmeasurement. Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions\nto the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused\ninto all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about\ntheir responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A major conceptual\nvehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way is the SARA\n(scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the\nscope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the\nselected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents similar\nin one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a\nplace, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from\nthe community, should identify and prioritize concerns. 66 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process.",

The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding of\nthe dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish correlation,\nand develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to find out as much\nas possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?, when?, where?, how?, why?, and why\nnot? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an identified\nproblem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response should follow\nlogically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific problem. The goals\nof the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially reducing the problem or\nreducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of community cohesion. Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but also\ngathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process, outcomes,\nor both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis should be\nreviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and tested. The\nentire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear, meaning that additional scanning, analysis, or\nresponses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim, offender,\nand location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for example, capable\nguardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders (e.g., parents, friends,\nand probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees, and motel clerks). Rather\nthan focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the police focus on the factors that are within\ntheir reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating\nrisk with unwanted behavior. 67 2017 COPS Office Anti-Heroin Task Force Program (AHTF) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Appendix D.
