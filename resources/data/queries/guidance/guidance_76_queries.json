In addition,\nawardees may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds from one area within the law enforcement budget to\nanother as a result of receiving CAGI award funds. If you have questions concerning this award term, and\nhow it pertains to your project budget, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. Personnel To meet this grant condition, you must ensure the following: \u2022 Each individual employed under the COPS Anti-Gang Initiative grant is newly hired on or after the\ngrant award start date, unless an exception is authorized in writing by the COPS Office. If current\npersonnel are redeployed into this program, they must be paid with local funds. The COPS Office\ngrant funds may be used to backfill the resulting vacancy with newly hired personnel for an\nequivalent amount of time. \u2022 Any officer(s) or civilian(s) that you are hiring bring(s) your force not only to a number over and above the number of funded positions that you had on the date of your COPS Anti-Gang\nInitiative application (including funded but vacant positions) but also over and above the number\nof locally funded positions during the grant award period. \u2022 During the life of your grant, you must continue to hire as many new, locally funded officers or civilians as you would have if you had not received your grant. You may not cancel or postpone\nspending money in your budget that is committed to hiring other new officers or civilians. \u2022 You must take expeditious and timely steps to fill any vacancies that were created on or after the\ndate of your grant application by retirement, resignation, or other reasons with new officers or\ncivilians other than your COPS Anti-Gang Initiative positions. Example: If you are redeploying a current employee who would otherwise be paid $75,000 in salary and\nbenefits during the life of the grant project, your agency must continue to pay this employee with local\nfunds.

Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any state or locally funded partnership\nagencies use COPS Office funds only to supplement, not supplant, their state or local funding as described\nin this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the grant award period to receive additional time to implement your\ngrant program. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Grants may be extended a maximum of 24\nmonths beyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 24 months will be evaluated\non a case-by-case basis. Only those grantees that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted\nno-cost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays,\nor other circumstances that interrupt the 24-month grant funding period. An extension allows your agency to\ncompensate for such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 24 months of funding. Extension\nrequests must be received prior to the end date of the award. Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the grant award period require prior written approval from the\nCOPS Office. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding\nfor costs incurred beyond the official grant award end date.

What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the grant award period to determine\nwhether a no-cost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the grant\nend date. Requests to extend the grant award period must be submitted online and received by the COPS\nOffice before the official grant award end date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will\nonly be considered when the grantee provides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example\nof this would be an instance where an unforeseen natural disaster prevented a grantee from requesting\nan extension. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension by the end date may result in the\nimmediate deobligation of any remaining grant funds. 9 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual Automatic extensions will be granted for grantee requests of six months or less. All extension requests\nbeyond six months will require review and approval by the COPS Office. Individual or cumulative requests\ngreater than one-half of the grant\u2019s original term (i.e., 12 months) will require additional justification and\nmust include a detailed timeline. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the grant due to salary and fringe benefits costs that\nwere lower than anticipated, your agency cannot extend the 24-month funding period for the purpose of\nexpending those excess funds. Grantees are entitled to a maximum of 24 months of federal funding based\non the approved salary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining\ngrant funds during the closeout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time\nextension, please contact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency\u2019s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS AntiGang Initiative award. Grant modifications under CAGI are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. All modification\nrequests involving the purchase of new budget items must be approved, in writing, by the COPS Office prior to their\nimplementation. In addition, please be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that\nresults in an increase of federal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram grant funds. Acceptable examples of such\naward modifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items,\nor purchasing a different type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you may\nexpend grant funds only as approved in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Any requests to change or\nalter grant awards require written approval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Without\nprior written approval, you must continue to implement your grant as it was originally awarded and\naccepted by your agency. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved (construction, indirect costs, etc.).",

Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved (construction, indirect costs, etc.). What you should do: For all other modifications, your agency must access www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d\nlink in the upper right corner to log in and submit your request to the COPS Office through the Grants\nManagement Portal, providing the proposed changes, details of why the change is needed, etc. For additional information about the process for submitting your specific grant modification request, please\ncontact your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist at 800-421-6770. The COPS Office will then evaluate your\nrequest and notify your agency of our decision in writing. Implementation of the modified grant award\nmay begin following written approval from the COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for\nactive grants will often be accompanied by a modified award document reflecting the approved changes. If applicable, your agency is required to sign and submit the modified award document via the \u201cAccount\nAccess\u201d link to officially accept the grant modification. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of the COPS Anti-Gang Initiative. The\ngrantee agrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. 10 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program\nmay be carried out or commissioned by the Attorney General for the furtherance of the purposes of the\nAct. The COPS Office conducts evaluations to determine what programs are working, how programs may\nbe improved, and why certain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may\nassess the way in which your agency implements its CAGI grant. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or\nevaluators may study the effectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect\ninformation about the programs\u2019 effect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In\naddition, they may ask questions about the challenges encountered during project implementation, how\nresidents feel about community policing, and how police feel about their work. This information will be\nuseful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In general, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and\ninformation-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information\nabout your grant activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425).",

Reports/Performance goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). The progress report is\nused to track your agency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing strategies and to collect data to\ngauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity through COPS Office funding. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government be monitored carefully to ensure\nthe proper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the\nprogress of our programs and grantees. What you should do: This grant condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with\nCAGI grants. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report will be\nrequired to be submitted directly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link of the COPS Office\nwebsite at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports\nusing Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will\nbe due within 90 days after the end of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal\nmonies spent, unliquidated obligations incurred, and the unobligated balance of federal funds. Under\nfederal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the\nofficial grant end date; however, you will have a 90-day grace period after the grant award end date during\nwhich you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before the grant end date. Agencies with\nmore than one delinquent programmatic and/or financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject\nto delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses and may be required to receive technical\nassistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail in section VI 11 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual (\u201cReports\u201d) on page 38 of this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid\nsuspension or possible termination of grant funds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required\nreports may also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Grant monitoring activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their grant conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of grant implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring\nprocess coordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Grant monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office\ninclude site visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic\nreporting, and audit resolution. As a COPS Office CAGI grantee, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any\nrequests for information pertaining to your grant.

Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each grant program must\ncontain a monitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how grantees are adhering to COPS\nOffice grant requirements and develops the best technical assistance based on this feedback. What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and non-routine efforts by the COPS Office, or an\nentity designated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds, both programmatically\nand financially. The most common ways are as follows: \u2022 site visits. The COPS Office conducts grantee site visits to ensure compliance with grant terms and conditions. These visits also provide firsthand observation of the grantee\u2019s community\npolicing strategies. The purpose of site visits is three-fold: to review community policing activities,\nto ensure grantee compliance, and to provide customer service and technical assistance. If\nselected, you will be notified in writing in advance of any on-site review of your COPS Office\ngrants. This review is generally performed over a period of one or more days and also provides an\nopportunity for agency representatives to seek assistance on any grant implementation issues. Your agency will be notified in writing of the results and any action required to remedy identified\ngrant violations to include potential and actual vulnerabilities. In addition, promising practices\nidentified during the site visit are documented and may be shared with the law enforcement\ncommunity. \u2022 enhanced office-based grant reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, certain grants are selected for a review conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve\nas a supplemental activity in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall grant monitoring strategy. The\npurpose of the EOBGR is three-fold: to review community policing activities, to ensure grantee\ncompliance, and to provide customer service and technical assistance. If selected, you will be\nnotified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of your COPS Office grants. This review is generally\nperformed over a period of one or more days and also provides an opportunity for agency\nrepresentatives to seek assistance on any grant implementation issues.

In addition, promising practices identified during the\nEOBGR are documented and may be shared with the law enforcement community. \u2022 alleged noncompliance reviews (ANCR) . An alleged noncompliance review is a follow up on complaints of alleged noncompliance received from external (media and/or citizen complaints)\nor internal (COPS Office/DOJ staff ) sources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office staff members\ndetermine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints of alleged\nnoncompliance.

Other compensation, if the aggregate value of all such other compensation (e.g., severance,\ntermination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or\nproperty) for the executive exceeds $10,000. Why this condition: To further federal spending transparency, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006\n(FFATA) requires, among other things, that information on federal awards (federal financial assistance and expenditures) be made available to the public via a single, searchable website, which is www.USASpending.gov. Grantees are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and subaward information\nand the award term provides guidance to report the related information, as required by FFATA. What you should do: At the time of grant application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes\nand systems in place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting\nrequirements should it receive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required\nto report award information on any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to\nreport information on the names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated executives\nof the recipient and first-tier subrecipients. The FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS), accessible via the\nInternet at www.fsrs.gov, is the reporting tool that your agency will use to capture and report subaward 20 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual information and any executive compensation data required by FFATA. The subaward information entered\nin FSRS will then be displayed on www.USASpending.gov associated with your agency\u2019s award, furthering\nfederal spending transparency. For additional information regarding the executive compensation and subaward reporting requirements,\nplease see Vol. 75, No. 177 (September 14, 2010) of the Federal Register, www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-201009-14/pdf/2010-22705.pdf. 18. Criminal intelligence systems\nCondition:\nGrantees using CAGI funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. The grantee acknowledges that it has completed, signed, and submitted\nwith its grant award the relevant Special Condition certifying its compliance with 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R.\nPart 23. An inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system that receives,\nstores, analyzes, and exchanges or disseminates data regarding on-going pre-arrest criminal activities\n(examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking,\ngambling, extortion, smuggling, bribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law\nenforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23 contains operating principles for these inter-jurisdictional criminal\nintelligence systems which protect individual privacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) grant funds simply to operate a single agency\ndatabase (or other unrelated forms of technology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other\njurisdictions, 28 C.F.R.",

Part 23 does not apply to this grant. What you should do:\nAll COPS Office grant recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence\nSystems/28 C.F.R. Part 23 as part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies\nintend to use their award funds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency\nintends to use grant funds to operate an inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should indicate\nthis on the Criminal Intelligence Systems 28 C.F.R. Part 23 Compliance form that was included with your\ngrant award package, and certify and submit this form along with your signed grant award document as\nyour agency\u2019s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R.

Sole source justification\nCondition:\nCAGI awardees who have been awarded funding for the procurement of an item (or group of items) or service in\nexcess of $150,000 and who plan to seek approval for use of a noncompetitive procurement process must provide\na written sole source justification to the COPS Office for approval prior to obligating, expending, or drawing down\naward funds for that item or service. 21 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition: In general, award recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in some instances, awardees may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: If you have received an award for an item (or group of items) or service in excess of $150,000 and have\nalready determined that the award of a contract through a competitive process is infeasible, you must\nprovide a written justification that explains why it is necessary to contract noncompetitively. The initial determination that competition is not feasible can be made if one of the following circumstances\nexists: \u2022 The item (or group of items) or service is available only from a single source\n\u2022 Public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from\ncompetitive solicitation \u2022 Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources The COPS Office will review your request and the supporting information that you provide and will make a\ndetermination as to whether or not an exception can be awarded to the general rule regarding competition. If submitting a sole source justification request to the COPS Office, please use the format described in the\nsole source fact sheet at http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/cpd/sole-source-justification-fact-sheet.pdf. 20.

For assistance with financial management and grant administration, please contact the\nCOPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one method of payment available for accessing federal grant funds\u2014the Grant Payment\nRequest System (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables grantees to use a secure Internet\nconnection to request funds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury. A grantee will be able to review previous requests made since July 2009. For more information on the GPRS, please go to www.ojp.usdoj.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view the\nuser guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a GPRS account? If you are a new grantee to the COPS Office, your law enforcement executive or government executive\nshould receive notification about GPRS shortly after the COPS Office receives your original signed award\ndocument. This notification will contain all of the information that your agency needs to set up the GPRS\npayment method. If your law enforcement executive or government executive does not perform drawdown\nrequests for your agency, your grant administrator will need to go online to https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/ gprs/welcome to log in and register to become a Drawdown Specialist. Once you are approved, you will\nreceive an e-mail containing a temporary password and information on how to use GPRS. Please note that\npart of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement executive or government\nexecutive or other financial points of contact to validate information provided by the Drawdown Specialist.",

If you are a new grantee to the COPS Office, your agency will need to complete an Automated\nClearinghouse (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment (SF-3881) enrollment form. This form can be found on\nthe COPS Office website at the following address: www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=100. Prior to accessing your grant funds, your agency must mail the original signed form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 7th Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 31 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual Your agency must complete the \u201cPayee/Company Information\u201d section following the directions on the\nback of the form and also provide the grant number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial\ninstitution must complete the \u201cFinancial Institution Information\u201d section and have the appropriate financial\nofficial sign the form. If you are already a COPS Office grantee, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the newly awarded\ngrant as long as your OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your\nACH enrollment form information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? After your agency returns the signed award document to the COPS Office, under current regulations, you\nare required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using a Standard Form 425 (SF-425). This report\nreflects the actual monies spent and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency. You will not be able\nto make drawdowns from your grant account if the SF-425 for the most recent reporting quarter is not on\nfile with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Grantees are encouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via\nthe Internet at www.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see section VI of this\nGrant Owner\u2019s Manual, titled \u201cReports,\u201d on page 38. Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that\ncalendar quarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance.

If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office grants. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment\nto ensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal grant funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the grantee\n\u2022 is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\n\u2022 maintains excess cash on hand;\n\u2022 does not adhere to the terms and conditions of the grant;\n\u2022 fails to submit reliable and/or timely reports. How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements. However, reimbursement\nis only for costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance Memorandum (FCM). As a general guideline,\nmost agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly basis. Also, please note that a date range\ncan only be used once. 32 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual Can we earn interest on our grant funds? Your agency should minimize the time between your drawdown of grant funds and your payment of grant\ncosts to avoid earning excess interest on your grant funds. You must account for interest earned on advances\nof federal funds as follows:\n\u2022 COPS grant award recipients must adhere to the standards set forth in the applicable Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.305(b)(9) that states that interest\nearned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year may\nbe retained by the grantee for administrative expense. Interest earned on federal advance payments\ndeposited in interest-bearing accounts in excess of $500 must be remitted annually to the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Make check payable to \u201cThe Department of Health and\nHuman Services\u201d and mail check to treasury approved lockbox: HHS Program Support Center, P.O. Box\n530231, Atlanta, GA 30353-0231.

Financial Record Maintenance Under the COPS Office CAGI grant, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems\nand financial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include\nboth federal funds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately\naccount for the funds awarded. As stated in 2 C.F.R. 200.62 (Internal Control over Compliance Requirements for Federal Awards), your\naccounting system should\n\u2022 present and itemize actual expenditures of funded items;\n\u2022 demonstrate that funds are spent in compliance with your grant conditions;\n\u2022 be able to provide the necessary information for periodic financial review and audit. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and\ncomplete disclosure of the financial activity under your CAGI grant. Your accounting records should contain\ninformation showing expenditures under the grant and must be supported by items such as payroll records,\ntime and attendance records, cancelled checks, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard grant funds and make sure that they are used for authorized\npurposes only. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must documents be kept? All financial records, including payroll, time and attendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, and\nsimilar documents associated with your CPD award should be kept for at least three years from the date\nthe COPS Office officially closes the award. Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify\nthem by grant year or by fiscal year, whichever you find more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation,\naudit or other action involving these records has been started before the end of the three-year period, the\nrecords should be kept until completion of the action. These records should be easily located and should\nbe properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to maintain adequate records to document award\nexpenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds that cannot be supported with appropriate\nrecords. Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by grant year or by fiscal year, whichever\nyou find more convenient. What if we have more than one grant?",

If your agency has more than one COPS Office grant or a grant from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization\nfrom the COPS Office, or in the case of a grant from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your\naccounting systems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the\nComptroller General of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office\nmay access these records for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 34 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual V. Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your grant may be subject to an audit by independent\nexaminers. The two primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice,\nOffice of the Inspector General (OIG) audits. Requirements and audits What are the regulations governing Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements? The Single Audit Act of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving\nfederal financial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised June 27, 2003 and again\nJune 26, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003 to reflect revised audit criteria and\nreporting requirements. The new Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 2 C.F.R. Part 200 \u2014 Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform\nGuidance) was effective on December 26, 2013, was implemented by federal agencies on the required\neffective date of December 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of\nSAA requirements. Who must have an SAA audit? A nonfederal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the nonfederal entity\u2019s fiscal year in federal\nawards must have a single audit conducted in accordance with \u00a7200.514 \u201cScope of audit,\u201d except when\nit elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. An\nauditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or a vendor. Specifically, \u201cFederal awards expended as a recipient\nor a subrecipient are subject to audit under \u00a7200.501, Subpart F.\u201d\nSAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute,\nin effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA\naudit is to express opinions on the grantee\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and non-major\ngrant programs, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address\nspecific compliance issues with respect to COPS Office grant requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part,\nfederal agencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in \u00a7200.338 \u201cRemedies\nfor noncompliance.\u201d",

If the U.S. Department of Justice is your cognizant\nfederal agency (see the Glossary of Terms on page 65), they should be sent to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse\nat:\nFederal Audit Clearinghouse\nBureau of Census\n1201 East 10th Street\nJeffersonville, IN 47132\nThe U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) serves as the liaison between grantees and\nauditors in the conduct of resolving and closing SAA audits. Questions and comments regarding SAA audits\nmay be directed to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. What is the role of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG)? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The primary objective of OIG audits is to assess compliance with grant conditions. OIG audits are designed to\npromote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of grants by evaluating compliance with\nlaws, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the operations encompassed in the scope of the audit. How are COPS Office grants selected for an OIG audit? The OIG may conduct an audit in response to a referral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The\nOIG also surveys U.S. Department of Justice agencies on an annual basis to solicit input on suggested audit\nareas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the OIG selects grants based on a number of\nfactors, including the geographical distribution of grants awarded, award amount, population served, and\ntype of grant (both active and expired). As such, the fact that your grant has been selected for an OIG audit is\nnot necessarily indicative of a suspected concern or problem area. The COPS Office\u2019s Grant Monitoring Division serves as the liaison between grantees and the OIG\u2019s Audit\nDivision, which conducts the audit.",

The COPS Office\u2019s Grant Monitoring Division serves as the liaison between grantees and the OIG\u2019s Audit\nDivision, which conducts the audit. After the OIG notifies the COPS Office of upcoming audits to be\nconducted, the COPS Office\u2019s Grant Monitoring Division will send out a notification letter to grantees\noutlining the scope of each audit and the anticipated audit timeframe. This notification letter also advises\ngrantees of the supporting documentation required and information necessary for the OIG during their\nscheduled field work, and provides a COPS Office point of contact to address questions and concerns. If you\nhave any questions regarding an OIG audit, please contact the COPS Office\u2019s Grant Monitoring Division at\n800-421-6770. Questions and comments regarding the administration of your CAGI grant, not specifically\nrelated to an audit, should be referred to your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist. Typical Audit Findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to grants as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems:\n\u2022 unallowable costs. Grantee incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget, were in excess\nof the approved budget, or were charged to the grant after the expiration date and a grant extension\nwas not obtained. \u2022 unsupported costs. Specific grant expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by\nadequate documentation. \u2022 lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Grantee failed to submit required 36 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual programmatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. \u2022 supplanting. Grantee could not document efforts to backfill vacant local sworn officer positions, or\ngrantee could not explain reductions in local law enforcement budget or in sworn officer positions\nduring the grant award period. \u2022 lack of adequate community policing. Grantee had difficulty demonstrating community policing\nactivities. \u2022 funds to better use. Funds could be used more efficiently based on management actions such as \u2022 reductions in outlays;\n\u2022 deobligation of funds;\n\u2022 withdrawal;\n\u2022 costs not incurred by implementing recommended improvements;\n\u2022 any other savings which are specifically identified. \u2022 questioned costs. Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding which resulted\nfrom a violation or possible violation of a provision of law, regulation, grant terms and conditions, or\nother document governing the use of federal funds; or because costs incurred appear unreasonable\nand do not reflect the actions a prudent person would take under the same circumstances; or because\ncosts at the time of the audit are not supported by adequate documentation. After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office\u2019s Grant Monitoring Division will continue\nworking as the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The COPS\nOffice will issue a closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must\nkeep all documentation related to the audit for a period of three years following the audit\u2019s closure. 37",

Reports As part of the CAGI, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Program Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CAGI funding\nseparately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal grants) to ensure accurate\nfinancial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial\ninternal controls in place to monitor the use of CAGI funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the\ngrant terms and conditions. Good practices in this area would include written accounting practices, an\naccounting system that tracks all drawdowns and grant expenditures, and the ability to track when each\nCAGI position is filled or vacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit\ncomplete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result in the suspension and possible termination of your\nagency\u2019s COPS Office grant funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the\nend of the grant period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the\nfunding period and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official grant end date;\nhowever, you will have a 90-day grace period after the grant award end date during which you can draw\ndown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before the grant end date. How do we file a Federal Financial Report? All COPS Office grantees are required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using the SF-425. Grantees are strongly encouraged to submit the quarterly SF-425 online. Visit the COPS Office website\nat www.cops.usdoj.gov and select the \u201cAccount Access\u201d link in the upper right corner to log in; once you\nare logged in, select \u201cApplications\u201d from the agency portal menu, click on the \u201cSF-425\u201d icon, and follow\nthe instructions to complete and submit your reports. The online SF-425 requires the same reporting\ninformation as the paper version. The use of this online application enables authorized users to view past\nSF-425s, and allows them to file or amend the SF-425 for the current quarter. When are Federal Financial Reports due? (see last paragraph)\nSF-425s for COPS Office grants must be submitted every quarter and no later than 30 days after the last day\nof each reporting quarter, as detailed below:\nTable 1.

When the Grant Period Has Ended At the end of your agency\u2019s grant period, the COPS Office is responsible for the closeout of your grant. As\npart of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation demonstrating that your agency has met all of\nthe financial and programmatic requirements of the grant. After the end of the grant period, your agency will be asked to submit a Final Federal Financial Report (SF425) and any applicable final program reports. Final Federal Financial Report\nThe Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) for your grant is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days\nafter the end of the grant period. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal\nexpenditures that were incurred during the life of the grant, as well as the amount of unobligated funds, if\nany. The federal funds expended should reflect only the actual allowable incurred salary and fringe benefit\ncosts for the 24-month grant period that each grant position was occupied. In addition, once you have\ncompleted your final drawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of federal funds drawn\ndown by your agency. When should all of the grant monies be spent? Grant funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the grant period. Obligated funds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency\nhas incurred but not yet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the grant period to request\nreimbursement for funds obligated. Please be advised that 2 C.F.R. Part 200.343(a) requires grantees to submit final SF-425s and 2 C.F.R. Part 200.343(b)\nrequires grantees to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration\nof the grant. In addition, be advised that failure to complete the drawdown of funds within the 90-day period\nfollowing award expiration will result in the forfeiture of the remaining eligible balance. It is possible that your agency may have excess grant funds remaining in your account following the grant\nperiod due to an overestimate of item costs during the grant period. Your agency should review its records\ncarefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred\nduring the grant period.",

Community Policing Defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies and supports the systematic\nuse of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the immediate conditions that\ngive rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. Problem solving\nProblem solving is the process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified\nproblems to develop effective responses that are evaluated rigorously. \u2022 Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems\n\u2022 Analysis: Analyzing\n\u2022 Response: Responding to problems\n\u2022 Assessment: Assessing problem-solving initiatives\n\u2022 Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location)\nCommunity policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop\nsolutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving\nmust be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to\nthink innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential\nresponses. A major conceptual vehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured\nand disciplined way is the SARA (Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine\nthe scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures.",

      "content": "Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine\nthe scope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders\nfor the selected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more\nincidents that are similar in one or more ways and that are of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a place, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of\nany of these. The police, with input from the community, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Analyzing the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses,\nestablish correlation, and develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is 51 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual important to find out as much as possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who? what? when? where? how? why? and why not? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Responding to problems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an\nidentified problem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response\nshould follow logically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific\nproblem. The goals of the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially\nreducing the problem or reducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of\ncommunity cohesion. Assessment: Assessing problem-solving initiatives\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by determining if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort\nbut also gathers data that builds knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for\nprocess, outcomes, or both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered\nduring analysis should be reviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be\ndeveloped and tested. The entire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim,\noffender, and location (the crime triangle) and those aspects that could have an impact on them\u2014for\nexample, capable guardians for victims, handlers for offenders, and managers for locations. Rather than\naddressing root causes of a problem, the police focus on the factors that are within their reach, such as\nlimiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating risk with\nunwanted behavior. Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between the law enforcement agency and the\nindividuals and organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police.",

The range of potential partners is large, and these\npartnerships can be used to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems\nthrough collaborative problem solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in\nprioritizing public safety problems. Other government agencies\nLaw enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify\ncommunity concerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies,\nprosecutors, probation and parole, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies,\nhealth and human services, child support, ordinance enforcement, and schools. 52 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual Community members/groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal\nand informal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource\nfor identifying community concerns. Partnerships with these factions of the community can engage\nthe community in achieving specific goals at town hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings,\ndecentralized offices or storefronts in the community, and team beat assignments. Nonprofits / service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its\nbehalf can be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share\ncertain interests and can include such entities as victims\u2019 groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups,\nadvocacy groups, and the faith community. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners\nbecause they often bring considerable resources to bear on problems of mutual concern. Businesses can\nhelp identify problems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security apparatus\nand community outreach. The local chamber of commerce can also assist in disseminating information\nabout police and business partnerships and initiatives. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. It can\nassist with publicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government\nor community agencies or new laws or codes that will be enforced.

It encourages the application of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing emphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and\ninfuse it throughout the entire department, including the way the department is managed and organized,\nits personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management needs to infuse community policing ideals\nthroughout the agency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations, decentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures,\norganizational evaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture Changing the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that\nvalues systematic problem solving and partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the\ninformal networks and communication that take place within agencies to support this orientation. Leadership Leaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to\nimplement community policing, and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and\nmission within their organization and support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the\ndominant way of doing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of\norganized labor need to be a part of the process and function as partners in the adoption of the community\npolicing philosophy. Including labor groups in agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are\nimperative to community policing implementation. Decision making Community policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision\nmaking. Decentralized decision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in\ncommunity policing. When an officer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she\nultimately feels accountable for those solutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of\nthe community. Decentralized decision making involves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing\ntolerance for risk taking in problem-solving efforts, and allowing officers discretion in handling calls. In\naddition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various resources to attack a problem and allowing\nofficers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community will help define problems and develop\npossible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide 54 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual commitment to community policing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and\nexpertise. If a strategic plan is to have value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and\nable to give examples of their efforts supporting the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission\nand value statement should be simple and communicated widely. Everything should connect back to this\nplan.",

Components such as the organization\u2019s mission\nand value statement should be simple and communicated widely. Everything should connect back to this\nplan. Policies Community policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures\nto ensure that community policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and partnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with\ncorresponding sets of procedures where appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrest, response\ntimes, tickets issued, and crime rates), community policing calls for a broadening of police outcome\nmeasures to include such things as community satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems,\nand improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to\nevaluation\u2014one that looks at how feedback information is used, not only how it measures outcomes. Transparency Community policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than\ntraditional policing. If the community is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily\nsharing relevant information on crime and social disorder problems as well as police operations with the\ncommunity. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local\npatrol officers have decision-making authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved\nthrough long-term assignments, the development of officers who are generalists, and using special units\nappropriately. Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term\nassignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or areas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance\ncustomer service and facilitate more contact between police and citizens, thus establishing a strong\nrelationship and mutual accountability. Beat boundaries should correspond to neighborhood boundaries\nand other government services should recognize these boundaries when coordinating government publicservice activities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers have to be able to handle multiple\nresponsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the\ncommunity. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just in special units, although\nthere may be a need for some specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly\ncomplex problems or managing complex partnerships. Resources and finances Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources to\nsupport community policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are 55 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual sustainable and effective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of\nan agency, including recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff\u2014\nincluding sworn officers, non-sworn officers, civilians, and volunteers, as well as personnel evaluations,\nsupervision, and training. Recruitment, hiring, and selection Agencies need a systematic means of incorporating community\npolicing elements into their recruitment, selection, and hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize\ncommunity policing and problem-solving responsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers\nwho have a spirit of service, instead of only a spirit of adventure.",

Job descriptions should recognize\ncommunity policing and problem-solving responsibilities and encourage the recruitment of officers\nwho have a spirit of service, instead of only a spirit of adventure. A community policing agency must also\nthoughtfully examine where it is looking for recruits, whom it is recruiting and hiring, and what is being\ntested. Some community policing agencies also look for involvement of the community in this process\nthrough the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations Tie performance evaluations to community policing principles\nand activities that are incorporated into job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional structures\nshould support sound problem-solving activities, proactive policing and community collaboration, and\ncitizen satisfaction with police services. Training Training at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles\nand tactics. It also needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical\nskills, and techniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order. Officers can be trained\nto identify and correct conditions that could lead to crime, to raise public awareness, and to engage the\ncommunity in finding solutions to problems. Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to\nencourage problem solving and help officers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community\npolicing is institutionalized in the organization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place\nregularly. Information systems (technology) Community policing is information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in helping to provide ready\naccess to quality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective\nand ensures that officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with improving two-way communication with citizens and\nwith developing agency accountability systems and performance outcome measures. Communication/access to data Technology provides agencies with the ability to communicate\nexternally with the public and internally with their own staff. To communicate with the public, community\npolicing encourages agencies to develop two-way communication systems through the Internet to provide\nonline reports, reverse 911 and e-mail alerts, discussion forums, and feedback on interactive applications\n(surveys, maps), thereby creating ongoing dialogs and increasing transparency. Technology also encourages effective internal communication through memos, reports, newsletters, e-mail 56 2015 COPS Anti-Gang Initiative (CAGI) Grant Owner\u2019s Manual and enhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other\nentities for more efficient operations. Community policing advocates the use of technology to develop\naccountability and performance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a\nbroad array of measures and information. Community policing also promotes the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely\ninformation on crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers\nin their patrol cars or through personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem\nanalysis functions by enabling agencies to gather information on greater aspects of events including more\ndetailed information on offenders, victims, crime locations, and quality-of-life concerns, and to further\nenhance analysis.
