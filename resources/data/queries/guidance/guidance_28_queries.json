      "content": "The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed for any\nallowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your CAMP award is two years (24 months). Your award number is in the following format: 2018-AMWX-0000 for awards funded in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. The\nCOPS Office tracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency\u2019s\naward number (or your agency\u2019s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. Your originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If you have any questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your\nagency\u2019s ORI number when you contact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency\u2019s nine- or thirteendigit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP vendor\nnumber differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for administrative\npurposes in connection with this award program, and should not be used for IRS purposes. 2 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Award terms and conditions The award terms and conditions are listed on your agency\u2019s award document.

Unless otherwise approved by the COPS Office, consultant rates will be based on the\nsalary a consultant receives from his or her primary employer, as applicable, up to $650 per day. For consultant or\ncontractor rates which exceed $650 per day, the COPS Office requires written justification if the consultants or\ncontractors are hired through a noncompetitive bidding process and recipients must receive COPS Office approval\nof those rates before drawing down award funds. Determinations of approval will be made on a case-by-case basis.

The COPS Office award funds may be used to backfill the resulting\nvacancy with newly hired personnel for an equivalent amount of time. \u2022 Any officer(s) or civilian(s) that you are hiring bring(s) your force not only to a number over and above the\nnumber of funded positions that you had on the date of your COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program\napplication (including funded but vacant positions) but also over and above the number of locally funded\npositions during the award period. \u2022 During the life of your award, you must continue to hire as many new, locally funded officers or civilians as\nyou would have if you had not received your award. You may not cancel or postpone spending money in your\nbudget that is committed to hiring other new officers or civilians. \u2022 You must take expeditious and timely steps to fill any vacancies that were created on or after the date of your\naward application by retirement, resignation, or other reasons with new officers or civilians other than your\nCAMP positions. Example: If you are redeploying a current employee who would otherwise be paid $75,000 in salary and benefits\nduring the life of the award project, your agency must continue to pay this employee with local funds. The COPS\nOffice award funds may be used to backfill the resulting vacancy with a new hire, even though the COPS Officefunded position will not be working directly on the COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program. Equipment and technology To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Equipment and technology must be purchased on or after the award start date (unless an exception is\nauthorized in writing by the COPS Office) and must be in addition to purchases that the recipient is obligated\nor funded to make in the current budget. Funds currently allocated to purchase equipment or technology\nmay not be reallocated to other purposes or reimbursed upon the award of a COPS Anti-Methamphetamine\nProgram award. For example, a recipient who has budgeted local funds to pay for a new computer system\nmay not reallocate those funds to pay for any other law enforcement cost as a result of receiving CAMP funds\nfor the same computer system. 8 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Overtime To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Sworn officer overtime exceeds expenditures that you are obligated or funded to pay in the current budget. Funds currently allocated to pay for overtime may not be reallocated to other purposes or reimbursed upon\nthe award of a COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program award.",

Additionally, by the conditions of this award,\nyou are required to track all overtime funded through the COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program. Training To meet this award condition, you must ensure the following:\n\u2022 Any training provided by the COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program is in addition to the number of hours of\ntraining already provided by your agency. Funds currently allocated for training may not be reallocated to\nother purposes. Note: This award condition applies to all state or locally funded agencies working in partnership with your agency\nunder this award. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that any state or locally funded partnership agencies use\nCOPS Office funds only to supplement, not supplant, their state or local funding as described in this condition. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement you award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Awards may be extended a maximum of 24 months\nbeyond the initial award expiration date. Any request for an extension beyond 24 months will be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable justification for delays will be granted nocost extensions. Reasonable justifications may include technology implementation delays, training delays, or other\ncircumstances that interrupt the 24 month award funding period. An extension allows your agency to compensate\nfor such delays by providing additional time to complete the full 24 months of funding. Extension requests must be\nreceived prior to the end date of the award. 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.308(d)(2). Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. However, if justified, the COPS Office seeks to accommodate\nreasonable requests for no-cost time extensions in order to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed; extensions will not be processed prior to 90 days of the award end date. Requests\nto extend the award period must be submitted online and received by the COPS Office before the official award\nend date. Extension requests received after the expiration date will only be considered when the recipient\nprovides justification of extraordinary circumstances; an example of this would be an instance where an\nunforeseen natural disaster prevented a recipient from requesting an extension. Failure to submit a request for a\nno-cost time extension by the end date may result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. 9 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual All extension requests require review and approval by the COPS Office. Individual or cumulative requests greater\nthan one-half of the award\u2019s original term (i.e., 12 months) will require additional justification and must include a\ndetailed timeline.",

Individual or cumulative requests greater\nthan one-half of the award\u2019s original term (i.e., 12 months) will require additional justification and must include a\ndetailed timeline. If your agency has excess funds remaining at the end of the award due to salary and fringe benefit costs that were\nlower than anticipated, your agency cannot extend the 24-month funding period for the purpose of expending\nthose excess funds. Recipients are entitled to a maximum of 24 months of federal funding based on the approved\nsalary and fringe benefits costs in the FCM. The COPS Office will deobligate any remaining award funds during the\ncloseout process. If you have any additional questions regarding a no-cost time extension, please contact your\nCOPS Office Grant Program Specialist. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nOccasionally, a change in an agency\u2019s fiscal or law enforcement situation necessitates a change in its COPS Office\nCAMP award. Award modifications under CAMP are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\n200.308. For federal awards in excess of $250,000, any modification request involving the reallocation of funding\nbetween budget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of the total approved budget\nrequires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award amount or budget modification\npercentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In addition, any budget\nmodification that changes the scope of the project requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. In addition,\nplease be aware that the COPS Office will not approve any modification request that results in an increase of\nfederal funds. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items, or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you are required to expend award\nfunds only as approved in the Financial Clearance Memorandum. Any requests to change or alter awards require\nwritten approval from the COPS Office prior to their implementation. Without prior written approval, you must\ncontinue to implement your award as it was originally awarded and accepted by your agency. Please be advised\nthat reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be approved (construction, indirect costs, etc.). Your agency may reprogram its budget up to an aggregate (over the course of your project) of 10 percent of the\ntotal project cost without prior written approval from the COPS Office. However, you should notify your COPS\nOffice Grant Program Specialist of any reprogramming that falls below the 10 percent threshold as well. For\nawards in excess of $250,000, any reprogramming of funds that totals an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the\napproved budget requires prior written approval from the COPS Office. What you should do: You are required to notify your COPS Office Grant Program Specialist if you determine that your agency will need\nto reprogram award funds.",

The COPS Office will then evaluate your request and notify your agency of\nour decision in writing. Implementation of the modified award budget may begin following written approval from\nthe COPS Office. Please note that modification approvals for active awards will be accompanied by a modified FCM\nreflecting the approved changes. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of its award programs. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10385(b). Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may be\ncarried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine what programs are working, how programs may be improved, and why\ncertain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which your\nagency implements its CAMP award. In some jurisdictions, COPS Office staff or evaluators may study the\neffectiveness of funded programs, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the programs\u2019\neffect on crime, victims of crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask questions about\nthe challenges encountered during project implementation, how residents feel about community policing, and\nhow police feel about their work. This information will be useful to other communities and police agencies across\nthe country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your department, observe activities, and obtain written\nreports about and from your department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and information-gathering\nactivities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information about your award activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). 2 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 200.327 \u2013\n200.328. The progress report is used to track your agency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing\nstrategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity\nthrough COPS Office funding. The Federal Financial Report is used to track the expenditures of the recipient\u2019s award\nfunds on a cumulative basis throughout the life of the award. 11 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual",

In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress of our\nprograms and recipients. What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with CAMP\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d tab of the COPS Office website at www.cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) within\n30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days after the end of the award\nperiod. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during the funding period and the\nremaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your agency is not permitted to draw\ndown federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date; however you will have a 90 day grace\nperiod after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for eligible expenditures incurred before\nthe award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic and/or financial report submission\nper fiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable expenses, and may be required\nto receive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports are discussed in greater detail\nin the section titled \u201cReports,\u201d in this manual. All reports should be submitted within the deadlines given to avoid\nsuspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions; failure to submit required reports\nmay also impact future funding opportunities. 9. Award monitoring activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that law enforcement agencies receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be\nmonitored to ensure compliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS\nOffice is also interested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both\naspects of award implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process\ncoordinated by the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include\nsite visits, office-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and\naudit resolution. As a COPS Office award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests for\ninformation pertaining to your award. This includes all financial records, such as general accounting ledgers and all\nsupporting documents. All information pertinent to the implementation of the award is subject to agency review\nthroughout the life of the award, during the close-out process and for three-years after the submission of the final\nexpenditure report. 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10385(a) and 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.333 & 200.336.",

Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain a\nmonitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are adhering to COPS Office award\nrequirements and develops the best technical assistance based on this feedback. In addition, the monitoring\ncomponent provides customer service and technical assistance to help ensure recipients understand how to\nremain in compliance while implementing their awards. 12 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and nonroutine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds, both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients\u2019 compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\n1. Site visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to\nconduct site visits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is\nthree-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to prepare\nfor the review of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period of one or\nmore days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance issues while onsite, or if necessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an opportunity to seek\ncustomer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their award. 2. Enhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an\nEOBGR conducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an\nalternative for conducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall award\nmonitoring strategy. The purpose of the EOBGR is three-fold:\ni. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\nii. To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies\niii. To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This\nreview is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Recipients will have an opportunity to\nresolve any identified noncompliance issues, or if necessary, following the EOBGR interview. In addition,\naward recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the\nimplementation of their award. 3. 4. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many\nsources.",

An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that\noriginates from an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many\nsources. Internal ANCRs generally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office\nFinance Division, or the COPS Office Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a\nnoncompliance issue to the ANCR. External noncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous\ncomplainants, media, citizens, law enforcement agencies, other federal agencies, or other outside\nsources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office ANCR staff members determine the appropriate course of\naction to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter\ncontact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the Office of the Inspector General. Each ANCR referral is\nresolved as a violation or nonviolation based upon the preponderance of the supporting documentation\nor other facts to determine if the award recipient is in compliance or noncompliance. Audit liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event\nyour agency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from\nnoncompliance and/or poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with\nyour agency to resolve and close these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may\n13 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual include repayment of award funds and/or providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance\nand/or providing proof of policies or procedures that were created or revised to directly address the\ncauses for the noncompliance as a proactive preventative measure to avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award funds,\nor a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time. Under certain conditions, additional\nactions may include referral and placement on the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s High Risk List, which will include\nmandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training and being subject to\nincreased monitoring of current and future awards while on the list. In the event of criminal misuse of award\nfunds, recipients may also be subject to fines and imprisonment. To avoid findings of noncompliance, recipients\nare strongly encouraged to become familiar with the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Grant Monitoring\nStandards and Guidelines and with the Award Owner\u2019s Manual for the year in which the award was made. Recipients should also contact the COPS Office or their Grant Program Specialist at any time during the life of a\nCOPS Office award with questions concerning award conditions, terms, or requirements to seek guidance to avoid\nnoncompliance.",

Computer Network Requirement\nCondition: The recipient understands and agrees that no award funds may be used to maintain or establish a computer\nnetwork unless such network blocks the viewing, downloading, and exchanging of pornography. Nothing in this\nrequirement limits the use of funds necessary for any federal, state, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any\nother entity carrying out criminal investigations, prosecution, or adjudication activities. Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2018, Public Law 115-141, Division B, Title II, Section 531. Why this condition:\nSection 531 of Division B, Title II, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Pub. L. 115-141) prohibits the use\nof federal funds to maintain or establish a computer network that does not block the viewing, downloading, and\nexchanging of pornography. This provision protects the public interest in the proper management and use of\nfederal funds. What you should do: The recipient must not use award funds to maintain or establish a computer network unless the network blocks\npornography. This does not limit the use of funds for criminal investigations, prosecution or adjudication activities. 27. Contracts and/or MOUs with Other Jurisdictions\nCondition:\nEquipment, technology, training, vehicles, sworn law enforcement officer positions and civilian positions, awarded\nmust only be used for law enforcement activities or services that benefit your agency/taskforce and the population\nthat it serves.

Therefore, the recipient must use the CAMP award funding to benefit its own service population. What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the CAMP award cannot provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies unless\nthey will directly benefit the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction.",

What you should do:\nOfficers funded under the CAMP award cannot provide contract law enforcement services to other agencies unless\nthey will directly benefit the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, a sheriff\u2019s department cannot use a CAMPfunded officer to provide contract law enforcement services to a neighboring county, but can use the CAMPfunded officer to provide direct law enforcement services to towns within its own county. 28. Criminal Intelligence Systems\nCondition:\nRecipients using CAMP funds to operate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system must comply with\noperating principles of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. By signing the Certification of Review and Representation of Compliance\nwith Requirements in the application, the recipient assured the COPS Office that it will comply with the\nrequirements of 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Why this condition: If your agency receives funding for equipment or technology that will be used to operate an inter-jurisdictional\ncriminal intelligence system, you must comply with the operating principles found in 28 C.F.R. Part 23. An interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system is generally defined as a system that receives, stores, analyzes, and\nexchanges or disseminates data regarding on-going pre-arrest criminal activities (examples of such activities\ninclude, but are not limited to, loan sharking, drug or stolen property trafficking, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and public corruption) and shares this data with other law enforcement jurisdictions. 28 C.F.R. Part 23\ncontains operating principles for these inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence systems which protect individual\nprivacy and constitutional rights. If your agency will use CAMP award funds simply to operate a single agency database (or other unrelated forms of\ntechnology) and will not share criminal intelligence data with other jurisdictions, 28 C.F.R. Part 23 does not apply\nto this award. What you should do:\nAll CAMP recipients were required to agree to the Certification of Review of Criminal Intelligence Systems/28 C.F.R. Part 23 as part of their application proposal so the COPS Office can track which agencies intend to use their award\nfunds to operate interjurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. If your agency intends to use award funds to\noperate an interjurisdictional criminal intelligence system, you should have indicated this in your application and\ncertified your agency\u2019s agreement to comply with the operating principles found at 28 C.F.R. Part 23. Your agency\nnow must comply with 28 C.F.R. Part 23 in operating the inter-jurisdictional criminal intelligence system funded\nthrough your CAMP award. 32 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual 29.

Law Enforcement Information Sharing\nCondition:\nRecipients agree to share relevant law enforcement information collected as a result of CAMP funding with the\nU.S. Department of Justice Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Fusion Center. Why this condition: The CAMP award is intended to assist states in tackling their methamphetamine challenges. To coordinate rapid\nand targeted responses to overdose events and to support investigative efforts, CAMP award recipients must\nshare information with federal, state, local, and tribal public safety partners. Sharing public safety data on drug\ninvestigations, diversion reports, and changing local illicit drug supply can help inform public health preparedness\nand response efforts. What you should do:\nCAMP award recipients must share all relevant law enforcement information with the OCDETF Fusion Center. 33 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What are the specific rules regarding termination of award funding? The COPS Office may suspend, in whole or in part, or terminate funding or impose other sanctions on a recipient\nfor the following reasons:\n\u2022 Failure to substantially comply with the requirements or objectives of the Public Safety Partnership and\nCommunity Policing Act of 1994, program guidelines, or other provisions of federal law\n\u2022 Failure to make satisfactory progress toward the goals or strategies set forth in this application\n\u2022 Failure to adhere to award agreement requirements or special conditions\n\u2022 Proposing substantial plan changes to the extent that, if originally submitted, would have resulted in the\napplication not being selected for funding\n\u2022 Failure to submit required or requested reports\n\u2022 Filing a false statement or certification in this application or other report or document\n\u2022 Other good cause shown\nPrior to imposing sanctions, the COPS Office will provide reasonable notice to the recipient of its intent to impose\nsanctions and will attempt to resolve the problem informally.",

For the purchase of equipment, technology, or services under a COPS Office award, the recipients must\nfollow their own policies and procedures on procurement as long as those requirements conform to the federal\nprocurement requirements set forth in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.317 \u2013 200.326. As described in the award condition titled \u201cSole Source Justification\u201d recipients are required to submit a sole\nsource justification (SSJ) request to the COPS Office for noncompetitive procurements in excess of $250,000 prior\nprior to purchasing equipment, technology, or services; obligating funding for a contract; or entering into a\ncontract with award funds. If submitting a sole source justification request to the COPS Office, please use the\nformat described in the \u201cSole Source Justification Fact Sheet\u201d in the appendices of this manual. If you have any questions regarding the federal requirements that guide procurement procedures, please contact\nyour COPS Office Grant Program Specialist.

For more information regarding GPRS, please go to https://ojp.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm to view the\nUser Guide. Setting up your account How do we set up a new GPRS account? If you are a new recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s) will be\nresponsible for requesting federal funds from your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The individual(s)\nselected must click on the following link and register with the GPRS system to become a drawdown specialist for\nyour agency: https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome. All individuals that need access to GPRS must register\nseparately and create their own unique GPRS username account, as these accounts are not meant to be shared. Once you have been approved, you will receive an email containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your law enforcement\nexecutive and/or government executive or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process. Once you receive your temporary password, you should login to the GPRS website and change your temporary\npassword to a permanent password. If you ever have an issue regarding your GPRS password, you have the option\nto utilize the \u201cForgot Password\u201d link on the webpage. It will email you a new temporary password.

Prior to accessing your award funds, your agency must mail the original form to:\nOffice of Justice Programs\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer\n810 7th Street NW\nAttn: Control Desk, Fifth Floor\nWashington, DC 20001 Your agency must complete the \u201cPayee/Company Information\u201d section following the directions on the back of the\nform and also provide the award number (printed on the award document). Next, your financial institution must\ncomplete the \u201cFinancial Institution Information\u201d section and have the appropriate financial official sign the form. If you are already a COPS Office award recipient, you should already have filled out an ACH enrollment form. Therefore, your agency will not be required to submit a new ACH enrollment form for the new award as long as\nyour OJP vendor number has not changed. If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH enrollment form\ninformation, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with your state\nassigned Financial Analyst. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? Current regulations state that once you return a signed award document, your agency is required to submit a\nFederal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) at the end of every calendar quarter regardless of\naward activity. This report should reflect actual expenditures and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency\non a cumulative basis. You will not be able to make drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 report for\nthe most recent reporting quarter is not on file with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Recipients are\nencouraged to submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov.\u201d For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425, see the section of this\nAward Owner\u2019s Manual titled \u201cReporting Requirements.\u201d Filing the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. 38 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the recipient\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4. is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\nmaintains excess cash on hand;\ndoes not adhere to the terms and conditions of the award;\nfails to submit reliable and/or timely reports.",

How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements; however, your reimbursement\nrequests should cover a specific time frame and include only costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM). As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once. Can we earn interest on our award funds? For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified at 31\nC.F.R. Part 205 \u2018\u2018Rules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers\u2019\u2019 and TFM 4A\u20132000 Overall\nDisbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies. For nonfederal entities other than states, payment methods must minimize the time between your drawdown of\nfederal funds and your payment of award costs to avoid earning excess interest on your award funds. You must\naccount for interest earned on advances of federal funds as follows:\n\u2022 The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance at 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.305(b)(9) states that\ninterest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year\nmay be retained by the nonfederal entity for administrative expenses. \u2022 Any interest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts that is in excess of\n$500 per year must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment\nManagement System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nnetwork or a Fedwire Funds Service payment. For detailed information on remittance, please see the\nappendices for a full text of the electronic medium remittance options. \u2022 If you do not have access to an electronic medium option, then please make a check payable to \u201cThe\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\u201d and mail the check to Treasury-approved lockbox: HHS Program\nSupport Center, P.O.

Financial Record Maintenance Under the COPS Office CAMP award, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems and\nfinancial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include both federal\nfunds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for\nthe funds awarded. As required by 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your\naccounting system should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the\nfollowing objectives for federal awards:\n\u2022 Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. \u2022 Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. \u2022 Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your CAMP award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, cancelled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your CAMP award (including payroll, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, and purchase orders) must be retained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.333 (Retention requirements for\nrecords). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever you\nfind more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving these records has been\nstarted before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These\nrecords should be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to\nmaintain adequate records to document award expenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds\nthat cannot be supported with appropriate records. 41 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What if we have more than one award? If your agency has more than one COPS Office award or an award from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization from the\nCOPS Office, or in the case of an award from another agency, from both awarding agencies.",

Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Comptroller\nGeneral of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may access these\nrecords for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 42 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual V. Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The\ntwo primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) Requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving federal\nfinancial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on June 26,\n2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and reporting\nrequirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 C.F.R. Part 200\u2014Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) on\nDecember 26, 2013. This new guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments awarded on or after\nDecember 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of SAA requirements. 2\nC.F.R. Part 200, Subpart F \u2013 Audit Requirements, available at www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl, establishes the requirements for organizational audits that\napply to COPS Office award recipients. Recipients must arrange for the required organization-wide (not award-byaward) audit in accordance with the requirements of Subpart F. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient\u2019s fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with \u00a7200.514 Scope of audit except when it elects to have a program-specific audit\nconducted in accordance with paragraph (c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or a vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit is\nto express opinions on the recipient\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and nonmajor award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations. Single Audits may also address specific\ncompliance issues with respect to COPS Office award requirements. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, federal\nagencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.338 (Remedies for\nnoncompliance).

See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.505. These sanctions under \u00a7200.338 could include the following:\n\u2022 Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or more\nsevere enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. \u2022 Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the\nactivity or action not in compliance. \u2022 Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the federal award. 43 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual \u2022 Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 C.F.R. part 180 and federal awarding\nagency regulations (or, in the case of a pass-through entity, recommend such a proceeding be initiated by a\nfederal awarding agency). \u2022 Withhold further federal awards for the project or program.\n\u2022 Take other remedies that may be legally available.

Questions and comments regarding SAA audits may be\ndirected to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG)? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits are\ndesigned to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believed warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on an\nannual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the\nOIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the geographical distribution of\nawards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and expired), and type of award (hiring\nand non-hiring). As such, the fact that a recipient has been selected for an OIG audit is not necessarily indicative of\na suspected concern or problem area. 44 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual What are the steps in an OIG audit?",

The COPS Office interacts with the recipient to coordinate any repayments, and/or policy or\nprocedure documents to be submitted to OIG before release of the final audit report. \u2022 Final audit report \u2013 The OIG has completed its direct interaction with the recipient. The COPS Office directs\nthe recipient to formulate a Corrective Action Plan to address recommendations (findings). As each\nrecommendation is successfully addressed by the recipient, the COPS Office requests closure on the\nrecommendation. \u2022 Closing the audit \u2013 When all recommendations have been closed, the COPS Office requests closure on the\naudit from OIG and notifies the recipient that the audit is closed.

Questions and comments regarding the\nadministration of your COPS Office CAMP award, not specifically related to an audit, should be referred to your\nCOPS Office Grant Program Specialist. Typical audit findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to awards as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems:\n\u2022 Unallowable costs. Recipient incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget or a budget\nmodification, were in excess of the approved budget, or were charged to the award after the expiration date\nand an award extension was not obtained. \u2022 Unsupported costs. Specific award expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by adequate\ndocumentation (including but not limited to receipts or purchases orders), that may have been allowable\nunder the program, but for which no prior written approval was obtained from the COPS Office , or award\nexpenditures were in excess of actual approved award costs. \u2022 Lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting. Recipient failed to submit required\nprogrammatic and financial reports in a timely manner and/or had inadequate record keeping systems. \u2022 Funds to better use. Funds could be used more efficiently based on management actions such as reductions\nin outlays; deobligation of funds; withdrawal; costs not incurred by implementing recommended\nimprovements; and any other identified savings. \u2022 Questioned costs.",

Weaknesses are identified in a recipient\u2019s accounting practices, fiscal stewardship,\naccuracy of data used in the development of the award applications, and/or inventory controls that led to the\nrecommendation cited in the audit. The recipient is required to develop or revise policies and/or procedures\nconsistent with their existing practices and submit to the COPS Office to forward to the OIG to close the\nrecommendation. \u2022 Supplanting. Recipient could not document efforts to backfill vacant local sworn officer positions, or recipient\ncould not explain reductions in local law enforcement budget or in sworn officer positions during the award\nperiod. After the final OIG audit report has been issued, the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division will continue working\nas the liaison between your agency and the OIG to obtain closure on any audit findings. The COPS Office will issue\na closure letter once all audit recommendations have been closed by the OIG. You must keep all documentation\nrelated to the audit for a period of three years following the audit\u2019s closure. 46 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual VI. Reporting Requirements As part of CAMP, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as quarterly\nProgrammatic Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CAMP program award\nfunding separately from other funding sources (including other COPS Office and federal awards) to ensure accurate\nfinancial and programmatic reporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have financial internal\ncontrols in place to monitor the use of CAMP funding and ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms\nand conditions. Good stewardship in this area would include written accounting practices, use of an accounting\nsystem that tracks all award drawdowns and expenditures, and has the ability to track when award-funded\npositions are filled or vacant (including if the position was for a new hire or a rehire). Failure to submit complete\nreports or submit them in a timely manner may result in the suspension and possible termination of your agency\u2019s\nCOPS Office award funding or other remedial actions.

When the Award Period Has Ended At the end of your agency\u2019s CAMP award period, the COPS Office is responsible for the closeout of your award. As\npart of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation demonstrating that your agency has met all of the\nfinancial and programmatic requirements of the award. After the end of the award period, your agency will be asked to submit a Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425)\nand any applicable final programmatic progress reports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) for your award is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after the\nend date of the award period. To avoid being delinquent and having your funds frozen, you must submit an SF-425\nreport within the 30 day grace period, even if your final SF-425 is not due yet. You can revise that report to reflect\nyour final actual costs and revise the status as final no later than 90 days after the end date of the award period. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal expenditures that were incurred during the\nlife of the award, as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. The federal funds expended should\nreflect only the actual allowable costs incurred relative to the specific program requirements for that award. In\naddition, once you have completed your final drawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of\nfederal funds drawn down by your agency. The final SF-425 should also include the required minimum total\namount of local (recipient) cash match contributed, if applicable. When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent and expenses for all approved items in the FCM that your agency has incurred but not\nyet paid. Your agency has up to 90 days after the end of the award period to request reimbursement for funds\nobligated. Please be advised that 2 CFR \u00a7200.343(a) requires recipients to submit final SF-425s and 2 CFR \u00a7 200.343(b)\nrequires recipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of\nthe award.",

It is possible that your agency may have excess award funds remaining in your account following the award period\ndue to an overestimate of item costs during the award period. Your agency should review its records carefully to\nensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred during the award\nperiod.

Community Policing Defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of\npartnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to\npublic safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1.\n2.\n3. Community partnerships\nOrganizational transformation\nProblem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the individuals\nand organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages interactive\npartnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these partnerships can be\nused to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through collaborative problem\nsolving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and addressing public safety\nproblems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify community\nconcerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies, prosecutors, probation\nand parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies, health and human\nservices departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific goals at\ntown hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the community,\nand team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its behalf\ncan be powerful partners.",

Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its behalf\ncan be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share common\ninterests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups, advocacy\ngroups, community development corporations, and the faith community. 60 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Institutions of higher education\nInstitutions of higher education create communities of students, professors, and personnel that are important\nstakeholders. The institutions can also provide resources to law enforcement agencies by assisting with\ncommunication strategies, facilitation of community meetings, data analysis, and research. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because they\noften bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify\nproblems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and community\noutreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating information about\npolice-business partnerships and initiatives, and crime prevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community agencies\nor new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on public\nperceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving efforts. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how the\ninfrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages the\napplication of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the entire\ndepartment, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision-making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem solving\nand partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and communication that\ntake place within agencies to support this orientation. 61 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Leadership\nLeaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing and they use their position to influence and educate others about it. Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of doing business.",

Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part of\nthe process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor groups\nin agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing implementation. Decision-making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision-making. Decentralized\ndecision-making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision-making\ninvolves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving efforts, and\nallowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various\nresources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community\nwill help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan is to\nhave value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their\nefforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and values statement should be\nsimple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures,\nwhere appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime rates)\ncommunity policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include such things as greater\ncommunity satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks not only at measured\noutcomes, but also at how feedback information is used. 62 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Transparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the\ncommunity is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant information on\ncrime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local patrol officers have decisionmaking authority and are accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through long-term assignments, the\ndevelopment of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or\nareas.",

Geographic deployment of patrol officers and specialized components can help enhance customer service\nand facilitate more contact between police and citizens, thus establishing strong relationships and mutual\naccountability. Patrol beat boundaries should be aligned to neighborhood boundaries to enhance officers\u2019\nunderstanding of communities within their patrol areas and to build trust within the community. Other community\npolicing partners should become familiar with both the patrol officers and community policing officers assigned\nwithin each patrol beat to coordinate government and nongovernment community policing activities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, the culture of policing should strive to have officers have to be able to\nhandle multiple responsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the\ncommunity. Community policing encourages its adoption agency-wide, not just by special units, although there\nmay be a need for specialist units that are tasked with identifying and solving particularly complex problems or\nmanaging complex partnerships. Resources (time, finances, and people) Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources and the investment of time to support\ncommunity policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained and\neffective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency\nincluding recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from sworn officers to\ncivilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be aligned with the agencies\u2019\ncommunity policing values. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment, selection,\nand hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving responsibilities\nand encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service, not just a spirit of adventure. A community 63 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it looks for recruits, whom it is recruiting and hiring, and\nwhat is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community involvement in this process through the\nidentification of competencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations\nSupervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are incorporated\ninto job descriptions.

Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving and help\nofficers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized within the\norganization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information technology systems\nCommunity policing is highly information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in providing ready access to\nquality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective and ensures\nthat officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their patrol beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with accessing information to provide vital resources, improving\ntwo-way communication with citizens, and developing agency accountability systems and performance outcome\nmeasures. Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the public and\ninternally within their organization. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages agencies to\ndevelop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports; reverse 911; email\nalerts; Internet social media discussion forums; and feedback on interactive applications (such as surveys and\ngeographical information), thereby creating open, ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters, email and\nenhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other entities for more\nefficient operations. Community policing also encourages the use of technology to develop accountability and\nperformance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a broad array of measures\nand information. Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely information\non crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers in their patrol cars or\nthrough personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem analysis functions by enabling\nagencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime locations, and quality-of-life\nconcerns, and to further enhance analysis. 64 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual SAFECOM guidance\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Emergency Communications, in coordination with various\nstakeholder groups, develops the annual SAFECOM Guidance on Emergency Communications Grants.

Quality and accuracy of data\nInformation is only as good as its source; therefore, it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information from various\nsources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked to one another and\nchecked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance\nmeasurement. Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions\nto the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused\ninto all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about\ntheir responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A major conceptual\nvehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way is the SARA\n(scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the\nscope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the\nselected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents similar\nin one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a\nplace, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from\nthe community, should identify and prioritize concerns. 65 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding of\nthe dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish correlation,\nand develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to find out as much\nas possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?, when?, where?, how?, why?, and why\nnot? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an identified\nproblem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response should follow\nlogically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific problem. The goals\nof the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially reducing the problem or\nreducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of community cohesion.",

Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but also\ngathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process, outcomes,\nor both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis should be\nreviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and tested. The\nentire process should be viewed as circular rather than linear, meaning that additional scanning, analysis, or\nresponses may be required. Using the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/ location) To understand a problem, many problem solvers have found it useful to visualize links among the victim, offender,\nand location (the crime triangle) and those factors that could have an impact on them, for example, capable\nguardians for victims (e.g., security guards, teachers, and neighbors), handlers for offenders (e.g., parents, friends,\nand probation), and managers for locations (e.g., business merchants, park employees, and motel clerks). Rather\nthan focusing primarily on addressing the root causes of a problem, the police focus on the factors that are within\ntheir reach, such as limiting criminal opportunities and access to victims, increasing guardianship, and associating\nrisk with unwanted behavior. 66 2018 COPS Office Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) Award Owner\u2019s Manual Appendix D.
