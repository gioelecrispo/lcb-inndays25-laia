One aspect of this growth is\nevidenced by the increase in Federal offenders housed in nonFederal facilities. In addition, innovative programs such as\ncommunity-based drug treatment and sanction centers have been\nestablished or expanded. Staff members must be skilled in a number of areas to accommodate\nthe various demands of the community corrections field. Contract\ndevelopment and administration, inmate management, public\nrelations, personnel management, financial management and project\nmanagement are all areas in which staff must be proficient. 1.2 MISSION STATEMENT The mission of community corrections is to provide programs and\nfacilities for Federal offenders serving their sentences in\nnon-Bureau facilities, and to play an instrumental role in\ndesignating Bureau and non-Bureau facilities for placement of\noffenders. Community corrections staff:\nDevelop and manage contract residential resources that\nprovide:\n! (1)\npre-release assistance for inmates who are nearing\ntheir release date,\n(2)\nan option to institutional confinement for certain\nshort-term offenders and,\n(3)\na structured environment for certain probationers,\nparolees, and supervised releasees who need more assistance\nand supervision than can be provided by community\nsupervision.",

CCMs must periodically visit these\nagencies to provide general information on Bureau programs and\nservices and keep them abreast of Bureau activities. See the\nProgram Statement on Contacts with other Agencies and\nOrganizations. 2.1.1. Federal Courts It is a major responsibility of CCMs to regularly advise Federal\ncourts of services and programs available to inmates and of\nrelevant changes in Bureau policies and procedures. There are\na variety of ways to accomplish this high-priority task. CCMs\nare expected to schedule visits with members of the judiciary.

Joint\nendeavors with probation offices include visits to, and monitoring of contract programs, joint participation in training at\ninstitutions and contractor training sessions, pre-release\nmeetings, CCC staff meetings, Bureau and probation training\nconferences, etc.\nCCMs should encourage USPOs to make use of CCC programs for\nprobationers, parolees and mandatory releasees who are having\ndifficulty functioning under supervision. Also, CCMs are to encourage USPO support in utilizing CCCs as a\nsentencing option for Federal court commitments. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 2, Page 2 Good working relationships with probation officers are also\nimportant in the areas of designations, the Transitional Services\nprogram, CCC/Comprehensive Sanction Center program improvement\nand accountability, CCC options for potential supervision cases,\nand for sharing information concerning the community adjustment\nof CCC residents. 2.1.3. Bureau Institutions Close relationships must be maintained among community\ncorrections staff, Wardens and their staff.

PURPOSE AND ORGANIZATION The organization of this Chapter corresponds to the major phases\nand progression of the community corrections contracting process. It brings into focus the separate and mutual\nresponsibilities and the relationships in the contracting process\nof the Contract Oversight Specialist (COS), Community Corrections\nManager (CCM), Community Corrections Regional Safety Specialist\n(RSS), Correctional Management Center Administrator (MCA),\nCommunity Corrections Regional Administrator (CCRA), Regional\nComptroller (RC), Contracting Officer (CO) and the Community\nCorrections Administrator (CCA) in the Central Office. This Chapter also depicts the order in which the different phases\nof the contracting process are to be accomplished and who is\nresponsible for completing each phase. These procedures apply\nto all types of agreements, including those with private sector\nfirms and governmental agencies. Community corrections is responsible for program areas in the\ncontract process. Under the CCM's supervision, the COS is\nordinarily the first staff involved in the process. The\ncontributions of the COS will directly affect the timely\naccomplishment of necessary planning, placement, and\nadministration of a contract under which Federally appropriated\nfunds are obligated and expended. The COS also has primary\nresponsibility for gathering, interpreting, and transmitting\ninformation used in technical direction, inspection, and\nevaluation contractor performance. The CO is responsible for the procurement areas of contracting as\nthe government's authorized agent in dealing with contractors. Only the CO has the authority to negotiate, award, modify,\nadminister and terminate contracts. The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR),\nordinarily the CCM, and the CO are jointly responsible for\nensuring services are performed in accordance with the terms of\nthe contract.",

The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR),\nordinarily the CCM, and the CO are jointly responsible for\nensuring services are performed in accordance with the terms of\nthe contract. The CCM's decisions are ordinarily based upon the\ninformation generated and provided by the COS in the execution of\noversight duties and responsibilities. The MCA, CCRA, and Assistant Administrator for Contracting (AAC)\nare the management staff responsible for reviewing and approving\nthe COTR's request for all proposed contract actions. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 2 In addition, the management staff are responsible for overall\npolicy and contract budget development. The CCA or designee is\nthe Source Selection Official (SSO) for all community based and\njuvenile contracts. The Community Corrections and Detention\nDivision Detention Branch will appoint an SSO for all secure\nadult and juvenile contracts. 4.1.2. TYPES OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY CONTRACT The Bureau contracts with commercial sources and enters into\nIntergovernment Agreements (IGA) with government sources for the\nfollowing correctional and community corrections services:\n4.1.2.1. Community Corrections Centers Community Corrections Centers (CCCs) provide residential\ncorrectional programs near the home communities of inmates. Generally, CCCs provide programs to:\na.\ninmates nearing release to facilitate the transition\nfrom confinement to the community;\nb.\nprobationers, parolees, mandatory releases, or\nsupervised releases (U.S. Probation Officer [USPO] referrals) who\nneed a more structured environment than can be provided under\nregular supervision;\nc.\ncommunity confinement cases as described in the\nSentencing Guidelines; and\nd. direct court commitments serving short sentences. Work release facilities are included in this category,\nwhether the inmate is housed in a CCC or a jail setting. 4.1.2.2. Short-Term Jail Facilities Occasionally, it is not in the best interest of the Bureau, the\nCourt, or the inmate, to designate a Bureau facility as the place\nof confinement. The Bureau uses jails for: confinement of\ninmates designated to serve short sentences; CCC violators; or\nintermittent confinement cases, as described in the Sentencing\nGuidelines. Normally, a local jail will not be designated for\ninmates with 45 days or more remaining to be served. The\nmajority of jails the Bureau uses are under contract with the\nU.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau is an authorized\nuser. There are some jail contracts, however, that are\nexclusively contracted for by the Bureau. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 3\n4.1.2.3. Long-Term Adult Boarding Facilities Long-term adult boarding facilities are ordinarily state or\ncounty correctional facilities that provide a wide range of\nprograms and security. These facilities are primarily for\ninmates serving longer sentences than are served in a jail\nsetting. 4.1.2.4. Juvenile Facilities The term \u201cjuvenile\" is defined in Bureau policy and includes those\nunder age 18 and those between the ages of 18 and 21 who\nare sentenced under the Federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention Act. Juveniles are ordinarily boarded in non-Federal\nfacilities, both governmental and private. Specific\ncircumstances, such as a Court Order requiring CCC placement in\nan adult facility, must exist before a juvenile can be authorized\nfor placement in a Bureau CCC. The most common categories of juvenile facilities are:\na. Juvenile Boarding Institution This is a secure, institution-based facility for more serious\njuvenile inmates serving intermediate or long-term sentences, and\nmay include training schools, reformatories, youth centers, etc.\nb. Juvenile Community-Based Facility",

Juvenile Boarding Institution This is a secure, institution-based facility for more serious\njuvenile inmates serving intermediate or long-term sentences, and\nmay include training schools, reformatories, youth centers, etc.\nb. Juvenile Community-Based Facility This is a minimum security community-based facility\ngenerally with full services, and regular access to the\ncommunity. Programs such as education may be conducted solely in\nthe community. 4.1.2.5. Special Programs The Bureau can contract or enter into agreements for other\nspecialized facilities and services, such as Comprehensive\nSanction Centers (CSCs), Drug Transitional Services, and Home\nConfinement. Other examples are contracts or agreements designed\nto meet specific mental or physical health concerns for inmates\nsuch as pregnancy, mental illness, or a proclivity to commit sex\noffenses. Additionally, contracts for programs concerned with\nstudy and observation cases and drug treatment programs can be\nestablished. Provisions to meet special programming requirements\nmust be contained in the Bureau's solicitation for\nservices/Statement of Work (SOW). PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 4\n4.1.3. NEGOTIATION/CONTRACTING AUTHORITY The Bureau has authority to award option-year contracts for CCC\nservices. The most common award is for five years (two-year base\nwith three one-year option periods), for confinement of prisoners\n(18 U.S.C. 4002). The CO must adhere to the Federal Acquisition\nRegulations (FAR), the Justice Acquisition Regulations (JAR), the\nBOP Acquisition Policy (BPAP), and the Competition in Contracting\nAct (CICA). 4.1.4. TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL BINDING ARRANGEMENTS The CO shall determine the type of arrangement instrument based\nupon the requirements identified in the Request for Contract\nAction (RCA). Each contract file shall be fully documented to\nexplain why the chosen arrangement was selected. There are\nbasically four types of arrangements the Bureau uses:\n4.1.4.1.\nContract (Firm-Fixed Unit Price Requirements,\nIndefinite Quantity) The word \u201ccontract,\u201d in a broad sense, means a mutually binding\nlegal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the services\nor the supplies and the buyer to pay for them. Therefore, the word contract can mean a purchase order (PO), or a\ncontract. This provides for a fixed-price per inmate, per day, during the\nlife of the contract. This contract type places a reasonable\nmajority of risk and\nresponsibility for all costs and resulting\nprofit and loss on the contractor. It provides maximum incentive\nfor the contractor to control costs, to perform effectively, and\nto impose minimum administrative burden upon the contract\nparties. Ordinarily, the Bureau contracts for a two-year base\nperiod, to include three additional one-year options. The\ndecision to exercise an option is the Bureau's unilateral right. 4.1.4.2. Purchase Order A PO is a simplified small purchase procedure which may be\nappropriate in a variety of situations. POs cannot exceed one\nyear, nor may they extend beyond one fiscal year into the next. The two most common uses of a PO for Community corrections\ncontracts are: PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 5\na. Procuring services upon specified definitive terms and\nconditions, under which the aggregated amount does not exceed\n$100,000. This is to be used in a one-time situation where one\nor more inmates are placed in a facility, but the Bureau does not\nanticipate using the facility again (single use). b.\nPurchase of recurring requirements, when requirements\nare not known in advance. The amount shall not exceed $100,000.",

The amount shall not exceed $100,000. The FAR prohibits the use of small purchase procedures in the\nacquisition of supplies and services initially estimated to\nexceed the small purchase limitation ($100,000). Part 13.103 of\nthe FAR indicates, \"Requirements aggregating more than the small\npurchase limitation shall not be broken down into several\npurchases that are less than the limit merely to permit the use\nof small purchase procedures.\" 4.1.4.3. Intergovernmental Agreement An IGA is a bilateral agreement for services to be provided by a\nstate or local government, at a reasonable price. Ordinarily, it\nhas an indefinite expiration date. It does not\nrequire all the steps necessary in contracting with nongovernmental entities. The Bureau may be an authorized user of IGAs established by other\nFederal agencies, such as the USMS, U.S. Probation Service\n(USPS), and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS),\nwhen authorized by the agency contracting for the service. This\nis commonly known as \"piggybacking.\"\n4.1.4.4. Indefinite Quantity (Guaranteed Beds) This provides a guaranteed minimum number of inmate-days within\nthe contract period. The Bureau contracts for a one-year\nbase period to include four additional one-year options. The\ndecision to exercise an option year is the Bureau's unilateral\nright. 4.1.5.\nINTEGRITY PUBLIC INFORMATION, ETHICAL STANDARDS, AND PROCUREMENT The amount of information that may be disclosed about a\ncontract depends on whether the information pertains to a\ncontract which has been awarded or is in the pre-award stage. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 6\n4.1.5.1. Information Concerning Proposed Contracts Bureau personnel shall handle information concerning the Bureau's\nneed for services to be performed under contract as sensitive\ninformation. Extreme care shall be exercised to ensure\nno one receives information that could give any prospective\nofferor an advantage over another. Bureau personnel shall avoid\nsituations that give even the appearance someone may be receiving\nfavorable treatment or obtaining special information concerning\ncontract actions. Sensitivity to these issues shall be emphasized in all stages of\nthe contracting process. Community corrections staff\nshall constantly safeguard against activities, social or\notherwise, that might jeopardize their ability to perform their\nfunctions objectively, or which could be perceived as impairing\ntheir objectivity. For example, no employee shall accept any\ngift, benefit or service, tangible or intangible, from any\ncontractor, offeror, or related party (see 28 CFR 45 et Seq.). Section 27 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act\n(41 U.S.C. 423) provides, in part:\n\u201cDuring the conduct of any Federal agency procurement of property\nor services, no procurement official of such agency shall\nknowingly ... disclose any proprietary or source selection\ninformation regarding such procurement directly or indirectly to\nany person other than a person authorized by the head of such\nagency or the Contracting Officer to\nreceive such information.\u201d The CO must be informed promptly of all communications\nconcerning solicitations Request for Proposals (RFPs) from\nprospective offerors or any other unauthorized individuals. Community corrections staff shall refer all inquiries to the CO\nwho will determine, with the assistance of Legal Counsel, the\nappropriate response.",

Community corrections staff shall refer all inquiries to the CO\nwho will determine, with the assistance of Legal Counsel, the\nappropriate response. The primary concern in releasing information is to protect the\ncompetitive environment, the offerors confidential business\ninformation, and ultimately, the contract award itself. 4.1.5.2. Information Concerning Current Contracts Once a contract has been awarded, a large portion of the file\nbecomes releasable information (except for the items exempted\nby the Freedom of Information Act [FOIA] and Trade Secrets\nAct) through established FOIA request procedures. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 7 Generally, trade secrets and financial information are exempt\nfrom release. Individuals who request information about existing\ncontracts shall be advised to submit their request in writing to:\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\nFOI/PA Office\n320 First Street NW\nHOLC Building, Room 738\nWashington DC 20534\n4.2: PRE-SOLICITATION PHASE\n4.2.1. DETERMINATION OF NEED FOR CONTRACT SERVICES Community corrections staff must be alert to the ongoing need for\ncontract correctional services. An important responsibility\nof the CCM and COS is to identify potential contract resources. The COS determines the need for new services not available\nthrough existing contracts; contracts for services in new\ngeographical areas; and replaces, diminishes or modifies services\nfor existing contracts. Expiration of contracts, information received from Federal\ninstitution staff and USPOs, studies of population trends, and\nother data may dictate the need for additional contract resources\nwithin a given geographical area. These resources may be needed\nfor pre-release corrections, special services, or provide the\ncourt with a sentencing option. Initial sources to consult are the national professional\nassociation directories, Division of Human Services Directory,\nUSPOs, state and county correctional agencies, existing contract\nfacilities and other interested offerors. 4.2.2. REQUEST FOR CONTRACT ACTION (RCA) An RCA is a document that officially initiates a particular\nprocurement action; it is sometimes called a Requisition or\nPurchase Request. RCAs provide the basis for determining how\nprocurements will be conducted and how contracts will be awarded. They contain descriptions of the requirements, required\nauthorizations, and necessary administrative details that enable\nthe CO to prepare and issue solicitations and develop contract\ndocuments. The SOW, an essential element of the procurement\nrequest, contains information which describes tasks to be\naccomplished or delivered. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 8 The COS is responsible for identifying contract needs and\nsubmitting requests to the CCM for review and approval. The CCM\nwill ensure all RCAs exceeding $100,000 for competitively-let\nprocurements have the required Advance Procurement Plan (APP)\nform(s) completed and attached in accordance with BOP/DOJ policy\nand procedures. All RCAs are reviewed and approved by the MCA,\nCCRA, and CCA staff prior to being forwarded to the CO. The\nRequest for Contract Action (Attachment 4-1) form shall be\ncompleted for:\nall new and replacement Bureau contracts;\nIGAs the Bureau negotiated; and\nany modifications to Bureau contracts, excluding for\nexercising option years. #\n#\n# Joint use agreements. The Bureau often uses arrangements\nestablished by other Federal agencies, such as the USMS, INS,\nUSPS, etc. These arrangements will ordinarily be IGAs. The USMS\nheadquarters office will send the appropriate CCM office a copy\nof each available USMS jail contract in which Bureau use is\nincluded.",

If multiple awards are desired, they should be\noutlined in this section. Multiple awards are desired when there\nexists geographical restrictions and different types of services\nare required using the same solicitation.

When there are two types of services within a facility or\ncontract (e.g., a jail with a work release unit and a detention\nunit), determine the predominant use and use one accounting code. b. Estimated Inmate-Days and Expenditures Inmate-days and estimated costs are essential factors in the\ndevelopment of a contract. Estimates must be based upon an analysis of information which\nincludes:\nSENTRY release data; input from the U.S. Probation\nand U.S. Attorney's office; past history; population trends over\nthe last two to three years; and budgetary allowances. Central\nOffice research staff provide the Community Corrections Branch\nwith data to assist in the analysis of estimating inmate-days. Other issues that may affect inmate-days estimates and over- all\nexpenditures are:\npolicy changes affecting placements; over\ncrowding; a considerable drop in population in Bureau or state\nfacilities; the need for two or more contracts in the same\nservice area, operating under the same SOW; and new laws. The\nsources of information and the analysis of the data shall be\ndocumented and a copy attached to the RCA. At a minimum, this\nshall consist of written or telephonic documentation of\nProbation's needs and inmate-day use figures for the previous 24\nmonths, if replacing an existing contract. Yearly cost estimates should be based upon operating costs for the\nlast year, plus anticipated cost increases, multiplied by the\nestimated number of inmate-days. Additional requirements\nimposed upon a contractor by a modified or new SOW must also be\nconsidered when estimating the inmate-day rate. The estimated\nper capita or inmate-day rate is the government's initial\nestimate in determining the fair and reasonable cost for the\nservices being requested. Accurate cost estimates are also necessary to assist the CO in\ndetermining the appropriate contracting procedures to be followed\nand can result in significant time savings. When\npossible, attach the inmate-day rate of other contractors in the\nsame geographic area and the number of beds these contractors\nprovide to the RCA. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 13 For the option-year requirements contracts, the base period is\nordinarily for a 24-month period with three one-year option\nperiods. For Indefinite Quantity Contracts, the inmate-day and\nper capita costs for males and females must be separately\nidentified when the requirement is for both sexes. For POs, the aggregate cost estimate shall not exceed\n$100,000. For IGAs, inmate-day and cost figures should reflect\nestimates for a 12-month period, rather than 24 months.",

The wage\ndetermination issued by DOL shall then become part of the\nsolicitation package or resulting contract. Per the\nDOL:\nservice contract personnel for CCCs are not ordinarily key\nor professional staff; maintenance, food service, clerical, shift\nor charge-of-quarters, and correctional staff are ordinarily\nservice employees. Since the DOL has sole enforcement authority\nand responsibility to ensure these standards are met by the\ncontractor, all inquiries Bureau staff receive should be referred\nto the local DOL office. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 16\n4.3.2. COMMERCE BUSINESS DAILY The CO must forward a synopsis of the requirement to the\nCommerce Business Daily (CBD) when the estimated amount exceeds\n$25,000. This notice must be published at least 15 working days\nprior to issuing a solicitation after allowing 10 days for\nreceipt by mail. For purchases over $2,500 but less than\n$25,000, a synopsis of the requirements issued under a Request\nFor Quotes (RFQs) may be published in the CBD to satisfy\ncompetition requirements, if sufficient sources of competition\nhave not been identified. 4.3.4. STANDARD SCHEDULE OF EVENTS The CO shall establish an estimated time schedule of events for\nthe rest of the contracting cycle within 10 working days after\nforwarding the synopsis to the CBD (Attachment 4-2). Although\ncopies of this schedule are not ordinarily distributed, the CCM\nor COS may telephonically or using BOPNet GroupWise E-mail,\ncontact the CO to inquire about the status of a particular\nsolicitation. 4.3.4.

Each proposal must be\njudged by the same standards, factors, and subfactors specified\nin the solicitation. 4.4.3.4. Determining the Competitive Range To be acceptable, each proposal must describe a level of service\nthat meets the minimum technical requirements of RFP and\nstandards of the SOW. If it appears that the proposals are\nunacceptable the evaluations should identify any areas that need\nclarification, areas that are deficient, and any requirement\nexcesses. The notes regarding these issues will be used during\nnegotiations with the offerors. If the proposed program does not meet minimum standards without\nextensive revision, this fact must be noted in the evaluation\nnarrative. The written notes will support a\nrecommendation to exclude the proposal from any further\nconsideration for specific reasons, such as severe technical\ndeficiencies, failure to address the SOW, parroting the SOW, or\nthe need for a major rewrite. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 20 After the panel has evaluated and scored the proposals, the panel\nmay recommend a competitive range. That is, the panel may\ndetermine a break exists between the high and low range of\nscores, and recommends the low group be removed from the\ncompetitive range. For example, there are five offerors and the\nscores are 525, 625, 310, 570 and 385. A natural break occurs at\n525 and the panel could recommend the two lowest scoring offerors\nnot be considered in the competitive range. Reasons include: a\n(complete) lack of understanding of the requirements of the RFP\nis indicated in a company's proposal or the proposed program\ncould not be accepted without a substantial rewrite of the\nproposal. In such situations, however, the panel still addresses\nthe weaknesses and strengths of the proposals recommended for\nexclusion from the competitive range. Although a deficient proposal usually may not be included in\nfurther discussions, it is the CO who must make the determination\nand establish the competitive range. FAR 15.609 states, \"The\ncompetitive range shall be determined on the basis of cost or\nprice and other factors stated in the solicitation and shall\ninclude all proposals that have a reasonable chance of being\nselected for award.\" This provides a broad area of consideration\nby the CO who ordinarily welcomes evaluators providing narrative\ninformation in this area. If there is a close grouping of scores, it is best to recommend\nall offerors be kept in the competitive range. For\nexample, if the scoring was 515, 485, 390, 545, 410, it may be\ndetermined the scores are so close together they should all\ncontinue to be considered. Panel members should avoid the words \"responsive,\" \"responsible,\"\nor \"responsibility,\" when discussing an offeror's proposal. These\nwords have a special technical meaning in procurement and usually\nare not relevant to negotiated contracts. Rather than convey an\nofferor is \"non-responsive,\" indicate the proposal has severe\ntechnical deficiencies and/or is unacceptable as submitted by\nfailing to meet minimum requirements and no reasonable chance for\naward. 4.4.4.

NEGOTIATION WITH OFFERORS IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE The CO should either make an award without discussion based on the\ninitial proposals or conduct written or oral discussions with all\nacceptable offerors. The latter can be accomplished when the\nrequirements of FAR 15.610 are met and recommended by the SSO. If negotiations are to be conducted, the CO should advise the\nofferors of any areas that need clarification, or any\ndeficiencies in the proposals.

GENERAL Once a contract has been awarded, the contract administration\nphase begins. Contract administration is any administrative\nactivity undertaken by either the government or the contractor\nduring the time from contract award to contract close out. More\nspecifically, the term refers to steps taken by the government\nrepresentative(s) responsible for ensuring government and\ncontractor compliance with the terms and conditions of the\ncontract. Such steps include:\n#\n#\n#\n#\n# all performance (inspection) monitoring activities,\nmodifications,\nactions pertaining to disputes,\nunsatisfactory contractor performance, and\nprice redetermination.",

Such steps include:\n#\n#\n#\n#\n# all performance (inspection) monitoring activities,\nmodifications,\nactions pertaining to disputes,\nunsatisfactory contractor performance, and\nprice redetermination. Contract administration also includes problem solving\nactivities necessitated by unforeseeable circumstances - changes,\nproblems, and disagreements that arise following contract award. 4.5.2. MONITORING REQUESTS FOR CONTRACT ACTION The CCM is responsible for ensuring RCAs are submitted in a timely\nand appropriate manner. The CCM and MCA shall develop a\nrecord system to monitor the timely submission of RCAs for all\nCommunity corrections contracts. Lists can be generated from the\nContract Location Profile System (CLPS). The CCRA shall ensure\nthe MCA and the COTR have a system to alert them when requests\nare due. The MCA and CCRA shall review all RCAs and attachments,\nexcept those to exercise option years, for accuracy and\ncompleteness. 4.5.3. MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT The COS shall provide the CCM with an annual schedule of full\nand interim monitorings of contract programs. The MCA shall\nmonitor full and interim reviews conducted by CCM offices for\ntimeliness, professionalism, content, and procedural propriety. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 26 PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 27 The CCRA shall develop appropriate mechanisms to oversee the\nauditing functions of the MCA. The COS annual schedule should also include the projected month(s)\nin which preliminary site and preoccupancy visits are anticipated\nfor new or replacement contracts. Since the RSS will\nordinarily be involved in these site visits, providing him or her\nwith a copy of this schedule can be beneficial for planning\ntravel and meeting the milestones the CO established for contract\naward. The CCRA may waive a full monitoring with justifiable cause;\nhowever, this waiver should not be more than 30 days. Additionally, the CCM may make a request in writing through the\nMCA to the CCRA to waive an interim monitoring. This waiver\nrequest will be based on a determination that it is in the best\ninterest of the Bureau, and the contractor has demonstrated that\nthey are fulfilling the conditions of the SOW with few\ndeviations. The monitoring of contract programs should be scheduled to\nmaximize the time oversight staff are away from their office and\nthereby minimize the total cost of their travel. The contract\nmonitoring schedule provides oversight specialists with a\nsignificant amount of flexibility to accomplish these two\ncritical goals. 4.5.4.\n4.5.4.1. CONTRACT FILES\nOfficial Contract File The official contract file is maintained by the CO in the Central\nOffice in accordance with the requirements of procurement\nstatutes, policy, and procedure. This file documents the basis\nfor the acquisition and award, the assignment(s) of contract\nadministration tasks, and any subsequent actions taken by the\ncontracting office. 4.5.4.2. CCM Office Contract File The COS shall maintain working files, commonly referred to\nas the \"CCM Contract File\" for each contract. Occasionally, some\ncontracts may have multiple locations. Then, supplemental\ncontract files shall be prepared for each location. Each\nsupplemental file need not contain the same basic contract\ninformation (proposals, SF-26, etc.), but should contain all\nrelevant information pertaining to that particular location.

CONTRACT CLOSURE). 4.5.5. CONTRACT PROGRAM MONITORING Ordinarily, the CCM is the COTR (certified in accordance with DOJ\nand Bureau policy) and the COS acts as contract monitor. On\noccasion, the Bureau may place a COS on-site to monitor contract\ncompliance. Then, the COS will typically be the COTR. COS staff\nare responsible for monitoring contractor compliance with the\nrequirements contained in the SOW. COS staff must provide their\nsupervisors and the CO with comprehensive and accurate\ninformation concerning a contractor's performance. Bureau staff\nin the CCM office perform \"technical direction\" responsibilities\nfor work performed under contracts. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 29\n4.5.5.1. The term \"technical direction\" is defined to\ninclude, without limitation, the following:\na. Government guidance of a contractor's efforts toward\nfull compliance with the contract SOW;\nb. Redirecting the contract performance effort; c. Shifting work emphasis between areas or tasks; d. Filling in details; e. Otherwise accomplishing the actual scope of work; f.\nSupplying information to the contractor which assists in\nthe interpretation of technical portions of the SOW;\ng.\nReceiving, reviewing, and inspecting reports and\ninformation provided by the contractor to the government under\nthe contract; and\nh. Evaluating the performance and certifying all invoices\nfor payment. 4.5.5.2.\nTechnical direction must be within the general\nscope of work stated in the contract. The contract monitor does\nnot have authority to issue any direction which:\na. Constitutes an assignment of additional work outside the\ngeneral scope of the contract. b.\nConstitutes a change as defined in the contract clause\nentitled \"Changes.\"\nc.\nChanges any of the expressed terms, conditions, fixed\nprice, or time for contract performance. Only the CO shall, by\nwritten modification, authorize any such revisions. 4.5.6. MONITORING INSTRUMENTS AND SCHEDULES There are monitoring instruments and schedules for different types\nof contract services. These instruments are designed to\nassist Bureau staff in making thorough program evaluations based\non contract requirements as detailed in the SOWs. The Bureau can\nonly require compliance with items that are provided for in the\ncontract, and may only make suggestions in other areas.",

Ordinarily, the inspection team shall consist of the CCM/COTR\n(Auditor-In-Charge), the COS, and any additional staff identified\nby the CCM, MCA, or CCRA. U.S. Probation staff should\nbe invited to attend CCC full monitorings. \"Working papers\" are\nthe handwritten notes, etc., and duplicated documents which shall\nform the basis of the Contract CCC Full Monitoring Instrument\n(Attachment 4-7).

Ordinarily all jail and long-term adult confinement\nfacilities will be inspected prior to the contract being\ninitiated and/or activated. The contract \"status\" assignment code for these contracts will be\nactive (A) unless the contract has expired or it has been\nterminated.

When a contract confinement facility also has a work\nrelease program which is the predominant use, the frequency of\nmonitorings shall follow those outlined for CCCs. The monitoring\ninstrument however, should continue to be the appropriate\nconfinement checklist. During the monitorings of this type of\nprogram, the contractor's procedures to verify inmate employment\nand the system for general accountability of inmates while in the\ncommunity shall be closely examined and addressed in the report. g.\nContract confinement facility full monitorings shall be\nrecorded on the appropriate standard monitoring checklist (see\nAttachment 4-9 and 4-10).",

MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF CCC CONTRACT PERFORMANCE Monitoring a contractor's performance should be viewed as a daily,\ncontinuous, on-going, routine process and not limited to formal\nmonitoring trips to the facility. The COTR is responsible\nfor completing the Contractor Evaluation Form (CEF) \u201cReport\nCards\u201d (see Attachment 4-13). The contractor\u2019s performance will be\nevaluated at least two times during the life of the contract. The\nfirst report card is required at the end of the two year base\nperiod with a follow-up to be completed at the beginning of the\nlast option year when an RCA is submitted to the Central Office\nfor a replacement contract. Once each report card is completed,\nit is sent to the contractor for comment. The contractor has 30\ndays to comment, rebut, and/or provide additional information to\nthe COTR. If the contractor disagrees with the rating, the\ninformation will be reviewed by the MCA, who will consider the\ncomments made by the contractor and decide the final rating. The\nMCAs decision must be in writing and completed within 15 days\nfrom receipt of the rebuttal statement. The MCA is the final\nauthority. This contractor information will be used during the\nevaluation panel process.",

Programs a.\nExamination of program components should be completed to\nensure appropriate privilege and supervision requirements are\nfollowed. b.\nContractors must develop a network of community\nresources to meet the needs of Federal offenders assigned to\ntheir care. These resources must include a minimum of those\nlisted in the SOW for the contract facility. CCMs should\nencourage the contractor to use volunteer groups and programs. It is the CCMs' responsibility to ensure procedures used to\nselect and train volunteers follow the same standards of conduct\nand screening procedures that apply to paid employees. c.\nResident files maintained at the CCC should be closely\nreviewed to ensure each resident has a descriptive, written\nprogram plan. Case notes should clearly address a resident's progress in:\n!\n!\n!\n! employment,\nhousing,\nsubstance abuse counseling, and\nother transitional or treatment needs. d.\nProgram subsistence collection procedures should be\nreviewed. Special emphasis should be on:\n!\n!\n!\n! collecting appropriate amounts,\nfollowing procedures to modify or waive the amount,\ninternal control measures, and\nreceipt and disposition of collected monies. e.\nDuring all reviews, employment records of all Federal\nresidents should be closely reviewed. f. Substance Abuse (1)\nOffenders with a condition of drug aftercare or\nhistory of substance abuse are required to be in drug counseling\nwhile at the center, rather than waiting until they are released\nfrom the CCC. Whenever possible, the resident should receive\ncounseling from the same person and/or agency the USPO requires\nwhen released to supervision. The primary exception to this is\nwhen the CCC has a specialized drug counseling program or\ncounselor that is an integral part of the contractor's program. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 40\n(2)\nContractors must meet with the USPO to develop a\ncounseling program for the resident with drug aftercare as a\ncondition of release. If the contractor sets up a conference and the USPO\ndoes not attend, then the contractor's responsibility is met. The CCM, however, should contact the USPO to discuss this issue\nsince the USPS has agreed to assist our contractors in setting up\ncounseling sessions. (3)\nRandom urinalysis specimens should be taken at the\nrate of one for every 10 residents or less per month; between 11\nand 20 residents, two tests are required per month; between 21\nand 30 residents, three tests are required per month, and so on. The total number of residents upon which the rate should be based\nshould not include USPS cases. Residents with a drug aftercare\ncondition or a history of drug abuse should provide four\nurinalysis specimens every month. Residents who are members of disruptive groups shall be\nadministered a random urinalysis at least once per month. All urinalysis specimens shall be taken on an unannounced,\nsurprise basis and tested for all drugs/substances noted in the\nPRIMARY TEST PANEL included in the SOW. (4)\nThe COS is responsible for maintaining a file\ncontaining the monthly urinalysis specimen report contractors\nsubmit. A tracking system should be developed to ensure the\nrequired number of urinalysis specimens are collected.

The COS must check this procedure to ensure\nspecimens are kept secure from all residents and other\nunauthorized persons. (6)\nThe USPS is responsible for drug aftercare\nservices (urinalysis, alcohol testing, and counseling) for\nsupervision cases (those persons under supervision of the USPO). g.\nStaff must review the contractor's method and plan of\nissuing passes to determine:\n!\n!\n! how soon after admission the first pass is issued;\nthe length of time for a pass;\nif there is a graduated policy; PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 41\n!\n! who signs the passes; and\naccountability during the pass period, etc. h.\nThe contractor is required to contact the USPO for\ncomments on passes and furloughs that have been recommended for a\nresident. If the USPO does not respond after reasonable attempts\nat communication, the contractor has met the requirement and\nshould proceed with the next step. These attempts to contact the USPO should be documented. The\nCCM should be alert to requests for furlough on Central Inmate\nMonitoring (CIM) cases, checking on separatees, and\nrequesting clearance for any furlough outside the immediate area. The inmate-day rate for residents in this status is\nordinarily 50% of the regular inmate-day rate. i. The contractor should not reserve a bed for Home\nConfinement residents. The CCM should ensure the USPO is involved in the decision to\nplace an inmate on Home Confinement. The rate for residents\nin this status is ordinarily 50% of the regular inmate-day rate. j. The COS is responsible for providing necessary Bureau\nforms to the contractor. These forms can be obtained through\nnormal ordering procedures. In emergencies, forms can be\nobtained from a nearby Federal institution. 4.5.7.7.

CONTRACTOR TRAINING AND MANAGEMENT/TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE One of the Bureau's goals is to increase the quality of contract\ncorrections provided to Federal inmates. CCM office\nstaff are responsible for providing on-going assistance in the\ntraining of contractor staff. Assistance, however, in the form PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 43\nof Bureau training never relieves the contractor from its legal\nobligation of providing fully compliant contract performance\nduring the entire performance period. 4.5.8.1. Training a.\nOn-Site CCM Training. At least annually, CCM office\nstaff shall hold either individual or group training sessions\nwith contract staff and provide an orientation to all newly\nemployed CCC staff at the contractor's facility, using Bureau or\noutside resources. Staff must be aware of any self-contained\ntraining packages the Bureau produced. Annual training shall\ninclude:\n!\n!\n!\n!\n! discipline,\nintegrity,\naccountability,\nlife/safety, and\nother relevant issues. b.\nEach region shall hold a contractor training conference\nor forum, on a Region-wide or Management Center level, every 18\nmonths. This conference should focus on Management Center,\nRegional and National Community corrections and other relevant\nissues. Resource staff and guest speakers might include Federal\nJudges and Probation Officers, the Director, Assistant Director,\nand Regional Director, the CCA, and representatives from the\nBureau Procurement and Property Branch. c. If key contractor personnel leave their positions, their\nreplacements must receive training within 90 days at the\ncontractor\u2019s expense. Key personnel are the foundation of a\nmodel CCC operation. Training programs help contract staff\nbetter understand the Bureau's requirements and operations. d. The CCM should document training given and to whom,\neither by individual certificate or letter. This documentation\nlends credence to the contractor's knowledge of Bureau\nrequirements and may be useful if inmates initiate litigation. A\ncopy of this training document shall be maintained in the CCM\nContract File. If the training program used an agenda it should be\nattached. Be sure to document the use of any training resources in\nthe memo. e.\nUSPO Contacts. One of the most important aspects of a\ncontract CCC is its relationship with the USPS. It is the CCM's\nresponsibility to serve as a liaison between the CCC and the\nlocal USPO. The CCM will help in solving problems that occur\nbetween the USPO and the CCC and in some situations will work out PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 44\na direct conflict between them.

Staffing (1)\nIdentify available training opportunities. (2)\nArrange visits to Federal institutions for\ncontract staff. (3)\nEncourage contract staff participation in\nprofessional organizations. (4)\nEmphasize the importance of CCC staff training and\nretention programs. b. Facility Ensure the contractor meets Bureau requirements regarding\nsafety, sanitation, permits, etc., in connection with the\nfacility and services. c. Program (1)\nMake sure contract staff are aware of available\nstate and local programs, such as mental health programs and\nemployment training and assistance.",

(2)\nAssist contractors to develop student intern\nprograms that can aid in providing counseling services. d. Reporting of Management/Technical Assistance CCM office staff shall report, in writing, to the MCA and CCRA,\nany management assistance they provide to any agency of the\ncriminal justice system. 4.5.9. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS The CLPS is an automated contract information system\nmaintained in the SENTRY database. This system provides\ntechnical and descriptive information about contracts and is used\nby all Bureau staff to locate facilities. In addition, it\nprovides community corrections staff with information on\nmonitorings, contract expiration dates, quotas, etc. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 46\nInstructions for data submission and general use of the system\nare contained in the Technical Reference Manual on SENTRY General\nUse. It is essential that CCM office staff update the\ninformation whenever contract resources are added, deleted,\ninspected, or whenever the descriptive information is changed. When USMS inspections of contract jails are made between Bureau\ninspections, staff shall update the system to reflect the audit. 4.5.10. MODIFICATION OF SOW/CONTRACT Modifications may be made to the SOW when certain additions or\ndeletions (within the scope of work of the existing contract) are\nnecessary and adjustments in the price or services are not\nrequired. Modifications which are determined to be significant\nchanges to the SOW or requirements of the original contract can\njeopardize the remaining unexercised periods of performance\ncontained in the originally awarded contract. If the COS believes it is advantageous to the government to modify\nthe contract, he or she must submit a RCA through the CCM, MCA,\nand to the CCRA, who forwards it to the CO through the CCA. 4.5.11. OPTION YEAR CONTRACTS Once the COS determines the need for continued CCC services with\nan existing contract, the COTR shall submit an electronic request\nto the Community Corrections Branch, the CCRA, and the MCA, to\nexercise the next option year. The submission must be\ncompleted four months in advance of the end of the performance\nperiod. For contracts in excess of $25,000 but less than $500,000, the\nCOS shall submit an Individual Acquisition Plan (IAP)along with\ntheir request to exercise an option year. For contracts over $500,000 CCB will complete and submit an\nAPP directly to the CO. 4.5.12. PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS Any problems regarding contractor performance must be\nthoroughly documented. Ordinarily, the contractor must be\nnotified of the problem(s) and given an opportunity to take\ncorrective action. This is characterized by the monitoring\nprocess, but may occur anytime circumstances warrant such\nnotification/corrective action/follow-up measures. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 47\n4.5.13. ADVERSE ACTION NOTICES While informal resolution is always preferred, failure to meet\ncontract requirements require immediate attention and may, if\nnot corrected, necessitate an adverse action notice from the CO\nor the COTR directing the contractor to cure the problem. Only\nthe CO, with concurrence of legal staff, is authorized to issue\nan adverse action notice (Cure Notice). Ordinarily, this\nnotice is only issued when recommended by Community corrections.",

Ordinarily, this\nnotice is only issued when recommended by Community corrections. The COTR may take an adverse action by withholding an appropriate\namount of funds from the contractor, under the Inspection of\nService Clause, FAR 52.246-4. Withholding When a contractor fails to perform in accordance with the\nStatement of Work the COTR may withhold an appropriate amount of\nfunds from the contractor. In most cases, the performance\nproblems have been brought to the attention of the contractor\nverbally, in monitoring reports, and through other\ncorrespondence. A withholding of funds is usually the final\naction before a cure notice is issued by the contracting officer. Before the COTR sends the withholding letter to the contractor,\nthe circumstances should be discussed with the Central Office\nCommunity Corrections Contracting Sections Chief. If all\nconcerned agree that the proposed withholding is appropriate the\nCOTR may send the withholding letter to the contractor. Cure Notice\nThe CCM (COTR) must submit the request for a Cure Notice in\nwritten memorandum and forward it, express mail, if necessary,\nthrough the MCA, CCRA and CCA, to the CO. The request must be\nvery specific, thoroughly descriptive, and cite specific\nprovisions of the contract (chapter, page, and paragraph of the\nSOW, proposal, etc.). A discussion outlining when the contractor\nwas notified of the problem; how much time was allowed to correct\nthe matter; and the state of the non-compliance with the terms of\nthe contract, as it currently exists, must be included. If a reviewer (MCA, CCRA, CCA, or legal staff) or the CO find\nthe request unwarranted, a written explanation of the rationale\nand recommended course of action(s) shall be returned to the\nprevious reviewer(s) and to the CCM, with the original request.

PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 4, Page 48 After the CO issues a Cure Notice, and the specified time period\nlapses, an on-site inspection is typically required to evaluate\nwhether the contractor has corrected the problem(s). A written\nreport of the findings of the inspection shall be provided to the\nCO through the MCA, CCRA, and CCA. Failure on\nthe part of the contractor to correct the problem(s) may result\nin termination of the contract. 4.5.14. TERMINATIONS A recommendation for termination by the CCM shall be made only\nafter an appropriate Cure Notice has been issued by the CO, and\nafter legal staff and the CO have reviewed and concurred. A\ntermination is used after all other efforts have failed.

These matters will be brought to the attention of\nthe contractor and handled as any other violation of the\ncontract's terms and conditions. However, the Office of Internal\nAffairs (OIA) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) must be\ninformed of all misconduct allegations. Timely reporting of all\nincidents and allegations is of paramount importance. 2. PROCEDURES: A.\nAny information alleging staff misconduct violations of\nstate, local, or Federal law must be reported to the OIG/OIA. In\naddition to the following, please refer to Program Statement\n1210.11 Internal Affairs, Office of, for guidance. The CCM will notify OIA, without delay, of the\nallegation\nfollowed by the SENTRY Electronic Mail System (EMS) notification\n(see attached form), with copies of the EMS and predicating\ndocumentation (memorandums, etc.) mailed or sent via fax within\n24 hours to OIA. A copy of the EMS notification will be sent to\nthe staff member in the Community Corrections Branch Contracting Section (CCB), Community Corrections and Detention\nDivision, responsible for tracking community correction center\n(CCC) integrity issues. Frequently, staff become aware of unconfirmed information\nalleging violations of the Standards of Conduct from unreliable\nsources. When this occurs, the COS or designated staff member\nwill begin to gather preliminary data to assist in a\ndetermination whether a violation of the Standards of Conduct (or\nother contract requirements) may have occurred. However, it is\nimportant to note that \"subjects\" of the allegation(s) should not\nbe approached without OIA approval. If the allegation is clearly\ndetermined to be insignificant and/or without merit, a memorandum\nor GroupWise e-mail documenting the results of the preliminary\nreview shall be sent to OIA. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nAttachment 4-12, Page 2\nOIA will refer all misconduct allegations to OIG for screening and\nclassification (OIA will refer criminal matters involving\ninmate physical abuse and sexual contact [which would constitute\nthe prosecutable offense of deprivation of civil rights under 18\nU.S.C. 242] with an inmate to the Department of Justice, Civil\nRights Division (CRD), for prosecutorial consideration). OIG may\ndecide to investigate a potential criminal violation or serious\nadministrative infraction rather than deferring the matter to the\nBOP. If this should occur, the respective CCM will be notified and\nunless directed otherwise, no further local investigative action\nshould be pursued. Upon deferral, OIA will inform the CCM either not to proceed,\npending further review, or to proceed with a local investigation. All blocks on the attached EMS form shall be completed unless\nobtaining the information would jeopardize an investigation. In\nthis case, the form shall be appropriately noted. If instructed to proceed with a local investigation, the COS or\ndesignated staff member will begin to gather information or evidence\n(newspaper articles, letters, police reports, telephonic\nverifications with state and/or local officials, interviews, etc.)\nthat assist in a determination whether a violation of the Standards\nof Conduct (or other contract requirements) has occurred.",

RESEARCH A.\nInformation concerning all integrity allegations will\nbe entered into the OIA computer database. the number of integrity/misconduct allegations\n(sustained or unsubstantiated);\n! the types of integrity/misconduct allegations\n(fraternizing, gambling, sex related, etc.)\n! expenditures of resources (travel costs, interviews,\ninspections, other financial expenditures, etc.);\n!\nannual trends within each CCM office area; and,\n!\nsuggestions on how to prevent the circumstances leading\nto the integrity issue.\n! Through these guidelines, it is anticipated the BOP can more\neffectively and efficiently utilize existing resources to\nsatisfactorily resolve contract staff misconduct.

Community corrections staff perform many functions for offenders\nin contract facilities that would be performed by case/unit\nmanagers in federal institutions. Therefore, CCMs must have a\nworking knowledge of case management practices and procedures. 5.1. DESIGNATIONS Detailed instructions for completing the Inmate Load and Security\nDesignation form (BP-S337.051) are contained in the Security\nDesignation and Custody Classification Manual. In addition, the\nCCM shall be guided by the procedures outlined below. As the first Bureau employees to be involved with federal\ninmates, CCMs must decide whether to designate a non-federal or\nfederal facility. It is important for the CCM to review initial\ndesignation cases to determine whether they qualify for\ncommunity-based programs. Ordinarily, offenders with court recommendations to serve their\nsentences in a particular non-federal facility shall be placed\nthere. Generally, these cases are reviewed biennially. State\nplacement cases also require a biennial review. After the designation is finalized, the CCM shall inform the U.S.\nMarshals Service (USMS) who has responsibility for transporting\nthe inmate to the designated facility. When the case is a\nvoluntary surrender, the USMS is to notify the inmate where and\nwhen to report. In these situations, local notification\nprocedures may be established with the USMS and United States\nProbation Service (USPS). The BP-S337 Remarks section should be used to comment on the\nnature of the offense, violent or unusual behavior, mental health\nor medical problems, escape history, threatening behavior toward\nnational leaders, and criminal sexual behavior. If an item is\nscored in any portion of the form, a brief explanation should be\nincluded in the Remarks section of the BP-S337. If significant\nconcerns are involved or there has been serious misconduct while\nin pre-trial status, it may be necessary to submit a separate\nmemorandum via BOPNet GroupWise to the Designator briefly\noutlining the circumstances. Inmates with physical or mental\nhealth concerns shall be referred directly to the Central Office\nMedical Designator using appropriate comments in the Remarks\nsection. PS 7300.09\nCN-2 5/19/99\nChapter 5, Page 2 If the USMS requests designation and it is determined the\nsentence has already been completed (i.e., satisfied by jail\ncredit), a designation shall not be done. However, it is\nnecessary for community corrections staff to do a complete\nsentence computation even if the J&C indicates \"Time Served\"; an\nindependent sentence computation will not suffice. Once the\ncomputation is completed it must also be satisfied (e.g., the\ndate, time, and method of actual release must be entered). In the Remarks section of the sentence computation, the CCM shall\nindicate that a sentence computation was completed on a released\nUSMS prisoner and list what documents were used to do the\nsentence computation. For example: released USMS prisoner (129,\nPSI, J&C). During the initial designation process, community corrections\nstaff must perform an independent sentence computation using the\nSENTRY \"Independent Sentence Computation\" transaction for each\ninmate serving a sentence of one year or less. Good judgment\nshall be used to determine if this is needed for inmates serving\nsentences over one year when it appears the inmate has less than\none year remaining. Performing independent sentence computations\non such cases will help ensure proper consideration of jail time\ncredit during initial designation, thereby reducing the potential\nfor late releases.",

Performing independent sentence computations\non such cases will help ensure proper consideration of jail time\ncredit during initial designation, thereby reducing the potential\nfor late releases. All available 129s, PSIs, and prior sentence computations are to\nbe reviewed. The CCM shall also complete an ARS history\ntransaction to determine whether an inmate spent any pre-trial\ntime in a Bureau institution. After completing the independent sentence computation on cases\nthat meet the criteria and consulting with the LIE on jail credit\naccuracy, the CCM shall place a note under the Remarks section of\nthe BP-S337 indicating the tentative release date (TRD) with\nnumber of days jail time credit (JTC). For example: TRD w/292\nJTC= 06-22-95. This will alert the Designator and staff at the\ninstitution of the short release date. This information shall be\navailable to holdover facilities, the USMS, and other staff with\naccess to SENTRY. When notifying the USMS of the designated institution, the CCM\nshould also highlight the short release date. The USMS may have\nto hold locally and eventually release the inmate if the date is\ntoo close for transfer to the designated facility. This decision\nrests with the USMS. If background information (pre or post sentence investigation)\nhas not been completed, the CCM shall conduct an NCIC/NLETS check PS 7300.09\nCN-2 5/19/99\nChapter 5, Page 3\nand annotate in the BP-S337 Remarks section. The inmate must be\ndesignated to at least a LOW security level institution. Due to strict requirements for medical confidentiality, knowledge\nregarding HIV-infected offenders shall be limited to staff with a\nneed to know. In order to maintain confidentiality, community\ncorrections staff shall communicate this information to the\nmedical designator in a separate memorandum via BOPNet. 5.1.1.\nPlacement of Inmates with Mental Health Issues or\nHistories of Suicidal Behavior To reduce the possibility of inmate suicides in contract\ndetention facilities:\na.\nEach CCM or COS shall review their contract detention\nfacilities regarding mental health and suicide prevention\npractices to determine their ability to deal with this\npopulation. Ordinarily, jail-type facilities that have ACA\naccreditation or state certification have acceptable suicide\nprevention programs. However, the Bureau cannot rely entirely on\nthis information. CCMs and/or COSs must base their conclusions\nupon sound correctional practice. In addition to accreditation\nand certification, key factors to look for when conducting the\nsurvey include:\nsuicide and mental health training for staff,\nheightened supervision for high-risk inmates,\navailability of emergency resuscitative equipment,\navailability of mental health professionals at the\nfacility, and\ne\nformal policies and procedures governing their\npractices. e\ne\ne\ne b.\nDuring the designation process, sensitivity must be\ngiven to an inmate's prior mental health concerns or history of\nsuicidal behavior. If such a history exists, a Bureau\ninstitution, or a contract facility capable of dealing with this\ntype of inmate, shall be designated. c. It is critical that contract facilities contact CCM\nstaff whenever an inmate shows evidence of suicidal tendencies,\nor demonstrates any unusual or dangerous behavior. The CCM shall\ncarefully review this information and consult with the MCA, the\nCCRA, and Bureau mental health staff, such as the regional\npsychology services administrator, to determine if the inmate\nshould remain at the facility or be transferred.

Early Designation for Inmates in State Custody When prisoners are within 30 days of release from state sentences\nand a federal term of incarceration is to follow, community\ncorrections staff shall act upon requests for designations from\nthe USMS. Community corrections staff shall contact a state\nemployee for a verbal report on the inmate\u2019s offense conduct and\ninstitutional adjustment (to include incident report history) as\nit applies to the designation process. They must also confirm\nthe scheduled release date before requesting designation. The\nUSMS must provide documentation verifying the sentence is\ncomplete. For procedures to follow for inmates with concurrent federal and\nstate sentences, refer to the Program Statement on Designation of\nState Institution for Service of Federal Sentence. 5.1.3. Voluntary Surrenders The courts allow some inmates to surrender voluntarily to\ndesignated facilities. If the court does not establish a date,\nthe CCM shall contact the USMS to establish a surrender date. If\nthe USMS does not establish a date, the CCM may do so. When the\nCCM becomes aware of a change in a date of voluntary surrender,\nhe or she shall notify the regional designator and the Inmate\nSystems Manager (ISM) at the designated institution via BOPNet. Contract facilities shall be notified of surrender date changes\nby telephone or mail. Documentation of this notification must be\nmaintained until the voluntary surrender has occurred.

REFERRALS FOR INSTITUTION TRANSFER TO CCCs The Bureau's goal is to provide release preparation services to\nall inmates who have need of such services and who meet\nrequirements for placement in the community. Refer to the\nProgram Statement on Community Corrections Center (CCC)\nUtilization and Transfer Procedure and the Security Designation\nand Custody Classification Manual. Bureau institution staff submit standard referrals to CCMs for\nrelease preparation placement in CCCs. CCC referral procedures\nallow the CCM to set an appropriate placement date within the\nrange the referring institution requested. CCMs should also\nreview referrals to determine whether the inmate qualifies for PS 7300.09\nCN-2 5/19/99\nChapter 5, Page 6\nother community-based programs (home confinement, drug treatment,\netc). 5.2.1. Special Cases a.\nMilitary prisoners who will release directly from Bureau\ninstitutions may be transferred to contract CCCs. Other military\nprisoners, including military supervision cases, may not. b.\nState prisoners boarded in Bureau institutions are not\neligible for placement in Bureau contract facilities. 5.2.2. Procedures Upon receiving a completed CCC referral package, the CCM shall\nexpedite one copy to the appropriate CCC, accompanied by a cover\nmemorandum recommending a placement date and listing any special\nprogram requirements. The CCM shall indicate a specific\nplacement date based upon known resources. A response from the\nCCC is expected after receipt of the referral package.

CCMs shall add the\ndestination assignment to the inmate's SENTRY record. The\neffective date of the assignment will be the approved transfer\ndate. The scheduled transfer date should allow the institution\nat least 10 working days to process the release paperwork. If\nthe date is subsequently altered or canceled, CCMs must modify\nthe effective date or delete the assignment and notify the\ninstitution. b.\nRejection. When a CCC does not accept an inmate, the\nCCC Director must write to the CCM outlining the reasons. The\nCCM shall review the rejection to determine if it is justifiable\nand not based on a lack of information. The CCM may want to\ndiscuss the rejection with the CCC Director for reconsideration.

Contractors must collect the full subsistence due. Partial weeks\nof residence are prorated. Contractors shall reduce the monthly\nbilling to the Bureau by the amount collected in subsistence. An\ninmate who fails to pay subsistence may have privileges withheld\nor disciplinary action may be taken, including termination from\nthe program. Unless otherwise indicated by the court,\nsupervision cases shall pay subsistence. Additionally, any\ninmate who transfers to the home confinement component of the\nprogram is not required to pay subsistence. If the court indicates that subsistence should not be collected,\nthe CCM shall comply with the court's order. If the court has\nmade it known that they do not consider it appropriate to collect\nsubsistence on a direct commitment, the CCM should treat this\nlike any other judicial recommendation, that is, look at the\nmerits of the case and make every effort to make a sound\ndecision. If the CCM determines not to follow the court's\nrecommendation, a letter of explanation must be sent. Absent a\ncourt order, offenders are responsible for subsistence payments\nas outlined in this section. Pretrial defendants in a CCC are not restricted from paying\nsubsistence. The CCM should ensure that contractors work closely\nwith the local pretrial services office to determine which, if\nany, pretrial defendant(s) should pay. The subsistence program applies to all offenders assigned to\ncommunity-based programs. In cases of extreme hardship, CCMs may waive or modify subsistence\npayments on a case-by-case basis, with the MCA's concurrence. Ordinarily, obligations including fines, restitution, or court\ncosts shall not be considered a factor when granting waivers. Extreme hardship is defined as a situation PS 7300.09\nCN-2 5/19/99\nChapter 5, Page 31\nwhen the offender has made every effort to establish a suitable\nrelease plan, but, due to circumstances beyond his or her\ncontrol, has been unable to prior to release. Examples of such\nsituations include homelessness, unemployment due to physical or\nmental health reasons, unexpected or emergency critical health\ncare needs, or no community resources. To be considered for a modification or waiver of subsistence, the\noffender must submit to the contractor a written justification\nalong with a financial statement to include a listing of all\ndebts and assets. The contractor shall forward the offender's\nrequest to the CCM with its recommendation.",

Subsistence shall be\nwaived/modified for inmates who have been assessed a Cost of\nIncarceration Fee.\nRefer to the Program Statement on Cost of\nIncarceration Fee.\n5.13.2. Social Security Payments to Offenders Both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 and implementing language in 20 CFR 404.468\nprovide the following guidance on this issue:\nConvicted felons are not entitled to receive Social Security\nbenefits for any part of any month of which the individual\nis confined. For definitional purposes, confinement means\nas long as the individual is under a sentence of confinement\nand has not been released due to parole or pardon. It\nshould be noted that benefit payments to any other person\nwho is entitled on the basis of the prisoner's wages and\nself-employment income are payable as though the prisoner\nwere receiving benefits. The Social Security Administration has held that the regulation\nmeans offenders are not entitled to benefits if they are\ntransferred from an institution to a CCC, home confinement, or\nany other program if their sentences are still running and they\nhave not been released from custody. Exception: Disability benefits may be allowed to individuals\nparticipating in a vocational rehabilitation program that the\ncourt and the Social Security Administration approves. 5.13.3. Employment One of the most important purposes of CCC placement is employment\nassistance. Contractors are to ensure that offenders begin\nworking as soon as possible and must assist those who need help\nin finding employment. Most offenders are expected to be\nemployed within 15 working days of arrival at a CCC. PS 7300.09\nCN-2 5/19/99\nChapter 5, Page 32\nCCMs must encourage contractors to develop programs that increase\nprivileges for pre-release component offenders who are employed. It is generally appropriate for contractors to require offenders\nto be employed before allowing them to be absent from the CCC for\nsocial purposes. Contractors may take disciplinary sanctions\nagainst offenders who are able, but unwilling, to hold\nemployment. Bureau policy and the SOW require that employers be notified of\nan inmate's legal status (that they have been convicted of a\nfederal offense). This policy applies to supervision (public\nlaw) cases also, but such cases are under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt or U.S. Parole Commission and probation officers may\ndetermine that an exception is appropriate. CCMs must ensure\nthat contractors implement the policy in all other cases. Notifications should be made prior to employment of the offender\nif possible. 5.13.4. Authorized Absences Contractors may allow a pre-release component inmate to \"sign out\"\nfrom the CCC until evening curfew, and go on pass for weekends and\nholidays. A furlough is required when the inmate\nwill be gone for more than a weekend (including holidays) and/or\nthe destination is more than 100 miles. Furloughs require USPO\ncomment (both in the district the inmate will be visiting as well\nas where the CCC is located, if not the same), CCM approval, and\nCIM clearance if appropriate.",

The USPO shall Religious Activities In meeting offenders' religious needs in CCCs, staff must\nexercise flexibility. If possible, offenders should be allowed\nuninterrupted practice of religion, as was exercised prior to\nincarceration. Requests for religious activities should be\nhandled on a case-by-case basis. The regional chaplaincy\nadministrator should be contacted for guidance when there are\nunusual requests or concerns. 5.13.6. Driving Often it is appropriate to allow inmates to drive their own or\nanother person's vehicle to travel to work or for other\nauthorized purposes. Inmate requests for driving privileges are PS 7300.09\nCN-2 5/19/99\nChapter 5, Page 33\nsubject to contractor and CCM approval, under the following\nconditions:\na.\nPublic transportation is not available or its use would\nbe impractical considering time, distance, or cost. b. The inmate has provided proof of driver's license,\nvehicle licensing, registration, and valid insurance (if required\nby the state) to the CCM via the contractor. The contractor\nshall maintain copies of these documents (except for the driver's\nlicense, which many states prohibit copying). The contractor\nshall record the driver's license number and expiration date in\nthe inmate's file. c. If the vehicle to be used is the property of a person\nother than the inmate, the contractor must have verified proof\n(e.g., copy of documents) of valid insurance, vehicle licensing\nand registration for the car, and a signed authorization (either\nnotarized or witnessed by CCC staff) permitting the inmate to\ndrive the car. d. The contractor shall maintain the license number and a\ndescription of the vehicle on file. e.\nPermission to drive for supervision cases must be\napproved by the CCC Director and the USPO, and must be\nappropriately documented. f. The contractor shall use the form \"Authorization To\nOperate A Motor Vehicle\" (Attachment 5-4) when an inmate is\napplying for this privilege or a locally produced one which\ncontains, at a minimum, that information found on Attachment 5-3.\n5.13.7. Marriage Contractors shall refer committed inmates' requests for marriage\nto CCMs, with their recommendations. The CCM shall process\nmarriage requests in accordance with the Program Statement on\nMarriages of Inmates, which authorizes the CCM to approve\nrequests to marry of federal inmates housed in non-federal\nfacilities. Marriage requests of offenders under supervision\nshall be forwarded to the USPO. 5.13.8. Electronic Communication Equipment With the advancement of technology and the use of beepers and\ncellular phones in the workplace, there is a need to monitor the\nuse of this equipment by CCC offenders. When CCC staff believes PS 7300.09\nCN-2 5/19/99\nChapter 5, Page 34\nthat it is essential for an offender to use a beeper or cellular\nphone in their work, the following procedures shall be used:\na.

The CCM\nshall contact the MCA or CCRA regarding information contained in\nthis Manual, or the Executive Assistant, Correctional Programs\nDivision, Central Office. 5.14. RELEASE PROCEDURES CCMs shall ensure the timely release of inmates from contract\nCCCs and contract jails or boarding facilities. CCMs must verify\nrelease data, including credit for CCC good time. CCMs shall\ncalculate release dates for direct court commitments and date\nchanges for institution transfers if additional or forfeited good\ntime occurs. CCMs shall mail a copy of appropriate sentence\ncomputation data to CCCs and boarding facilities of the inmate. CCMs shall establish a system to monitor release dates and ensure\ncontract staff release inmates timely and accurately prepare\nrelease paperwork. The following schedules outline the steps and time limits\napplicable to each type of release from confinement. Reference\nshall also be made to the Inmate Systems Management Manual. CCMs\nshall ensure that contract staff are aware of these schedules and\nthat contractors understand the different requirements for\nrelease.

This practice also applies to releases on parole unless the\nrelease date is the parole eligibility date. 5.14.1. Release Schedule a.\nParole. Six weeks prior to parole date, contract staff\nsubmit a proposed parole plan to the USPO for investigation and\napproval. Four weeks prior to parole date, contract staff submit a request\nfor a parole certificate to the appropriate U.S. Parole\nCommission office, with the USPO approval attached. b.\nMandatory Release. Four to six weeks prior to mandatory\nrelease date, contract staff submit a proposed release plan to\nthe USPO (Mandatory Release Statement (Attachment 5-4d). c.\nSupervision Cases.

Fines/Assessments (Old Law Cases) A fine is a monetary penalty associated with an offense that is\nimposed as a part of a judgment. The two types of fines are\ncommitted and non-committed fines. See Attachments 5-6 and 5-7. A\ncommitted fine is paid or other arrangements are made for the\nhandling of the fine prior to the inmate's release. A noncommitted fine is one where the status of payment of the fine\nwould not affect the release date. See the Program Statement on\nFines and Costs.

The court is required to impose an assessment on\nconvicted defendants for each felony and misdemeanor. The\nassessment is imposed for each count (offense) in the Judgment in\na Criminal Case. Agents of the court collect the assessments. b. The CCM shall indicate on the SENTRY Sentence\nComputation Record the existence of assessments for direct court\ncommitments. The information is recorded only if it is contained\nin the Judgment in a Criminal Case. Otherwise, it need not be\nrecorded and the CCM need not solicit the information from the\ncourt. c. The CCM ordinarily does not become involved with the\ncollection of assessments and is not required to determine\nwhether they have been paid. However, if the Judgment in a\nCriminal Case for a direct court commitment indicates that the\nassessment was not paid at sentencing, and that the court wants\nit collected prior to release and provides no special\ninstructions, the unpaid assessment must be treated as a\ncommitted fine. If the court, either in the Judgment in a\nCriminal Case or by court order, requires that the fine be paid\nby some other method that involves the Bureau, the CCM should\ncontact the Regional Inmate Systems Administrator for assistance. 5.14.5. Release Expenses Inmates serving long sentences in non-federal facilities\n(primarily in state correctional facilities and juvenile\nfacilities) may receive a release gratuity, transportation to the\nplace of conviction or legal residence, and clothing. An inmate\nwho has adequate personal funds or is released to another custody\nshould not usually receive a gratuity. Because of the nature of\nthe program, inmates released from contract residential centers\nshall not normally receive release gratuities. See the Program\nStatements on Release Gratuities, Transportation, and Clothing\nand the Interagency Agreement between the U.S. Bureau of Prisons\nand the U.S. Marshals Service.\na.

This includes aliens and\nthose confined to contract jails. Note that the Cost of Incarceration Fee, which is imposed by the\nBureau, is distinct from the Cost of Incarceration Fine, which is\nimposed by the courts. The Program Statement delineates the\ndifferences between these obligations. At no time will both be\nimposed on one inmate. When appropriate, the CCM shall compute the fee, establish a\npayment schedule in accordance with the COIF Program Statement,\nand notify all direct court commitments under their jurisdiction\nwho owe a COIF using the appropriate COIF Program Statement\nAttachment. Inmates who are institution transfers shall continue\nthe installment plans established by their unit teams. In the\ncase of an inmate owing a COIF who transfers to a CCC, the CCM is\nnotified of the COIF balance by regional correctional programs\nstaff immediately after they receive notification from the\ninstitution. Institution notification must be forwarded no later\nthan two weeks prior to transfer.

Subsistence shall be waived for institution transfers whose COIF\npayments are greater than or equal to subsistence. When COIF is\nless than the calculated subsistence obligations, the difference\nmay be collected as subsistence. Direct court commitments with a\nCOIF are to have subsistence waived. 5.16. SEXUAL ABUSE/ASSAULT PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION CCMs shall ensure that contractors have procedures in place to\nprevent and address incidents of sexual abuse/assault. This\nincludes informing inmates, training contract staff, and\nfollowing correct reporting procedures. Specific requirements\nare found in the most recent Community Corrections SOW. The\nProgram Statement on Sexual Abuse/Assault Prevention and\nIntervention Programs can also be referenced. 5.16.1 Informing Inmates Inmates transferring to a contract facility from a federal\ninstitution have already been educated on preventing and avoiding\nsexual abuse/assault. Contractors must provide this education to\nall other federal inmates and document it in their files. All\ninmates are to be advised during facility orientation who to\ncontact regarding incidents of sexual abuse/assault.

All other contractors shall be encouraged to use\nvolunteers. Volunteers are defined as private citizens who are at least 18\nyears old and provide gratuitous services to the facility. Gratuitous services are those that are uncompensated and would\notherwise not be performed by a paid employee. Volunteers\nreinforce mainstream societal values conveyed daily by staff\nthrough service in programs addressing areas such as marriage and\nfamily enrichment, substance abuse, education, literacy,\nspiritual growth, recreation, health education, fitness, and\nvocational training. Volunteers who provide services under the direct supervision of\npaid contract staff do not need security background clearances. Those who provide services without supervision must complete the\nApplication for Volunteer Service (BP-S580.053) and Release of\nInformation (OMB 3206-0007) forms and have NCIC, NLETS, and\nfingerprint checks. The contractor must forward this information\nto the CCM for approval. Responses must be received from the\nNCIC, NLETS, and fingerprint checks before approval can be\ngranted for unsupervised volunteers. Further information and guidance regarding these procedures can\nbe received from the regional volunteer administrator.

Many of the procedures which apply to community corrections\noperations are found in the Inmate Systems Management Manual and\nSentence Computation Manuals (Old Law and CCCA of 1984] as well\nas the Technical Reference Manuals on SENTRY General Use, SENTRY\nEducation, and SENTRY Sentence Monitoring. Staff shall use these\nmanuals and the Community Corrections Technical Reference Manual\n(TRM) for general instruction. Certain procedures may require modification for community\ncorrections application, and others may not be relevant at all. Central Office Inmate Systems and Community Corrections\nAdministrators and Information Systems staff shall make\ninterpretations or modifications in procedures when necessary. CCMs must establish and maintain official records for federal\noffenders in contract facilities. Such records, including SENTRY\ninformation, are considered confidential and are protected within\nthe scope of the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act. See\nthe Program Statement on Release of Information. 6.1. FILE MAINTENANCE AND DISPOSAL It is Bureau policy to maintain records for all offenders\ncommitted to the custody of the Attorney General and the Bureau. CCMs shall use files to record all aspects of an offender's\nconfinement in the contract location for service of sentence or\nas a condition of supervision. The Inmate Systems Management\nManual contains instructions for Judgement and Commitment file\ncreation, maintenance and disposal. The Program Statement on\nCentral File, Privacy Folder, and Parole Mini-Files contains\ninstructions for file creation, maintenance, and security. 6.1.1.

SENTRY APPLICATIONS\nSENTRY is an invaluable management tool at all levels. It provides\nstatistical population data for budgetary decisions at the\nregional and national levels and aids in contractor bill\nverification locally. SENTRY information may also be used to\nidentify the particular phase of a program in which an inmate is\nparticipating. It cannot be emphasized enough to keep the data\nupdated as this information is only valuable if it is current and\naccurate. Assignments designed for community corrections are described in\nthe Community Corrections TRM. Other important functions are\nfound in the SENTRY General Use TRM. A few standard applications\nare discussed below:\n6.3.1. Location Code There shall be a separate IIS Location Identifier Code (LOC CODE)\nfor each contract location. All offenders admitted to contract\nlocations shall receive a location assignment (LOC) (e.g., 4XW). This includes INS parolees. When an inmate who has been\ntemporarily released from a facility is readmitted, SENTRY will\nreadmit them to the previous location assignment. These codes\nare created through the ADP contract information procedures. See\nChapter 4 and Attachment 4-17 for additional information. 6.3.2. Inmate Movement Admissions, releases, and status changes (e.g.,transfer to home\nconfinement) must be updated the day the activity occurs, or the\nnext work day if occurring after normal business hours. 6.3.3. Admission and Release Codes",

Inmate Movement Admissions, releases, and status changes (e.g.,transfer to home\nconfinement) must be updated the day the activity occurs, or the\nnext work day if occurring after normal business hours. 6.3.3. Admission and Release Codes Admission and release codes are standard and listed in the SENTRY\nGeneral Use TRM, Part 2, Code Tables, as ARS category codes. Codes specific to community corrections may be found in the\nCommunity Corrections TRM. Admission and release codes should\ncoincide with the type of activity and correspond with\nappropriate COM assignments. All INS parolees admitted to contract locations shall have the PS 7300.09\nCN-2 5/19/99\nChapter 6, Page 9\nARS assignment A-INS. All INS commitments have the community\ncorrections (COM) assignment of \"CUBAN\" indicating a Mariel Cuban\noffender whose INS parolee status requires placement in a CCC. The SENTRY release code \"INS REMOVE\" is always used for INS\nparolees released from contract facilities. CCMs must ensure support staff understand what codes to use and\nhow to interpret them correctly. 6.3.4. Escape Codes The SENTRY release code ESCAPE is used for an escape from custody. The codes ESC TECH N and ESC TECH O are used for\ntechnical escapes, where the N stands for new criminal behavior\nand the O for old criminal behavior. For example, if an inmate\nattempts to obtain a driver's license (a legal activity) and the\nname check reveals an old warrant for which he or she is arrested\nand jailed, this is ESC TECH O. On the other hand, if the inmate\nis stopped for speeding and an old warrant is located so he or\nshe is jailed, this is ESC TECH N, since speeding is a new\nillegal activity. 6.3.5. Home Confinement Transfer When an inmate is placed on home confinement, the ARS status is\nchanged. However, transfer orders are required only when the\ninmate moves to a different location (\"LOC\"). Examples of when\nit is required include transfer from a contractor that does not\nprovide the service to one that does or to U.S. Probation's home\nconfinement program. Then, the inmate is to be transferred from\nthe current \"LOC\" and admitted to the new \"LOC\" - this changes\nthe \"ARS Date.\" The inmate's WLS assignments should be checked\nbefore the transfer transaction, as these will have to be\nreentered using the SENTRY \u201cUpdate Inmate Assignment\u201d\ntransaction. 6.3.6. COM Category Community corrections field staff shall ensure that the SENTRY\nCOM category is complete and accurate. Assignments related to\ntype of commitment, aftercare needs of the offender, CCC denial\ncategory, ICC, CSC, Juvenile, and MINT are described in the\nCommunity Corrections TRM. PS 7300.09\nCN-2 5/19/99\nChapter 6, Page 10\n6.3.7 Community Transitional Drug Abuse Treatment (TDAT) The CCRA shall determine which staff (CCM or TDAT Coordinator)\nare responsible for loading the SENTRY assignments for inmates in\nTDAT. Refer to the Program Statement on Community Transitional\nDrug Abuse Treatment and the Community Corrections TRM for\nfurther direction on these assignments. 6.3.8. SENTRY Monitoring Data The SENTRY \"General Census/Roster Display\" transaction may be used\nin a variety of ways to monitor offenders, case management\nactivity data accuracy, and administrative status.",

SENTRY Monitoring Data The SENTRY \"General Census/Roster Display\" transaction may be used\nin a variety of ways to monitor offenders, case management\nactivity data accuracy, and administrative status. Also, the\nContract Location Profile System (CLP) provides data for\nmonitoring contract activities and staff must update it each time\nsome action - inspection, suspension, new contract, etc. - is\ntaken on a contract. CCMs, MCAs, and CCRAs must be familiar with\nthe details of these and other SENTRY transactions to provide\nproper management oversight of these activities. The Community Corrections TRM provides samples of SENTRY\ntransactions as examples of monitoring techniques used to ensure\nthe accuracy of SENTRY data during monthly SENTRY monitorings\nconducted by CCRAs. Accurate data is important in the\ndevelopment of new community corrections initiatives, long range\nplanning, and in the identification of internal weaknesses. 6.4. SENTRY SENTENCE MONITORING APPLICATIONS Sentence computation is the mathematical method of determining\nrelease dates, parole eligibility dates, etc., for offenders\nserving sentences. SENTRY sentence modules have been automated to\nthe extent that, except for complex computations, the Legal\nInstruments Examiner need only key accurate data to obtain\ncorrect results. CCM's must ensure an accurate computation data\nrecord is in SENTRY and on file for all offenders under their\nresponsibility. Reference the SENTRY Sentence Monitoring TRM. 6.4.1.\nSENTRY Sentence Computation Procedure for Direct Court\nCommitments, Condition of Supervision Cases, and Supervision\nViolators.\na. Prior to calculation of any sentence, computation data\nand documents must be assembled and reviewed. The necessary\ninformation and documentation includes but is not limited to the\nJ&C Order, USM-129 Detention Record, and the PSI. If the inmate\nwas in a federal pretrial facility, the SENTRY ARS history should\nalso be reviewed. For violators, prior sentence computations\nmust be reviewed to identify any over-served time which is PS 7300.09\nCN-2 5/19/99\nChapter 6, Page 11\ncreditable toward the new term. b. After review of computation data, the sentence should be\ncomputed using the sentence monitoring computation transactions. The regional inmate systems specialist or administrator should be\nconsulted for assistance on complex computations (i.e., long-term\nboarders and juveniles). c. An audit for accuracy is conducted after the computation\nis completed. The original paper copy, a SENTRY printout, shall\nbe placed in the inmate's file, and copies shall be sent to the\ncontractor, inmate, and U.S. Parole Commission, if applicable. The official computation in the file must be signed and dated by\nthe individual completing it and the staff member performing the\naudit. See the Inmate Systems Management Manual. Documentation\nof distribution of copies is to be maintained in the file. d. The sentence computation must be completed within the\ntime frames specified in the Inmate Systems Management Manual. The amount of jail credit must be reviewed immediately upon\nplacement to ensure that a late release does not occur. 6.4.2.\nTransfers Sentence Computation Data Review for Institution a.\nThe institution Inmate Systems Manager shall perform a\nfull audit of the sentence computation comparable to a release\naudit prior to an inmate\u2019s transfer to a CCC.

BUDGET DEVELOPMENT OVERVIEW The Bureau's budget development phase begins approximately 18\nmonths before the start of the fiscal year. During this time,\nmanagement identifies initiatives (major projects and new\nprograms) to be included in the Bureau's budget request. Once\nthe Director has approved the initiatives, their projected cost\nis added to the prior year's budget. This results in the\nBureau's proposed operating budget for that fiscal year. It is imperative that CCMs and MCAs prepare sound, realistic\nprojections to ensure funds are provided for the accomplishment\nof program goals and objectives. Usually in March, the Community\nCorrections Branch (CCB) requests that CCRAs submit their budget\nprojections for the fiscal year 18 months away. Field staff then\nbegin the process of identifying budget requirements. The CCRA\nanalyzes all data from the field and submits it to the Central\nOffice CCB for submission to the Budget Development Branch in the\nBureau's Administration Division. The Budget Development Branch compiles budget figures from all\nBureau components along with detailed narrative descriptions and\njustifications of Bureau programs and initiatives into a document\nknown as the Spring Planning Submission. This is forwarded to\nthe Department of Justice (DOJ) to be included as a line item in\nthe Congressional Budget.",

After review by Office of Management\nand Budget (OMB), the Budget Development Branch prepares the\nbudget for final review by the President and submits it to\nCongress. When an appropriations bill is passed by Congress and signed by\nthe President, the allotment procedure begins. The Central\nOffice Budget Execution Branch distributes funding for the\nRegion's fiscal year allocation. 7.2. AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY Community corrections is responsible for the following budget\nareas:\nContract Community Corrections Centers - Program ! T1;\nContract Confinement - Program D with its' three\nparts: jails D1, long-term adult boarders D2, and juveniles D3;\n! PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 7, Page 2\n! Community Corrections Management - Program R1; and ! Transitional Services - Program 2021. The Central Office CCB, in conjunction with the Budget Execution\nBranch, is responsible for the initial allocation and transfer of\nfunds between regions and programs. Program T1 and D funds are\noccasionally moved from one program to the other. Funds may not\nbe transferred between programs without written approval of the\nCentral Office CCB. For the purposes of management, Program R1\nis always kept separate. R1 funds normally cannot be transferred\nto the T1 or D programs. CCMs submit estimated annual expenditures for each of their\ncontracts. They are responsible for projecting future budget\nneeds, estimating inmate-days and annual costs for contracts and\nfor monitoring budget expenditures. These budget projections are\nthen submitted to the MCA. The CCM is ultimately responsible for\nthe management of Program T1 and D monies in conjunction with the\nRegional Comptroller\nThe MCAs have oversight responsibility for CCM tracking of budget\nallocations and expenditures and for reviewing the budget\nprojections submitted by the CCM. The MCA consolidates these\nbudget requests and submits them to the CCRA. MCAs are also\nresponsible for the Community Corrections Management Center\nbudget, Program R1, which funds CCM office training, travel, and\nsupplies. The Central Office has no involvement with the\nCommunity Corrections Management Center budget. Each CCRA makes a request for their region\u2019s upcoming fiscal year\nto the Central Office based on budget projections received from\nthe MCAs. After the CCRA receives their allocation, funds are\ndistributed to the MCAs. The MCA then disburses funds to each\nCCM office. 7.3. BUDGET PLANS AND REPORTS\n7.3.1. Spring Planning Submission The budget process, also known as Spring Call, begins in late\nFebruary or early March, 18 months in advance of the fiscal year. At this time, projections, program initiatives, and workload data\npertaining to contract confinement needs two years into the\nfuture are identified and compiled by the CCB. A narrative is\nthen submitted to the Budget Development Branch. The Budget Development Branch prepares this information for\ninclusion in the Bureau's funding request to Congress. Before PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 7, Page 3\nCongress receives this request, DOJ and OMB review it closely and\nmay require additional information to support the request before it\nis reviewed by Congress.",

Both the House and the Senate review the\nBureau's budget request and may decide to change requested amounts\nprior to passing it to the President for final approval. The\nbudget projection process must begin well in advance of when the\nfunds are actually needed as this process takes over a year. 7.3.2. Annual Budget Plans A Community Corrections annual budget plan is required to prepare\nand identify budget needs for the next fiscal year. Each CCRA is\nrequired to submit a completed annual budget plan to the CCB by\nJuly 15 of each year. One section of the annual plan gives projections for Contract CCCs\n(T1) and another section gives projections for total contract\nconfinement (D), including jails (D1), long-term adult boarders\n(D2) and juveniles (D3). Each section includes inmate-days and the\nper capita cost used to arrive at the requested budget, plus a\nnarrative on any program or other change affecting the budget. The CCB submits an operating plan by region and program based on\nestablished funding levels provided by the Budget Execution Branch. Budget Execution uses this to allocate funding by the appropriate\nprogram and object class codes to the Regional office. The CCB\nthen informs the CCRA of his or her allocation for the upcoming\nfiscal year. 7.3.3. Budget Projection Process The budget projection process is essentially the same when\nformulating both the spring planning submission and the annual\nbudget plan. The main difference is that the spring call goes to\nthe Bureau Budget Development Branch for use in requesting funds\nfrom Congress while the annual budget plan goes to the Bureau\nBudget Execution Branch after the funds have been granted by\nCongress. Budget Execution uses the annual budget plan to\ndistribute funds to each region. A general description of the process community corrections staff\nuse to project future fiscal needs is described below:\n(a)\nCCMs submit budget projections to the MCA on Attachment\n7-2, CCM Budget Projections, using the Budget Projection\nJustification Worksheet for each contract. This worksheet is\nfound in the Community Corrections Technical Reference Manual. Working papers are also submitted to the MCA and are filed\nwith these Attachments. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 7, Page 4 To accomplish this, CCMs calculate their projections taking into\naccount the number of offenders to be serviced, average length of\nstay, and per capita rate for both contract confinement and\ncommunity corrections centers budgets for each contract. Details on trends, unique situations, and\nadditional variables affecting one or both of these programs also\nmust be taken into consideration. A narrative\nexplanation is required for any significant factors considered or\nchanges made from the Spring Call figures submitted a year\nearlier. (b)\nThe MCA verifies the calculations and the process the\nCCM used to prepare projections. This is accomplished using\nthe Verification section of Attachment 7-2, CCM Budget\nProjections. The MCA also compares the actual costs and\ntotal inmate-days used during the current year to ensure the CCM\u2019s\nbudget projections are sound.",

Monthly Budget Reports In order to monitor the community corrections budget on a\nnational level, CCRAs submit the following two monthly budget\nsummary reports found in BOPDOCs, via BOPNET Groupwise, by the\n25th of each month to the CCB:\nMonthly Contract CCC Budget Summary (EMS Form 904). This form is used to report Program T1 figures. ! ! 903). Monthly Contract Confinement Budget Summary (EMS Form This form is used to report Program D figures.

Accrued\nbills that have been processed will be adjusted and entered into\nthe yearly total.\n! 7.3.5. Tracking Contract Expenditures The Central Office CCB allots CCRAs a budget for each fiscal\nyear in Programs T1 and D.\nCCRAs allocate funds to each\nManagement Center for their field offices to track contract\nexpenditures. CCMs must use the spreadsheet issued by the Central Office, CCB\nOperations Section to record, monitor, and track expenditures by\ncontract and totals by CCCs (T1) and Confinement (D).\nMCAs\nmaintain oversight of the tracking of these expenditures. CCRAs\nmust be kept appraised of any circumstances in which there is a\nsignificant surplus or deficit in funds. CCRAs will review and\nmake a determination on the appropriate action to be taken. 7.4. ACCRUALS In accordance with current accounting policy, at the beginning of\neach fiscal year, CCMs submit annual accruals for each contract\nto Financial Management to be distributed across the next twelve\nmonths as appropriate. CCMs make allotments to each contract\nbased on their annual disbursement received from the MCA. The\nfollowing instructions for this process are to be followed:\n1.\nAt the beginning of each fiscal year, the CCM office\nwill submit an annual accrual for each contract facility based on\ntheir annual budget request submitted in June. The annual\naccruals are submitted to financial management through the MCA\nand CCRA.

Therefore,\nit is essential that staff perform legitimate, detailed projections\neach year for each contract, track accruals against expenditures\nmonthly, and make adjustments as necessary. 7.5. CONTRACTOR BILLINGS An invoice is the bill or written request of payment the contractor\nprovides for services rendered. Payments are based on a proper\ninvoice and satisfactory performance of contract terms. The MCA\nand CCRA must monitor bill processing closely to ensure CCMs follow\nproper procedures and process bills in a timely manner. Specific\nprocedures related to bill verification and certification are found\nin the Community Corrections Technical Reference Manual. CCMs must certify that services presented for payment have been\nrendered. This must be done within five working days following\nreceipt of an accurate bill. All bills are date-stamped with the\ndate received and are reviewed promptly to determine if they are\naccurate. Incorrect billings shall be returned to the contractor\nfor correction. The CCM shall maintain documentation to show the\ndate bills are received as well as the date bills are returned to\nthe contractor for corrections. When billings are determined to be accurate, the CCM approves\npayment by signing the voucher (SF-1034) and forwarding it along\nwith a copy of the billing to the CCRA within 5 days of receipt. The CCRA then initials or signs the voucher and forwards it to the\nOffice of Financial Management. If the contractor collects 25% of subsistence from the resident,\nthe CCM must ensure the billing calculations reflect the amount of\nthese collections and that the Bureau receives credit for them. Further information regarding subsistence is found in Chapter 5.\n7.5.1.

Release Expenses Non-subsistence costs, such as release expenses, which are not\nincluded in the contract rate may be paid by the contractor and\nreimbursed by the Bureau. The appropriate sub-object code is\nlisted separately on the contractor's invoice when processing the\nbills. For example, if the U.S. Marshals Service pays for a\nBureau inmate serving a sentence in a jail, a SF-1080 is\nsubmitted to the CCM for processing. See the Program Statements on Interagency Agreement Between the\nBureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service; and Release\nGratuities, Transportation, & Clothing, as well as Chapter 5 of\nthis manual for further information. 7.6. MANAGEMENT OF THE OPERATIONS BUDGET The MCA is responsible for managing and tracking Program R1,\nOperations Budget. CCRAs track R1, review and consolidate the\nMCA/CCM requests, and submit their budget requests for regional\noperating expenses to their Regional Comptroller. CCRAs\ndistribute R1 funds to the MCA who manages the R1 Program\nexpenditures for the Management Center district. 7.6.1. Annual Budget Plan for CCM/MCA Offices CCRAs shall advise their CCMs/MCAs when to submit an annual\nbudget plan for the approaching fiscal year. This budget is for\nthe operation of the CCM/MCA office and is finalized through the\nRegional Comptroller. Information on travel, office equipment,\nsupplies and other office operating expenses such as copier\nrental, telephone, etc., is included. The CCM/MCA shall include\nall equipment purchases for the Fiscal Year (furniture, office\nmachines, etc.) in this projection. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 7, Page 8\n7.6.2. Travel The MCA and CCM project and plan travel on a monthly, as well as\nannual basis. Based upon the annual allotment, the CCRA\nallocates a specific amount of money for travel to each MCA. In all cases, care must be exercised in planning and/or\napproving travel to ensure the travel is prudent, required as\npart of the traveling employee's responsibilities, and\nincorporates the most economic and advantageous method and time\nof travel. The Regional Director authorizes all travel. A travel\nauthorization is issued to travelers before each actual trip\noutside a 50-mile radius. The appropriate accounting\nclassification and the estimated amount of the travel must be\nstated on all travel authorizations. The CCRA forwards all\ntravel authorizations to Financial Management. Ordinarily, each MCA, CCM, and COS will use the government issued\ncredit card for travel purposes. Within five working days of\ntravel completion, the travel voucher must be submitted to\nFinancial Management. Vouchers claiming reimbursement costs for\nofficial travel are submitted to the MCA/CCRA for approval using\nthe form authorized by Financial Management. Staff shall submit\nthe original travel authorization with lodging receipts and any\nother receipts deemed appropriate. These attachments shall\naccompany the travel voucher submitted to the MCA/CCRA for\napproval and further payment processing. Local travel within a 50-mile radius incurred by MCAs, CCMs and\nCOSs using privately owned vehicles (POVs) in and around official\nduty stations (i.e., visits to a local contract facility, USM,\nUSPO, etc.) is claimed on the Miscellaneous Expenses (SF-1164)\nand does not require a travel authorization.

Office Expenditures Office supplies, printed stationery, Post Office Box rental,\ntelephone costs, etc., relating to CC office operations may be\npurchased with the government credit card. All expenditures,\nboth anticipated and actual, for CCM and MCA offices are routed\nthrough the CCRA who is the Cost Center Manager for community\ncorrections budgets. Major capitalized equipment needs require the submission of a\nRequest for Purchase Form (BP-S101.041) and a Major Equipment PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 7, Page 9\nJustification Form (BP-S135.041) to the CCRA. Minor equipment\nneeds (non-capitalized) require only the Request for Purchase form\nand, if approved by the CCRA, are forwarded to the Regional\nProcurement Officer for issuance of a Purchase Order, BP-ACCT-81. Day-to-day purchases must be made with the government credit card. Exceptions to this rule and complete details on the use of\nthe credit card are found in the Program Statement on Bureau of\nPrisons Acquisitions (subpart 13.601-70) and the Procurement\nTechnical Reference Manual. In general, the procedure for using\nthe card begins with the purchaser determining if the needed item\nis available from a mandatory source. Once mandatory sources have\nbeen screened, the purchaser locates a vendor and verifies the\nprice. Vendor selection is made on the basis of the best price or\nvalue to the government and may be accomplished either by telephone\nor in person. All purchase orders, requests for purchase, and invoices require an\naccount class code as found in Financial Management regulations. Upon receipt of an invoice and verification of services and/or\nsupplies received, the CCM or MCA shall stamp and sign approval of\ncharges claimed and forward the forms to the CCRA for further\nprocessing and payment. Payment can only be made after approval of\na valid invoice. Payment cannot be issued based on receipt of a\nstatement. 7.7. ACCOUNTING AND CONTRACTING PROCEDURES AND CODES:\n7.7.1. Introduction The Appropriation Bill is an authorization by a Congressional Act\nfor an agency to make payments from the U.S. Treasury for specified\npurposes. The two main appropriations administered by the Bureau\nare:\nthe Salaries and Expenses (S&E) Appropriation, a \"one-year\nappropriation\" available for incurring obligations only during a\nspecified fiscal year. Most community corrections funding\nis contained in this appropriation, with some coming from the\nViolent Crime Reduction Program (VCRP); and\nthe Buildings and Facilities (B&F) Appropriation, a\n\"no-year appropriation\" available for incurring obligations\nfor an indefinite period of time. Specific codes are used to track the Bureau\u2019s expenditures of\nCongressionally- appropriated funds. These codes are entered into\nthe Financial Management System (FMIS) which is the vehicle used to\nkeep track of the appropriation and expenditure of funds by various\nunits and programs within the Bureau. PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 7, Page 10\n7.7.2. Monitoring Budget Activity It is important to monitor the FMIS reports and check on any\nsignificant discrepancies between the FMIS figures and the CCRA\nfigures. CCRAs cross check their tracking systems (the three\nprograms described below) against FMIS official figures on a\nquarterly basis. 7.7.3. Programs Program Codes are used to identify functions or activities\nconducted by the Bureau with funds specifically allocated for\nthat activity or function. The Program Code is a single letter.",

Programs Program Codes are used to identify functions or activities\nconducted by the Bureau with funds specifically allocated for\nthat activity or function. The Program Code is a single letter. Program Codes used in community corrections (and described at the\nbeginning of this chapter) are:\nContract Community Correction Centers = T1\nContract Confinement = D\nCommunity Corrections Management = R1\nTransitional Services = 2021\n7.7.4. Codes Each of the programs above also has a YRegDoc number which is a\n10-digit (or 12-digit in Program Review) code placed on all\nfunding or obligating documents such as contracts, Purchase\nOrders, and invoices. The codes are later entered into the FMIS. The Community Corrections Technical Reference Manual contains a\ndescription of what each part of the accounting classification\ncode means and how it is used by community corrections staff. It\nis the responsibility of the CCRA, MCA and CCM to ensure these\ncodes are accurate. To assist, the following lists should be\nobtained from the Regional Office of Financial Management on a\nregular basis:\n1. Bureau of Prisons FMIS/FMS Institution Codes,\n2. Key to Classification Level Codes,\n3. Program Area Codes,\n4. Key to FMIS/FMS Sub-Object Codes. 7.8. CONTRACT NUMBERS AND CODING\n7.8.1. Contract Numbers and Purchase Orders Each obligating document must have a document control number\nwhich is a two-part entry. This is a YRegDoc number and an\nAccountClass code. This remains with the contract, without PS 7300.09\n1/12/98\nChapter 7, Page 11\nregard to fiscal year, for the life time of the contract, or\nuntil the contract is canceled or allowed to expire. Purchase\norders, on the other hand, are valid for one fiscal year or less\nand only for the fiscal year in which issued. Refer to the Community Corrections Technical Reference Manual\nfor examples. 7.8.2. Location Code In addition to the contract number, each separate contract\nlocation is assigned a three digit identification code by the\nCCRA. This location code remains with the unit, and will remain\neven when the contract is inactive and no longer used by the\nGovernment. This code cannot be used again.
