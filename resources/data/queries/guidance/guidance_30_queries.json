According to the COPS Office, community policing is a philosophy that promotes\norganizational strategies that support the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to\nproactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as violent crime, nonviolent\ncrime, and fear of crime.",

The award start date indicated on the award document means that your agency may be reimbursed for any\nallowable costs incurred on or after this date. The duration of your CPD award is listed on your award document. Your award number is in the following format: 2018-XXXX-XXXX for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 awards. The COPS Office\ntracks award information based upon this number. Therefore, it is important to have your agency\u2019s award number\n(or your agency\u2019s ORI number) readily available when corresponding with the COPS Office. 2 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nYour originating agency identifier (ORI) number begins with your state abbreviation followed by five numbers or\nletters (e.g., VA00000). This number is assigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for use in tracking\ninformation for the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The COPS Office tracks programmatic award information based\nupon this ORI number. If you have any questions regarding your award, please refer to your award number or your\nagency\u2019s ORI number when you contact the COPS Office. Your Office of Justice Programs (OJP) vendor number, in most circumstances, is your agency\u2019s nine- or thirteendigit federal tax identification number assigned to you by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If your OJP vendor\nnumber differs from your tax identification number, the OJP vendor number is only to be used for administrative\npurposes in connection with this program, and should not be used for IRS purposes.

Your agency should keep timely and accurate records of all\ntravel expenses. If at any time these costs change, you should immediately contact your COPS Office Program\nManager. Contracts/Consultants\nContracts include goods or services that directly contribute to the implementation or enhancement of the project. The applicant should distinguish clearly between subawards and contracts in allocating any funds to other entities. Pursuant to 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.330, a subaward is for the purpose of carrying out a portion of the federal award, and a\ncontract is for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the recipient\u2019s own use. The substance of the\nrelationship is more important than the form of the agreement in determining whether the recipient of the passthrough funds is a subrecipient or a contractor. Keep in mind that the awarding and monitoring of contracts must\nfollow documented procurement procedures, including full and open competition, pursuant to the procurement\nstandards in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.317- 200.326, and the issuance of subawards must meet the requirements of 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\n200.331.

All sole-source procurements of goods and services (those not awarded competitively) in excess of $250,000\nrequire prior approval from the COPS Office.

These costs should not be reflected in the \u201cPersonnel\u201d or \u201cTravel\u201d\ncategories. All other consultant-related expenses should be included in this section such as supply and equipment requests. The same guidelines as previously stated in the above sections will apply. If an applicant proposes a program or activity that would deliver services or benefits to individuals, the costs of\ntaking reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to those services or benefits for individuals with limited\nEnglish proficiency may be allowable. Reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to services or benefits may\ninclude interpretation or translation services, where appropriate. For additional information, see the \u201cCivil Rights\nCompliance.\u201d Other costs Items that do not conform to any of the category descriptions specific above but that have a direct correlation to\nthe overall success of a recipient\u2019s project objectives and are necessary for the project to reach full\nimplementation will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the COPS Office. If at any time you are unsure if an item is considered allowable or unallowable, please contact your COPS Office\nProgram Manager for further assistance. Indirect costs\nIndirect (facilities and administrative, or F&A) costs are costs incurred for a common or joint purpose that are not\nreadily assignable to a particular project but are necessary to the operation of the agency and the performance of\nthe project. Indirect costs are allowable for this program, but must adhere to the standards set forth in the\napplicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance as stated in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 (Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards) as adopted by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 2800.101. Examples of indirect costs include those incurred for facility\noperation and maintenance, depreciation, and administrative salaries. Indirect cost rates are federally negotiated and approved rates that are based on audited and documented\nexpenses approved to be included within an indirect cost rate. It is important that your agency carefully track and\nupdate its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office award period.",

It is important that your agency carefully track and\nupdate its indirect cost rate during the COPS Office award period. The recipient understands that if they were approved for indirect costs based on an expired indirect cost rate at\nthe time of application, a special condition may have been added to the award prohibiting the drawdown of funds\nfor reimbursement of indirect costs until a current indirect cost rate has been determined by their cognizant\nagency and a copy of the \u201cnew\u201d approved and signed Indirect Cost Negotiation Agreement has been submitted to\nthe COPS Office. 8 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual The recipient understands that indirect costs may typically only be requested at the time of application. Transferring funds into or out of the indirect cost category is not allowable without prior approval from the COPS\nOffice. A budget modification is required. If your agency\u2019s approved indirect cost rate expires during the award period, a current approved rate must be\nsubmitted to the COPS Office in order to continue to draw down award funding for indirect costs. Your expired\nrate must be renegotiated or extended by your cognizant federal agency. An approved indirect cost rate may be\nextended one time for up to four years, and once the cognizant federal agency has approved your extension, you\nmust abide by that rate for the agreed-upon time period. At the end of the extension period, you must renegotiate\na new indirect cost rate. Your agency must advise the COPS Office in writing of any changes to your approved\nindirect cost rate during the award period and must request a budget modification with the COPS Office to reflect\nany rate change. In addition, if a provisional indirect cost rate is in effect at award closeout, your agency shall proceed with\ncloseout, but you will need to complete an expenditure analysis upon receipt of the approved final indirect cost\nrate to determine if an adjustment is necessary. If your agency drew down excess COPS Office funding for indirect\ncosts, then your agency must return the overpayment to the COPS Office and submit a revised Federal Financial\nReport (SF-425). If your agency incurred additional indirect costs, then your agency may request a budget\nmodification if the award is still open and award funds are available. If your agency returns or draws down COPS\nOffice funding, then your agency will need to submit a revised final Federal Financial Report (SF-425). See the COPS Office website for a fact sheet on indirect costs:\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2018AwardDocs/cpd/Indirect_Cost_Rate_Fact_Sheet.pdf.

Supplementing, Not Supplanting\nCondition:\nState, local, and tribal government recipients must use award funds to supplement, and not supplant, state, local,\nor Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funds that are already committed or otherwise would have been committed for\naward purposes (hiring, training, purchases, and/or activities) during the award period. In other words, state, local,\nand tribal government recipients may not use COPS Office funds to supplant (replace) state, local, or BIA funds that\nwould have been dedicated to the COPS Office-funded item(s) in the absence of the COPS Office award. 34 U.S.C. \u00a7\n10384. 9 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Why this condition: The COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates that award funds not be used to replace state or\nlocal funds (or, for tribal recipients, BIA funds) that would, in the absence of federal aid, be made available for the\naward purposes. What you should do: For state, local, and tribal recipients, CPD funds may not be used to pay for any item or cost funded under the\naward (equipment, personnel, training, etc.) if that item or cost was otherwise budgeted with state, local, or BIA\nfunds. In addition, recipients may not reallocate state, local, or BIA funds already budgeted for award purposes as\na result of receiving CPD award funds. If you have questions concerning this award term and how it pertains to\nyour project budget, please contact your COPS Office Program Manager. 5. Extensions\nCondition:\nYour agency may request an extension of the award period to receive additional time to implement your award\nprogram. Such extensions do not provide additional funding. Only those recipients that can provide a reasonable\njustification for delays will be granted no-cost extensions. Extension requests must be received prior to the end date\nof the award. 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.308(d)(2). Why this condition:\nUnder federal regulations, requests to extend the award period require prior written approval from the COPS\nOffice. Without an approved extension, your agency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs\nincurred beyond the official award end date. When justified, the COPS Office will seek to accommodate reasonable\nrequests for no-cost time extensions to fully implement the COPS Office award. What you should do: The COPS Office will contact your agency during the last quarter of the award period to determine whether a nocost time extension is needed. Requests to extend the award period must be received by the COPS Office before\nthe official award end date. Failure to submit a request for a no-cost time extension before the award end date\nmay result in the immediate deobligation of any remaining award funds. Please note that the project period of\nperformance will be extended, if necessary, until the deliverable is considered final.",

If the award is set to expire,\nprior to the final approval of the deliverable, a no-cost extension will be executed for a reasonable amount of time\nfor the recipient to complete the final deliverable. 6. Modifications\nCondition:\nAward modifications under the CPD program are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\n200.308. For federal awards in excess of $250,000, any modification request involving the reallocation of funding\nbetween budget categories that exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent (10%) of the total approved budget 10 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nrequires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Regardless of the federal award amount or budget modification\npercentage, any reallocation of funding is limited to approved budget categories. In addition, any budget\nmodification that changes the scope of the project requires prior written approval by the COPS Office. Why this condition:\nThe COPS Office realizes that agencies may need to reprogram award funds. Acceptable examples of such award\nmodifications include purchasing additional equipment using cost-savings from approved items or purchasing a\ndifferent type of equipment due to changing needs. Under federal regulations, you are required to expend federal\nfunds only as approved in the FCM. Requests to change or alter an award that meet certain threshold\nrequirements must be submitted to the COPS Office for written approval, prior to their purchase or\nimplementation. Without prior written approval, you must continue to implement your award as it was originally\noutlined and accepted by your agency. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered within the\noriginal scope of the award. Please be advised that reprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved. Your agency may reprogram its budget up to an aggregate (over the course of your project) of 10 percent of the\ntotal project cost without prior written approval from the COPS Office. However, you should notify your COPS\nOffice Program Manager of any reprogramming that falls below the 10 percent threshold as well. For awards in\nexcess of $250,000, any reprogramming of funds that totals an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the approved\nbudget requires prior written approval from the COPS Office. What you should do: You are required to notify your COPS Office Program Manager if you determine that your agency will need to\nreprogram award funds. If your modification exceeds an aggregated (over the course of your project) 10 percent of\nyour overall award, your agency must access https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. Please contact your COPS Office Program Manager for further direction on any additional requirements that may\napply to your modification request. The COPS Office will then evaluate your request and notify your agency of our\ndecision in writing. Implementation of the modified award budget may begin following written approval from the\nCOPS Office.",

Please note that modification approvals for active awards will be accompanied by a modified FCM\nreflecting the approved changes. 7. Evaluations\nCondition:\nThe COPS Office may conduct monitoring or sponsor national evaluations of its award programs. The recipient\nagrees to cooperate with the monitors and evaluators. 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10385(b). Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that evaluations of the program may be\ncarried out or commissioned by the attorney general for the furtherance of the purposes of the act. The COPS\nOffice conducts evaluations to determine which programs are working, how programs may be improved, and why\ncertain programs are more successful than others. Specifically, the COPS Office may assess the way in which your\nagency implements its CPD award. COPS Office staff or evaluators may study the effectiveness of funded\nprograms, projects, and activities. Evaluators may collect information about the programs\u2019 effect on crime, victims 11 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nof crime, and the quality of life in communities. In addition, they may ask questions about the challenges\nencountered during project implementation, how residents feel about community policing, and how police feel\nabout their work. This information will be useful to other communities and police agencies across the country. What you should do: When evaluations are undertaken, you may be contacted in writing with specific requests for information. In\ngeneral, evaluators may need to speak with individuals in your agency or department, observe activities, and\nobtain written reports about and from your agency or department. You will be asked to facilitate any site visits and\ninformation-gathering activities. In addition, you will be asked to provide accurate and timely information about\nyour award activities. You should fully comply with any requests made regarding these evaluations. 8. Reports/Performance Goals\nCondition: To assist the COPS Office in monitoring and tracking the performance of your award, your agency will be\nresponsible for submitting quarterly programmatic progress reports that describe project activities during the\nreporting period and quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard Form 425 (SF-425). 2 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 200.327 \u2013\n200.328. The progress report is used to track your agency\u2019s progress toward implementing community policing\nstrategies and to collect data to gauge the effectiveness of increasing your agency\u2019s community policing capacity\nthrough COPS Office funding. The Federal Financial Report is used to track the expenditures of the recipient\u2019s award\nfunds on a cumulative basis throughout the life of the award. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 and other federal regulations and policies\nrequire that financial assistance provided by the Federal Government must be monitored carefully to ensure the\nproper use of federal funds. In addition, the COPS Office seeks to document, on a continuing basis, the progress of\nour programs and recipients. What you should do:",

What you should do: This award condition is designed to make your agency aware of reporting requirements associated with CPD\nawards. Quarterly programmatic progress reports and a final programmatic closeout report must be submitted\ndirectly to the COPS Office through the \u201cAccount Access\u201d tab on the COPS Office website at\nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov. Your agency is also required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports using Standard\nForm 425 (SF-425) within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. A final SF-425 will be due within 90 days\nafter the end of the award period. This report reflects the actual cumulative federal expenditures incurred during\nthe funding period, and the remaining unobligated balance of federal funds. Under federal regulations, your\nagency is not permitted to draw down federal funding for costs incurred after the official award end date;\nhowever, you will have a 90-day grace period after the award end date during which you can drawdown funds for\neligible expenditures incurred before the award end date. Agencies with more than one delinquent programmatic\nor financial report submission per fiscal year may be subject to delays in receiving reimbursement for allowable\nexpenses and may be required to receive technical assistance to improve compliance with reporting. These reports\nare discussed in greater detail in the section titled \u201cReports\u201d in this manual. All reports should be submitted within\nthe deadlines given to avoid suspension or possible termination of award funds or other remedial actions; failure\nto submit required reports may also impact future funding opportunities. 12 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual 9. Award Monitoring Activities\nCondition:\nFederal law requires that recipients receiving federal funding from the COPS Office must be monitored to ensure\ncompliance with their award conditions and other applicable statutory regulations. The COPS Office is also\ninterested in tracking the progress of our programs and the advancement of community policing. Both aspects of\naward implementation\u2014compliance and programmatic benefits\u2014are part of the monitoring process coordinated\nby the U.S. Department of Justice. Award monitoring activities conducted by the COPS Office include site visits,\noffice-based grant reviews, alleged noncompliance reviews, financial and programmatic reporting, and audit\nresolution. As a COPS Office award recipient, you agree to cooperate with and respond to any requests for\ninformation pertaining to your award. This includes all financial records, such as general accounting ledgers and all\nsupporting documents. All information pertinent to the implementation of the award is subject to agency review\nthroughout the life of the award, during the close-out process and for three-years after submission of the final\nexpenditure report. 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10385(a) and 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.333 and 200.336. Why this condition:\nThe Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 states that each award program must contain a\nmonitoring component. The COPS Office actively monitors how recipients are complying with COPS Office award\nrequirements. In addition, the monitoring component provides customer service and technical assistance to help\nensure recipients understand how to remain in compliance while implementing their awards.

What you should do: Your agency may be required to accommodate routine and nonroutine efforts by the COPS Office, or an entity\ndesignated by the COPS Office, to examine your agency\u2019s use of federal funds both programmatically and\nfinancially. The four primary means of ensuring recipients\u2019 compliance with the terms and conditions of their\nawards are as follows:\nSite visits. The COPS Office strategically selects award recipients based on a variety of risk factors to conduct site\nvisits to ensure compliance with award terms and conditions. The purpose of site visits is threefold:\n\u2022 To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award\n\u2022 To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies\n\u2022 To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, recipients will be notified in writing in advance with detailed instructions for how to\nprepare for the review of their COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a period\nof one or more days. Recipients will have an opportunity to resolve any identified noncompliance\nissues while on-site or, if necessary, following the site visit. In addition, recipients will also have an\nopportunity to seek customer service and/or technical assistance on the implementation of their\naward. 13 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nEnhanced Office-Based Grant Reviews (EOBGR). In lieu of a site visit, awards may be selected for an EOBGR\nconducted at the COPS Office via teleconference or video conference. EOBGRs serve as an alternative for\nconducting award monitoring reviews in support of the COPS Office\u2019s overall award monitoring strategy. The\npurpose of the EOBGR is threefold:\n1.\n2.\n3. To review for compliance with the terms and conditions of the award To review the recipient\u2019s community policing strategies To provide customer service and technical assistance If selected, the recipient will be notified in writing in advance of any EOBGR of its COPS Office awards. This review is generally performed over a one- to two-day period. Recipients will have an opportunity\nto resolve any identified noncompliance issues, if necessary, following the EOBGR interview. In\naddition, award recipients will also have an opportunity to seek customer service and/or technical\nassistance on the implementation of their award. Alleged Noncompliance Referral (ANCR). An ANCR is an allegation of suspected noncompliance that originates\nfrom an internal source within the COPS Office or an external referral from one of many sources. Internal ANCRs\ngenerally originate from COPS Office Grants Administration Division, COPS Office Finance Division, or the COPS\nOffice Legal Division, although any COPS Office component may refer a noncompliance issue to the ANCR. External\nnoncompliance referrals may be received from anonymous complainants, media, citizens, law enforcement\nagencies, other Federal agencies, or other outside sources. On a case-by-case basis, COPS Office ANCR staff\nmembers determine the appropriate course of action to take to investigate complaints of alleged noncompliance. This may include phone or letter contact or a site visit by COPS Office staff or the OIG.",

Audit liaison. The OIG may conduct a random audit for any recipient of a COPS Office award. In the event your\nagency has undergone an OIG audit and there are audit recommendations (findings) resulting from noncompliance\nor poor accountability practices, the COPS Office Audit Liaison Section will work with your agency to resolve and\nclose these recommendations. Remedies to close recommendations may include repayment of award funds,\nproviding adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance, or providing proof of policies or procedures that\nwere created or revised to directly address the causes for the noncompliance as a proactive preventative measure\nto avoid future noncompliance. Recipients are responsible for remedying any award noncompliance that is identified during site visits, EOBGRs,\nand/or ANCRs. In addition, recipients are responsible for remedying noncompliance stemming from audit\nrecommendations identified in audits of COPS Office awards conducted by the OIG and the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer (OCFO). Remedies for noncompliance may include but are not limited to repayment of award\nfunds for unallowable or unsupported costs, providing adequate documentation to demonstrate compliance,\nsuspending active award funding, voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of remaining award funds,\nor a restriction from receiving future COPS Office awards for a period of time. Under certain conditions, additional\nactions may include referral and placement on the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s High Risk List, which will include\nmandatory completion of the Office of Justice Programs Financial Management Training and being subject to\nincreased monitoring of current and future awards while on the list. In the event of criminal misuse of award\nfunds, recipients may also be subject to fines and imprisonment. To avoid findings of noncompliance, recipients\nare strongly encouraged to become familiar with the COPS Office Grant Monitoring Division\u2019s Grant Monitoring\nStandards and Guidelines and Award Owner\u2019s Manual for the year in which the award was made. Recipients 14 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nshould also contact their COPS Office Program Manager at any time during the life of a COPS Office award with\nquestions concerning award conditions, terms, or requirements to seek guidance to avoid noncompliance.

To begin developing a Utilization Report, please consult the OCR's website at\nhttps://ojp.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm and click EEOP Reporting Tool Login. Additional assistance can be found\nonline at the bottom of the same webpage by clicking the EEO Reporting Tool Job Aid and Frequently Asked\nQuestions. If your organization has less than fifty employees or receives an award of less than $25,000 or is a nonprofit\norganization, a medical institution, an educational institution, or an Indian tribe, then it is exempt from the EEOP\nrequirement. To claim the exemption, however, your organization must certify that it is exempt by logging into the\nEEO Reporting Tool on the OCR website at https://ojp.gov/about/ocr/eeop.htm, providing the contact and\norganizational profile information, and then submitting a Certificate of Exemption. 16 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual",

Recipients are responsible for reporting their applicable executive compensation and subaward information, and\nthe award term provides guidance to report the related information as required by FFATA. What you should do: At the time of award application, your agency was asked to ensure that it has the necessary processes and systems\nin place to comply with the applicable subaward and executive compensation reporting requirements should it\nreceive funding. If your agency received awards of $25,000 or more, you are required to report award information\non any first-tier subawards totaling $25,000 or more, and, in certain cases, to report information on the names and\ntotal compensation of the five most highly compensated executives of the recipient and first-tier subrecipients.

Why this condition: In general, recipients are required to procure funded items through open and free competition. However, in some\ninstances, recipients may have already determined that competition is not feasible. What you should do: If you have received an award for an item (or group of items) or service in excess of $250,000 and have already\ndetermined that the award of a contract through a competitive process is infeasible, you must provide a written\njustification that explains why it is necessary to contract noncompetitively. The initial determination that competition is not feasible can be made if one of the following circumstances exists:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Competition is determined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. The COPS Office authorizes noncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the recipient. The item/service is available only from one source. The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive\nsolicitation. The COPS Office will review your request and the supporting information that you provide and will make a\ndetermination as to whether or not an exception can be made to the general rule regarding competition.

This limitation must be applied to all conference related subcontracts and\nsubawards, including those with hotels and travel agents. See 2 C.F.R. Part 200, Appendix III.C.2.\n(Indirect costs\u2014Institutions of Higher Education); 2 C.F.R. Part 200, Appendix IV.B.2.c. (Indirect\ncosts\u2014Nonprofit Organizations); or 2 C.F.R.

Participant Support Costs: Participant support costs are generally excluded from the distribution\nbase. Therefore, indirect costs may not be applied against participant support costs. Participant\nsupport costs are direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel\nallowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (but not\nemployees) in connection with meetings, conferences, symposia, or training projects. See 2 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 200.75. This exclusion applies to the entirety of any subcontracts for the lodging and travel of\nconference participants or trainees (but not employees). Costs related to contractors of the\nrecipient who are acting in the capacity of a \u201cConference Trainer/Instructor/\nPresenter/Facilitator\u201d are considered participant support costs.

Accessing Award Funds This section provides answers to payment-related questions, including all the information needed to provide\naccess to request payments from your COPS awards. For assistance with financial management and award\nadministration, please contact the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 or visit our website at\nwww.cops.usdoj.gov. Payment method What method of payment is used? There is currently one payment system available for accessing federal award funds\u2014the Grant Payment Request\nSystem (GPRS). GPRS is a web-based system that enables recipients to use a secure Internet connection to request\nfunds. Approved payment requests will automatically be scheduled for payment by the United States Department\nof the Treasury through electronic funds transfer (EFT). The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the primary system\nthat agencies use for EFT. An award recipient will be able to review previous payment requests made since July\n2009. For more information regarding GPRS, please visit the following website:\nhttps://ojp.gov/about/offices/ocfogprs.htm. Setting up your account How do we set up a new GPRS account?",

If you are a new award recipient to the COPS Office, your agency should determine which authorized employee(s)\nwill be responsible for requesting federal funds for your COPS Office awards through the GPRS system. The\nindividual(s) selected must click on the following link and register with the GPRS system to become a drawdown\nspecialist for your agency: https://grants.ojp.usdoj.gov/gprs/welcome. All individuals that need access to GPRS\nmust register separately and create their own unique GPRS username account, as these accounts are not meant to\nbe shared. Once you have been approved, you will receive an email containing a temporary password and information on\nhow to use GPRS. Please note that part of the verification process may involve outreach to your Law Enforcement\nExecutive, Government Executive, or other financial points of contact to validate the information that was\nprovided during the registration process. Once you receive your temporary password, you should login to the GPRS\nwebsite and change your temporary password to a permanent password. If you ever have an issue regarding your\nGPRS password, you have the option to utilize the \u201cForgot Password\u201d link on the webpage. It will email you a new\ntemporary password. If this does not work, please contact the GMS Helpdesk (888-549-9901, option 3) for a\npassword reset for GPRS with the username you selected upon registration. DOJ award recipients who already have active GPRS accounts for awards created in the OJP Grants Management\nSystem (GMS) may be instructed to consolidate usernames once their COPS GPRS username is approved and\nbecomes active.

If you have any questions, or wish to verify your ACH\nenrollment form information, please call the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770 and ask to speak with\nyour state assigned Financial Analyst. When should Federal Financial Reports be filed? Current regulations state that all COPS award recipients are required to submit their initial Federal Financial Report\n(FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425) at the end of the period that includes the award start date, regardless of\nwhen the award was accepted, and thereafter, at the end of every calendar quarter, regardless of award activity. This report should reflect actual expenditures and unliquidated obligations incurred by your agency on a\ncumulative basis. You will not be able to make drawdowns from your GPRS account if the SF-425 report for the\nmost recent reporting quarter is not on file with the COPS Office by the deadline date. Recipients are encouraged\nto submit their SF-425 reports via the Internet at https://portal.cops.usdoj.gov. For more information on how to complete and where to submit your quarterly SF-425 report, see the section in\nthis manual titled \u201cReporting Requirements,\u201d beginning on page 65. 56 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nFiling the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) identifies your federal and local expenditures made during that calendar\nquarter. However, to receive actual payment, you must request it through GPRS. Additional payment questions Can we receive advances? Yes. If you receive funds through electronic transfer, the period allowed is 10 days in advance. In general, the\nconcept of \u201cminimum cash on hand\u201d applies to COPS Office awards. This concept requires that your agency\nrequest funds based upon immediate cash disbursement needs. You should time your request for payment to\nensure that federal cash on hand is the minimum that you need. There should be no excess federal award funds on hand, except for advances not exceeding 10 days, as noted\nabove. The Federal Government has four basic rules regarding advances. Advances can be terminated if the recipient\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4. is unwilling or unable to attain project goals;\nmaintains excess cash on hand;\ndoes not adhere to the terms and conditions of the award;\nfails to submit reliable or timely reports.

How often can we request reimbursement of costs? There are no limitations on how often your agency may request reimbursements; however, your reimbursement\nrequests should cover a specific time frame and include only costs that were approved in the Financial Clearance\nMemorandum (FCM). As a general guideline, most agencies request reimbursement on a monthly or quarterly\nbasis. Also, please note that a date range for a reimbursement request can only be used once. Can we earn interest on our award funds? For states, payments are governed by Treasury-State CMIA agreements and default procedures codified at 31\nC.F.R.

For nonfederal entities other than states, payment methods must minimize the time between your drawdown of\nfederal funds and your payment of award costs to avoid earning excess interest on your award funds. You must\naccount for interest earned on advances of federal funds as follows:\n\u2022 The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uniform guidance at 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.305(b)(9) states that\ninterest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts up to $500 per year\nmay be retained by the nonfederal entity for administrative expenses. \u2022 Any interest earned on federal advance payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts that is in excess of\n$500 per year must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment\nManagement System (PMS) through an electronic medium using either Automated Clearing House (ACH)\nnetwork or a Fedwire Funds Service payment. For detailed information on remittance, please see appendices\nfor a full text of the electronic medium remittance options. 57 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\n\u2022 If you do not have access to an electronic medium option, then please make a check payable to \u201cThe\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\u201d and mail the check to Treasury-approved lockbox: HHS Program\nSupport Center, P.O.

Financial Record Maintenance Under the COPS Office CPD Program, your agency is required to establish and maintain accounting systems and\nfinancial records to accurately account for funds awarded and disbursed. These records must include both federal\nfunds and any local funds contributed to this project. Accounting systems and records What accounting systems are required? Your agency needs to establish and maintain accounting systems and financial records to accurately account for\nthe funds awarded. As required by 2.C.F.R. \u00a7 200.62 (Internal control over compliance requirements for federal awards), your\naccounting system should be designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the\nfollowing objectives for federal awards:\n\u2022 Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in order to prepare reliable financial statements and\nfederal reports and to maintain accountability over assets. \u2022 Transactions are executed in compliance with all applicable federal statutes, regulations, and the award\nterms and conditions. \u2022 Funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. What records must be kept? Your agency\u2019s fiscal control and accounting systems should enable you to make accurate, current, and complete\ndisclosure of the financial activity under your CPD award. Your accounting records should contain information\nshowing expenditures under the award and must be supported by items such as payroll records, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, purchase orders, or similar documents. Your agency must adequately safeguard award funds and make sure that they are used for authorized purposes\nonly. Your agency will be responsible for refunding any unallowable expenses. How long must records be kept? All financial records and supporting documents associated with your CPD award (including payroll, time and\nattendance records, canceled checks, and purchase orders) must be retained for a period of three years from the\ndate of submission of the final expenditure report as stated in 2 C.F.R \u00a7C.F.R. \u00a7 200.333 (Retention requirements\nfor records). Your agency should maintain records so that you can identify them by award year or by fiscal year, whichever you\nfind more convenient. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, or other action involving these records has been\nstarted before the end of the three-year period, the records should be kept until completion of the action. These\nrecords should be easily located and should be properly protected against fire or other damage. Failure to\nmaintain adequate records to document award expenditures may result in a requirement to repay all federal funds\nthat cannot be supported with appropriate records. 59 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual What if we have more than one award?",

If your agency has more than one COPS Office award or an award from another federal agency, funds received\nunder one project may not be used to support another project without specific written authorization from the\nCOPS Office, or in the case of an award from another agency, from both awarding agencies. Your accounting\nsystems and financial records must reflect expenditures for each project separately. Who may access our records? Authorized federal representatives, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Comptroller\nGeneral of the United States, the COPS Office, and any entity designated by the COPS Office may access these\nrecords for the purposes of conducting audits, site visits, or other examinations. 60 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual VI. Federal Audit Requirements In addition to oversight by the COPS Office, your award may be subject to an audit by independent examiners. The\ntwo primary types of audit are Single Audit Act (SAA) audits and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) audits. Single Audit Act (SAA) requirements What are the regulations governing SAA requirements? The Single Audit Act (SAA) of 1984 established uniform guidelines for state and local governments receiving federal\nfinancial assistance. The 1984 Act was amended in July 1996, was revised on June 27, 2003 and again on June 26,\n2007, and is effective for fiscal years after December 31, 2003, to reflect revised audit criteria and reporting\nrequirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued final guidance for 2 C.F.R. Part 200\u2014Uniform\nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) on\nDecember 26, 2013. This guidance applies to all federal awards or funding increments awarded on or after\nDecember 26, 2014, and provides additional guidelines regarding the implementation of SAA requirements. 2\nC.F.R. Part 200, Subpart F \u2013 Audit Requirements, available at www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl, establishes the requirements for organizational audits that\napply to COPS Office award recipients. Recipients must arrange for the required organization-wide (not award-byaward) audit in accordance with the requirements of Subpart F. Who must have an SAA audit? A recipient that expends $750,000 or more during the recipient's fiscal year in federal awards must have a single\naudit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.514 (Scope of audit) except when it elects to have a programspecific audit conducted in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.501(c). An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, or\na vendor. SAA audits are conducted annually unless a state or local government is required by constitution or statute, in\neffect on January 1, 1987, to undergo audits less frequently than annually. The primary objective of an SAA audit is\nto express opinions on the recipient\u2019s financial statements, internal controls, major and nonmajor award\nprograms, and compliance with government laws and regulations.",

In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, federal\nagencies and pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in \u00a7200.338 Remedies for\nnoncompliance. See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.505. These sanctions under 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.338 could include the following:\n\u2022 Temporarily withholding cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the nonfederal entity or\nmore severe enforcement action by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. \u2022 Disallowing (that is, denying both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of\nthe activity or action not in compliance. \u2022 Wholly or partly suspending or terminating the federal award. 61 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\n\u2022 Initiating suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized under 2 C.F.R. part 180 and federal awarding\nagency regulations (or in the case of a pass-through entity, recommending such a proceeding be initiated by a\nfederal awarding agency). \u2022 Withholding further federal awards for the project or program. \u2022 Taking other remedies that may be legally available.

Questions and comments regarding SAA audits may be\ndirected to the COPS Office Response Center at 800-421-6770. Office of Inspector General (OIG) recipient audits What is the role of the OIG for award audits? The OIG is a separate component of the U.S. Department of Justice and is independent of the COPS Office. The\nprimary objective of OIG recipient audits is to assess compliance with award terms and conditions. OIG audits are\ndesigned to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds. The OIG audit process promotes efficiency and\neffectiveness in the administration and implementation of awards by evaluating compliance with the terms and\nconditions of awards. How are COPS Office awards selected for an OIG audit? The OIG randomly selects awards to be audited or may conduct a COPS Office recipient audit in response to a\nreferral that the OIG believes warrants further evaluation. The OIG also surveys DOJ award-making agencies on an\nannual basis to solicit input on suggested audit areas for the upcoming fiscal year. In most instances, however, the\nOIG generally selects awards to be audited based on a number of factors, including the geographical distribution of\nawards funded, award amount, population served, award status (active and expired), and type of award (hiring\nand nonhiring).",

The OIG requests award documentation from the COPS Office. \u2022 Entrance conference. The OIG schedules to meet with the recipient to gather documentation and conduct\naudit. \u2022 Draft audit report. The OIG reviews documentation and presents initial recommendations (findings) to the\nrecipient and copies the COPS Office. The COPS Office interacts with the recipient to coordinate any\nrepayments and/or policy or procedure documents to be submitted to the OIG before release of the Final\nAudit Report. \u2022 Final audit report. The OIG has completed its direct interaction with the recipient. The COPS Office directs\nthe recipient to formulate a Corrective Action Plan to address recommendations (findings). As each\nrecommendation is successfully addressed by the recipient, the COPS Office requests closure on the\nrecommendation. \u2022 Closing the audit. When all recommendations have been closed, the COPS Office requests closure on the\naudit from the OIG and notifies the recipient that the audit is closed.

Typical audit findings The OIG has typically reported the following audit findings pertaining to awards as a result of lack of proper\ndocumentation, poor business practices, or inadequate accounting and record keeping systems:\n\u2022 Unallowable costs. Recipient incurred costs that were not approved in the original budget or a budget\nmodification, were in excess of the approved budget, or were charged to the award after the expiration date\nand an award extension was not obtained. \u2022 Unsupported costs. Specific award expenditures and reimbursements could not be supported by adequate\ndocumentation (including but not limited to receipts or purchase orders), that may have been allowable\nunder the program, but for which no prior written approval was obtained from the COPS Office , or award\nexpenditures were in excess of actual approved award costs. \u2022 Lack of complete/timely programmatic and financial reporting.

Reporting Requirements As a CPD award recipient, your agency will be required to submit quarterly Federal Financial Reports as well as\nquarterly Programmatic Progress Reports. Awarded agencies should be prepared to track and report CPD award\nfunding separately from all other funding sources, in order to ensure accurate financial and programmatic\nreporting on a timely basis. Your agency should ensure that you have adequate financial internal controls in place\nto monitor the use of all funding, and also to ensure that its use is consistent with the award terms and conditions. Good stewardship in this area includes written accounting practices, use of an accounting system that adequately\ntracks all award drawdowns and expenditures, and has the ability to track when award-funded positions are filled\nor approved purchases are made. Failure to submit complete reports or submit them in a timely manner may result\nin the suspension and possible termination of your agency\u2019s COPS Office award funding or other remedial actions. Federal Financial Reports Your agency is required to submit a quarterly Federal Financial Report (FFR) using Standard Form 425 (SF-425)\nwithin 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter.

When the Award Period Has Ended At the end of your agency\u2019s CPD award period, the COPS Office is responsible for the closeout of your award. As\npart of this process, the COPS Office requires documentation demonstrating that your agency has met all of the\nprogrammatic and financial requirements of the award. After the end of the award period, your agency will be asked to submit a Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425)\nand any applicable final programmatic progress reports. Final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) The final Federal Financial Report (SF-425) for your award is due to the COPS Office no later than 90 days after the\nend date of the award period. To avoid being delinquent and having your funds frozen, you must submit an SF-425\nreport within the 30 day grace period, even if your final SF-425 is not due yet. You can revise that report to reflect\nyour final actual costs and revise the status as final no later than 90 days after the end date of the award period. The final report should reflect the total amount of allowable federal expenditures that were incurred during the\nlife of the award, as well as the amount of unobligated funds remaining, if any. The federal funds expended should\nreflect only the actual allowable costs incurred relative to the specific program requirements for that award. In\naddition, once you have completed your final drawdown, this report should reconcile with the total amount of\nfederal funds drawn down by your agency. The final SF-425 should also include the required minimum total\namount of local (recipient) cash match contributed, if applicable. When should all of the award monies be spent? Award funds reflecting allowable project costs must be obligated before the end of the award period. Obligated\nfunds cover monies spent, and expenses incurred but not yet paid, for any approved items listed on the FCM. Your\nagency has up to 90 days after the end of the award period to pay for eligible expenses previously incurred, and to\nrequest reimbursement for any remaining eligible balance. You cannot list an accrual on your final SF-425. Request\nan extension if you will not be able to pay for any obligations within the time frames listed above. Please be advised that 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.343(a) requires recipients to submit final SF-425s and 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.343(b)\nrequires recipients to draw down the final reimbursement for expended funds within 90 days after the expiration of\nthe award.",

Your agency should review its\nrecords carefully to ensure that it draws down and expends only the amount required for actual costs incurred\nduring the award period.

Community policing defined\nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of\npartnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to\npublic safety issues such as violent crime, nonviolent crime, and fear of crime. Community policing is composed of three key components:\n1.\n2.\n3. Community partnerships\nOrganizational transformation\nProblem solving Community partnerships\nCommunity partnerships are collaborative partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the individuals\nand organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police. Community policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, encourages interactive\npartnerships with relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is large, and these partnerships can be\nused to accomplish the two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through collaborative problem\nsolving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing and addressing public safety\nproblems. Other government agencies Law enforcement organizations can partner with a number of other government agencies to identify community\nconcerns and offer alternative solutions. Examples of agencies include legislative bodies, prosecutors, probation\nand parole departments, public works departments, neighboring law enforcement agencies, health and human\nservices departments, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members or groups\nIndividuals who live, work, or otherwise have an interest in the community\u2014volunteers, activists, formal and\ninformal community leaders, residents, visitors and tourists, and commuters\u2014are a valuable resource for\nidentifying community concerns. These factions of the community can be engaged in achieving specific goals at\ntown hall meetings, neighborhood association meetings, decentralized offices or storefronts in the community,\nand team beat assignments. Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its behalf\ncan be powerful partners.",

Nonprofits or service providers\nAdvocacy and community-based organizations that provide services to the community and advocate on its behalf\ncan be powerful partners. These groups often work with or are composed of individuals who share common\ninterests and can include such entities as victims groups, service clubs, support groups, issue groups, advocacy\ngroups, community development corporations, and the faith community. 78 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Institutions of Higher Education\nInstitutions of higher education create communities of students, professors, and personnel that are important\nstakeholders. The institutions can also provide resources to law enforcement agencies by assisting with\ncommunication strategies, facilitation of community meetings, data analysis, and research. Private businesses For-profit businesses also have a great stake in the health of the community and can be key partners because they\noften bring considerable resources to bear in addressing problems of mutual concern. Businesses can help identify\nproblems and provide resources for responses, often including their own security technology and community\noutreach. The local chamber of commerce and visitor centers can also assist in disseminating information about\npolice and business partnerships and initiatives, and crime prevention practices. Media The media represent a powerful mechanism by which to communicate with the community. They can assist with\npublicizing community concerns and available solutions, such as services from government or community agencies\nor new laws or codes that will be enforced. In addition, the media can have a significant impact on public\nperceptions of the police, crime problems, and fear of crime. Organizational transformation\nOrganizational transformation is the alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and\ninformation systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem-solving. The community policing philosophy focuses on the way that departments are organized and managed and how the\ninfrastructure can be changed to support the philosophical shift behind community policing. It encourages the\napplication of modern management practices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Community policing\nemphasizes changes in organizational structures to institutionalize its adoption and infuse it throughout the entire\ndepartment, including the way it is managed and organized, its personnel, and its technology. Agency management Under the community policing model, police management infuses community policing ideals throughout the\nagency by making a number of critical changes in climate and culture, leadership, formal labor relations,\ndecentralized decision making and accountability, strategic planning, policing and procedures, organizational\nevaluations, and increased transparency. Climate and culture\nChanging the climate and culture means supporting a proactive orientation that values systematic problem solving\nand partnerships. Formal organizational changes should support the informal networks and communication that\ntake place within agencies to support this orientation. 79 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nLeadership Leaders serve as role models for taking risks and building collaborative relationships to implement community\npolicing, and they use their position to influence and educate others about it.",

Leaders, therefore, must constantly\nemphasize and reinforce community policing\u2019s vision, values, and mission within their organization and support\nand articulate a commitment to community policing as the predominant way of doing business. Labor relations If community policing is going to be effective, police unions and similar forms of organized labor must be a part of\nthe process and function as partners in the adoption of the community policing philosophy. Including labor groups\nin agency changes can ensure support for the changes that are imperative to community policing implementation. Decision making\nCommunity policing calls for decentralization both in command structure and decision making. Decentralized\ndecision making allows front-line officers to take responsibility for their role in community policing. When an\nofficer is able to create solutions to problems and take risks, he or she ultimately feels accountable for those\nsolutions and assumes a greater responsibility for the well-being of the community. Decentralized decision making\ninvolves flattening the hierarchy of the agency, increasing tolerance for risk taking in problem-solving efforts, and\nallowing officers discretion in handling calls. In addition, providing sufficient authority to coordinate various\nresources to attack a problem and allowing officers the autonomy to establish relationships with the community\nwill help define problems and develop possible solutions. Strategic planning The department should have a written statement reflecting a department-wide commitment to community\npolicing and a plan that matches operational needs to available resources and expertise. If a strategic plan is to\nhave value, the members of the organization should be well-versed in it and be able to give examples of their\nefforts that support the plan. Components such as the organization\u2019s mission and values statement should be\nsimple and communicated widely. Policies\nCommunity policing affects the nature and development of department policies and procedures to ensure that\ncommunity policing principles and practices have an effect on activities on the street. Problem solving and\npartnerships, therefore, should become institutionalized in policies, along with corresponding sets of procedures,\nwhere appropriate. Organizational evaluations In addition to the typical measures of police performance (arrests, response times, tickets issued, and crime rates)\ncommunity policing calls for a broadening of police outcome measures to include such things as greater\ncommunity satisfaction, less fear of crime, the alleviation of problems, and improvement in quality of life. Community policing calls for a more sophisticated approach to evaluation\u2014one that looks at not only how\noutcomes are measured, but also at how feedback information is used. 80 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nTransparency\nCommunity policing involves decision-making processes that are more open than traditional policing. If the\ncommunity is to be a full partner, the department needs mechanisms for readily sharing relevant information on\ncrime and social disorder problems and police operations with the community. Organizational structure It is important that the organizational structure of the agency ensure that local patrol officers have decisionmaking authority and are accountable for their actions.",

This can be achieved through long-term assignments, the\ndevelopment of officers who are generalists, and using special units appropriately. Geographic assignment of officers With community policing, there is a shift to the long-term assignment of officers to specific neighborhoods or\nareas. Geographic deployment plans can help enhance customer service and facilitate more contact between\npolice and the community, thus establishing a strong relationships and mutual accountability. Patrol beat\nboundaries should be aligned to neighborhood boundaries to enhance officers\u2019 understanding of communities\nwithin their patrol areas and to build trust within the community. Other community policing partners should\nbecome familiar with both the patrol officers and community policing officers assigned within each patrol beat to\ncoordinate government and nongovernment community policing activities. Despecialization To achieve community policing goals, officers have to be able to handle multiple responsibilities and take a team\napproach to collaborative problem solving and partnering with the community. Community policing encourages its\nadoption agency-wide, not just by special units, although there may be a need for specialist units that are tasked\nwith identifying and solving particularly complex problems or managing complex partnerships. Resources (time, finances, and people) Agencies have to devote the necessary human and financial resources and the investment of time to support\ncommunity policing to ensure that problem-solving efforts are robust and that partnerships are sustained and\neffective. Personnel The principles of community policing need to be infused throughout the entire personnel system of an agency\nincluding recruitment, hiring, selection, and retention of all law enforcement agency staff, from sworn officers to\ncivilians and volunteers. Personnel evaluations, supervision, and training must also be aligned with the agencies\u2019\ncommunity policing views. Recruitment, hiring, and selection\nAgencies need a systematic means of incorporating community policing elements into their recruitment, selection,\nand hiring processes. Job descriptions should recognize community policing and problem-solving responsibilities\nand encourage the recruitment of officers who have a spirit of service instead of only a spirit of adventure. A 81 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\ncommunity policing agency must also thoughtfully examine where it looks for recruits, whom it is recruiting and\nhiring, and what is being tested. Agencies are also encouraged to seek community involvement in this process\nthrough the identification of competencies and participation in review boards. Personnel supervision/evaluations\nSupervisors must tie performance evaluations to community policing principles and activities that are incorporated\ninto job descriptions. Performance, reward, and promotional procedures should support sound problem-solving\nactivities, proactive policing, community collaboration, and community satisfaction with police services. Training\nTraining at all levels\u2014academy, field, and in-service\u2014must support community policing principles and tactics. It\nalso needs to encourage creative thinking, a proactive orientation, communication and analytical skills, and\ntechniques for dealing with quality-of-life concerns and maintaining order.

Field training officers and supervisors need to learn how to encourage problem solving and help\nofficers learn from other problem-solving initiatives. Until community policing is institutionalized within the\norganization, training in its fundamental principles will need to take place regularly. Information technology systems\nCommunity policing is highly information-intensive, and technology plays a central role in providing ready access to\nquality information. Accurate and timely information makes problem-solving efforts more effective and ensures\nthat officers are informed about the crime and community conditions of their patrol beat. In addition,\ntechnological enhancements can greatly assist with accessing information to provide vital resources, improving\ntwo-way communication with community members, and developing agency accountability systems and\nperformance outcome measures. Communication / access to data Technology provides agencies with an important forum by which to communicate externally with the public and\ninternally within their organization. To communicate with the public, community policing encourages agencies to\ndevelop two-way communication systems through the Internet that allow for online reports; reverse 911; email\nalerts; Internet social media discussion forums; and feedback on interactive applications (such as surveys and\ngeographical information), thereby creating open, ongoing dialogues and increasing transparency. Technology encourages effective internal communication through memoranda, reports, newsletters, email and\nenhanced incident reporting, dispatch functions, and communications interoperability with other entities for more\nefficient operations. Community policing also encourages the use of technology to develop accountability and\nperformance measurement systems that are timely and contain accurate metrics and a broad array of measures\nand information. Community policing encourages the use of technology to provide officers with ready access to timely information\non crime and community characteristics within their beats, either through laptop computers in their patrol cars or\nthrough personal data devices. In addition, technology can support crime/problem analysis functions by enabling\nagencies to gather more detailed information about offenders, victims, crime locations, and quality-of-life\nconcerns, and to further enhance analysis. 82 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nQuality and accuracy of data\nInformation is only as good as its source; therefore, it is not useful if it is of questionable quality and accuracy. Community policing encourages agencies to put safeguards in place to ensure that information from various\nsources is collected in a systematic fashion and entered into central systems that are linked to one another and\nchecked for accuracy so that it can be used effectively for strategic planning, problem solving, and performance\nmeasurement. Problem solving The process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and\nevaluate effective responses. Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion. Rather than\nresponding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions\nto the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused\ninto all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about\ntheir responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses.",

Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about\ntheir responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses. A major conceptual\nvehicle for helping officers to think about problem solving in a structured and disciplined way is the SARA\n(scanning, analysis, response, and assessment) problem-solving model. Scanning: Identifying and prioritizing problems The objectives of scanning are to identify a basic problem, determine the nature of that problem, determine the\nscope of seriousness of the problem, and establish baseline measures. An inclusive list of stakeholders for the\nselected problem is typically identified in this phase. A problem can be thought of as two or more incidents similar\nin one or more ways and that is of concern to the police and the community. Problems can be a type of behavior, a\nplace, a person or persons, a special event or time, or a combination of any of these. The police, with input from\nthe community, should identify and prioritize concerns. Analysis: Researching what is known about the problem\nAnalysis is the heart of the problem-solving process. The objectives of analysis are to develop an understanding of\nthe dynamics of the problem, develop an understanding of the limits of current responses, establish correlation,\nand develop an understanding of cause and effect. As part of the analysis phase, it is important to find out as much\nas possible about each aspect of the crime triangle by asking who?, what?, when?, where?, how?, why?, and why\nnot? about the victim, offender, and crime location. Response: Developing solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number and extent of\nproblems The response phase of the SARA model involves developing and implementing strategies to address an identified\nproblem by searching for strategic responses that are both broad and uninhibited. The response should follow\nlogically from the knowledge learned during the analysis and should be tailored to the specific problem. The goals\nof the response can range from totally eliminating the problem through substantially reducing the problem or\nreducing the amount of harm caused by the problem to improving the quality of community cohesion. 83 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Assessment: Evaluating the success of the responses\nAssessment attempts to determine if the response strategies were successful by understanding if the problem\ndeclined and if the response contributed to the decline. This information not only assists the current effort but also\ngathers data that build knowledge for the future. Strategies and programs can be assessed for process, outcomes,\nor both. If the responses implemented are not effective, the information gathered during analysis should be\nreviewed. New information may have to be collected before new solutions can be developed and tested.

The training goals of the COPS Office are as follows:\n\u0084\u0084Establish a common process for the development of COPS Office training initiatives. \u0084\u0084Manage quality control through a series of review and approval checkpoints. \u0084\u0084Standardize content, style, format, and quality. \u0084\u0084Establish clear outcome expectations of training initiatives. \u0084\u0084Maintain training relevance for the field. \u0084\u0084Prepare training for accreditation through national law enforcement training accreditation programs. The COPS Office defines training as the teaching and learning\nactivities carried out for the primary purpose of helping\nmembers of an organization acquire and apply the knowledge,\nskills, abilities, and attitudes needed by a particular job or organization. Training is driven by specific goals and\nobjectives; it is not a single event but rather an ongoing\nprocess that requires continuous self-reflection and evaluation. Learning outcomes and objectives. Objectives describe\nwhat learners should be able to know and do after training. Learning outcomes establish the criteria by which the training\nwill be judged a success. Training objectives and learning\noutcomes should be aligned with an employee\u2019s position and\nwith the organization\u2019s goals and mission. Self-reflection and evaluation. Self-reflection should be\na conscious process whereby trainees critically analyze the\ntraining materials and test their own understanding and\nretention; it is an internal check on the progress and outcomes\nof the training. Evaluation is the external check; it should\nconsist of setting goals in accordance with the learning outcomes and objectives and conducting pre- and posttraining testing and a final course evaluation to ensure those\ngoals are met. Training materials. Guides, webinars, articles, conference presentations, podcasts, videos, blogs, and newsfeeds (to\nprovide a few examples) can serve as support material in\ntrainings or as stand-alone materials to increase knowledge,\nbut on their own they cannot be defined as training. The COPS Office also has a series of requirements that\ninstructors must meet prior to becoming instructors for\nCOPS Office courses and for the duration of their instructor\ntenure. Those requirements can be found in the COPS\nOffice's Instructor Quality Assurance Guide, https://cops.usdoj. gov/pdf/training/Instructor_Quality_Assurance_Guide.pdf.

March 2018 US Department of Justice\nOffice of Community Oriented Policing Services Fact Sheet www.cops.usdoj.gov The ADDIE Model of\nInstructional Design Fact Sheet The ADDIE model is a process traditionally used\nby instructional designers and training developers. The five phases\u2014Analysis, Design, Development,\nImplementation, and Evaluation\u2014represent a dynamic,\nflexible guideline for building effective training and\nperformance support tools. In the ADDIE model, each step has an outcome that\nfeeds into the subsequent step. Analysis Phase The first stage of the ADDIE model is the analysis\nphase. In this phase, the instructional goals and\nobjectives are established, and the learning environment\nand learner\u2019s existing knowledge and skills are identified. Incorporated in this phase are the needs assessment,\nthe course outline, and the analysis of delivery methods\nmost appropriate to learning.",

During this phase, the\ncurriculum is reviewed and revised according to any\nfeedback given. February 2018 The ADDIE Model of Instructional Design Fact Sheet 2 Implementation Phase Evaluation Phase During the implementation phase, the procedure for\ntraining the facilitators is developed and delivered, and the\nprocedure for training the participants is refined. This is\nalso the phase where the project manager ensures that the\nsupplemental resources (books, hands-on equipment, tools,\nCD-ROMs, and software) are in place and that the learning\napplication or website is functional, available, and ready for\nuse. In this stage, the course is also tested and deployed to\ndetermine whether the components function as designed\nwithin the identified environment. This phase validates the\nimplementation and identifies any anomalies prior to full\ncourse deployment. The evaluation phase determines how students feel about\nthe course experience, whether goals were achieved, whether\nthe transfer of learning took place, and any long-term\noutcomes. This phase also identifies the gaps in student\nperformance that need to be addressed. Two levels of\nevaluation may be conducted:\nLevel 1\u2014Reactions. Learners provide reactions and comments to the course, usually in the form of a response to\na questionnaire. Level 2\u2014Learning.

Approximately how long should it take to adequately complete the Conference & Events Submission\nform? The amount of time required to adequately complete the Conference & Events Submission Form will vary\ndepending on the complexity of the proposed event. A small event (in terms of number of attendees,\ntotal cost, etc.) may require only an hour or two to complete the form because the event is basic/routine\nand data are not required in all of the available categories.",

On the other hand, a large event (in terms of\nnumber of attendees, multiple sessions occurring at the same time, etc.) may require several hours or\ndays depending on the amount of required data (categories) and level of justi\ufb01cation needed to support\nthe event. Regardless of the size of any event, the supporting justi\ufb01cation should be su\ufb03cient to support\nthe agency\u2019s mission for conducting the event. II. Which types of events do not require prior approval? Currently there are six types of events that do not require prior approval:\ni.\nii.\niii. iv. v.\nvi. Conferences held by grant recipients. (Note: Conferences held by cooperative agreement recipients\ndo require prior approval.) Law enforcement operational activities, including staging, surveillance, investigation, intelligence, and\nundercover activities. Routine operational meetings (e.g., sta\ufb00 meetings or all-hands meetings) if held in a federal facility, if\nheld by cooperative agreement recipients in a non-federal facility that does not charge for its use,\nand if there are neither costs to the DOJ for logistical conference planning nor government-provided\nfood or beverages. In all three of these instances, the answer to all the questions on the Prior\nApproval Not Required Checklist must be \u201cNo.\u201d Site visits are considered routine operational\nmeetings regardless of location so long as there are no costs to the DOJ for meeting rooms, logistical\nconference planning, or food and beverages. Testing activities where the primary purpose of the event is to evaluate an applicant\u2019s quali\ufb01cations\nto perform certain duties necessary to his or her job. This includes \ufb01rearms and weaponry pro\ufb01ciency\ntesting and certi\ufb01cations. A majority of the event must be devoted to administering and taking the\ntest. Testing activities that are incidental to a training course or conference or are given upon its\ncompletion do require prior approval. Video conferences and webinars where there are neither costs to the DOJ for logistical conference\nplanning nor government-provided food or beverages. Technical assistance visits where travel was made by an individual or a small group of project sta\ufb00\nmembers to provide training or technical assistance to a particular entity; in this instance, the answer\nto all the questions on the Prior Approval Not Required Checklist must be \u201cNo.\u201d 89 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nIII. Where should time staff spent working on the conference that is not related to planning be captured? Time spent working on a conference by sta\ufb00 or contractors can be classi\ufb01ed as either logistical planning\ntime or programmatic planning time. Programmatic planning includes time spent on activities such as\ndeveloping the conference content and agenda, identifying and recruiting subject matter experts, and\npreparing written materials. Logistical planning includes time spent on tasks such as selecting a venue,\nordering and setting up audio-video equipment, securing hotel rooms, processing registrations, providing\nonsite support during the event, and undertaking other non-programmatic functions.

IV. If a cooperative agreement recipient or contractor is able to obtain a no-cost site for the event, are we\nstill required to look into other facilities and provide justi\ufb01cation for not selecting the other facilities? Yes. Cooperative agreement recipients and contractors should compare three or more facilities in a\nlocation. Facilities being compared should have provided a cost estimate and be able to accommodate the\nevent as detailed in the requirements. A desired hotel may o\ufb00er an incentive of no overall facility cost\n(e.g., for meeting rooms or audio-visual equipment) but may not be economical in other cost comparison\nitems such as the availability of lodging at per diem rates, travel distance for attendees, etc. Also,\nrecipients and contractors should maintain written documentation justifying their decision to select the\nchosen location in the event of a future audit. V. Is there a timeframe after the COPS O\ufb03ce accepts a conference request that a cooperative agreement\nrecipient or contractor can expect noti\ufb01cation of approval? Each event request (meeting, conference, webinar, etc.) is unique in reference to how it will accomplish\nthe COPS O\ufb03ce\u2019s mission. The key to any conference request moving through the review process depends\non whether the package is complete. A complete package contains a detailed cost analysis and su\ufb03cient\njusti\ufb01cation to support all categories within the package. Example: An event is submitted for approval and consists of the following categories: printing and\ndistribution, meals and incidental expenses (M&IE), lodging, transportation, and trainer or facilitator\ncosts. The package contains a detailed cost analysis of each cost category (e.g., one trainer at $450 per\nday x 2 days = $900) and adequate justi\ufb01cation explaining the purpose of the event and the role of the\ntrainer. This package can move through the review process in a few days and allow ample time for\ntravelers to make reservations, if the package was submitted within the required timeframe. However, if\nthe trainer or facilitator\u2019s costs in the submitted package exceed the COPS O\ufb03ce\u2019s threshold and if\nsupporting justi\ufb01cation was not included, a delay may occur while this justi\ufb01cation is being retrieved. To avoid delays in the approval process, all recipients and contractors should adhere to the timeframe\nrequirements for the dollar amount of their proposed event. VI. Once an event is approved, how do we handle any increases or decreases in the amount of attendees\noriginally proposed on the cost analysis spreadsheet submitted to the DOJ for approval? After receiving noti\ufb01cation of approval from the COPS Office, all subsequent changes prior to the start day\nof the event should be sent to the COPS O\ufb03ce Conference Costs email address, as appropriate. Example: If the COPS Office approved on 9/1/2017 an event scheduled for 12/15/2017, the cooperative agreement\nrecipient or contractor should notify the COPS Office of any changes in attendees as soon as possible\n(preferably 30 days or more in advance).",

This scenario holds true for changes to the start and end date,\nlocation, and any other cost-related category. 90 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nVII. Does the $25 per person per day limit for meeting rooms and audio-visual costs also include service fees\nand taxes? Yes. The cost allowed for conference space and audio-visual equipment and services (fees and taxes) is\nlimited to $25 per day per attendee and is not to exceed a cumulative total cost of $20,000. Total costs\nare de\ufb01ned as direct and indirect costs. VIII. What if there are multiple meetings occurring within the larger event o\ufb00ered to all the attendees? Is\nthe $25 per day per attendee limit applicable to each meeting? Example: A general session meeting\ncontains all attendees and later breakout sessions are o\ufb00ered to the groups. Can each breakout session\nhave its own $25 per person per day limit? No. Despite the multiple meetings o\ufb00ered within the larger event, the COPS Office considers and\napproves this type of situation to be a single event. IX. Can we accept complimentary food and beverage? Yes. Complimentary food and beverages may be accepted if o\ufb00ered to everyone. Example: Hotel W o\ufb00ers\na complimentary continental breakfast to all its overnight customers regardless of any status they may\nhave with the hotel chain. This type of complimentary o\ufb00er is considered a business strategy of the hotel\nto promote an increase in overnight stays. You are not required to reduce your M&IE by the value of the\nfood and beverage it o\ufb00ered to all customers as noted in this example. X. Are the thresholds ($8,750 for logistical planner, $35,000 for programmatic planner, and $20,000 for\nconference space and audio-visual equipment and services) a cumulative cost for the entire event or a\nper day cost? The cost allowed for conference space and audio-visual equipment and services (fees and taxes) is limited\nto $25 per day per attendee and is not to exceed a cumulative total cost of $20,000. The cost allowed for\na logistical planner is the lesser of $50 per attendee or $8,750 per event. The cost allowed for a\nprogrammatic planner is the lesser of $200 per attendee or $35,000 per event. XI. To whom should I submit event requests? For all COPS O\ufb03ce events, the form should be sent to the COPS Office Conference Costs email address.

Requests for conferences costing $100,000 or less, and not exceeding any cost thresholds (conference\nspace and audio-visual equipment and services, logistical conference planner, and programmatic\nconference planner), must be submitted to the COPS Office 90 calendar days in advance of the earliest of\nthe following:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Start date of the conference;\nDeadline for signing conference-related contracts; or\nObligation of funds for conference costs (except for minimal costs required to assemble and\nsubmit the approval request). 91 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual\nRequests for conferences costing more than $100,000, or exceeding any one cost threshold (conference\nspace and audio-visual equipment and services, logistical conference planner, or programmatic\nconference planner), must be submitted to the COPS Office 120 calendar days in advance of the earliest of\nthe following:\nStart date of the conference;\nDeadline for signing conference-related contracts; or\nObligation of funds for conference costs (except for minimal costs required to assemble and\nsubmit the approval request). If approval requests are submitted less than the required number of days in advance (as noted above),\nthe COPS O\ufb03ce, in its sole discretion, may consider the late requests but cannot ensure the requests will\nreceive a decision in time to avoid having to cancel the conference (particularly if any issues arise with\nspeci\ufb01c items of cost in the request). Cancellation costs associated with conference requests that are\nsubmitted for late prior approval may be determined to be unallowable costs by the COPS Office. \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 XIII. What are the most common mistakes made on the forms so that I can avoid them in the future and\nincrease the likelihood of a quick review and approval decision for my event? The following are the most common mistakes found:\n\u2022 Inaccurate calculation of daily per diem. Daily per diem rates for locations across the nation\ncan be found on the GSA website. Ensure the daily rate used in the calculations corresponds\nto the speci\ufb01c location and dates of the meeting. In addition, remember that travel days are\nreimbursed at a slightly lower rate than meeting days. The lower rates must be used for days\nof travel both before and after the event. Table 3 includes these lower rates: Table 3. Per diem rates Full per diem rate Corresponding travel day rate (75%) $46.00 $34.50 $51.00 $38.25 $56.00 $42.00 $61.00 $45.75 $66.00 $49.50 $71.00 $53.25 EXCEPTION: If your organization has its own formal, written travel policy, your event submissions can re\ufb02ect that policy instead\nof the rates in the chart above.

In cases where higher rates are included in the\nevent submission, written documentation of prior approval is required and should be\nattached. Should I continue to exclude all food and beverage costs in my event submissions? Yes. The inclusion of food and beverage costs will delay the review process, and these costs are not likely\nto be approved. The only exception is when the location of the conference does not allow attendees to\nobtain food or beverages on their own or when this restriction would greatly disrupt the conference\nschedule. If you believe your event quali\ufb01es for such a rare exception, contact your Program Manager to\ndiscuss it before completing and submitting your form. If meals are included in your event submission,\nremember that attendees must subtract the meal costs from the M&IE reimbursement for the days on\nwhich the meals will occur. XV.

Every e\ufb00ort is made to review all events as quickly as possible. Most delays result from a need for additional information. Event requests are prioritized for review by\nbalancing the following three criteria:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 The start date of the event; The date the event submission was received by COPS O\ufb03ce; and\nThe overall cost and complexity of the event. For example, conferences requiring approval\nby the assistant attorney general\u2019s administration and the deputy attorney general (over\n$100,000\u2013$250,000) typically take longer to process, as they must go through COPS O\ufb03ce\nand DOJ reviews, result in more questions, and are more likely to have issues related to cost\nthresholds. 93 2018 COPS Office Community Policing Development (CPD) Program Award Owner\u2019s Manual Reporting\nXVII.

XVIII. If I have a question about conference reporting, to whom should I send it? Send your questions to your designated Program Manager. They are great resources and will be happy to\nassist you. XIX. Are we expected to have our sta\ufb00 track their time hour for hour for time spent on the event for\nplanning, etc., or are reasonable estimates adequate for cost reporting purposes? Post-event reports must contain actual costs, not estimates. These costs should include logistical and\nprogrammatic planner sta\ufb00 time spent on these activities and any contracted planner costs.

Program income means gross income earned by the recip\u00ad\nient or subrecipient that is directly generated by an awardsupported activity or earned as a result of a federal award\nduring the award period. 1 Program income includes income\nfrom fees for services performed, the use or rental of real or\npersonal property acquired under federal awards, the sale of\ncommodities or items fabricated under a federal award, license\nfees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal\nand interest on loans made with federal award funds. from your COPS Office award constitutes program income. They will help you assess whether or not the income is\ngenerated as a result of the award-supported activity. Program income means gross income earned by the\nrecipient or subrecipient that is directly generated by\nan award-supported activity or earned as a result of a\nfederal award during the award period. How can program income be used? Examples of program income that has been generated from\nsome COPS Office\u2013funded activities include fees collected\nfor conference registration, exhibit booths, and website\nadvertisements. Interest earned on advances of federal funds\nis not program income. Except as otherwise provided for\nin federal statutes, regulations, or the award terms and\nconditions, program income does not include rebates,\ncredits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them. Program income must be used in accordance with the\nstandards set forth in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.307.

Although recipients are encouraged to earn program income\nto defray program costs where appropriate, most COPS\nOffice awards are not conducive to generating program\nincome. Contact your COPS Office program manager or\ngrant program specialist to determine if revenue generated 1. Program income is defined by 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.80 in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost\nPrinciples, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards as adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice in\n2 C.F.R. \u00a7 2800.101 for awards made after December 26, 2014. Prior awards would follow 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\n66.25 and 70.24. 2. See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.400(g). 1. deducted from total allowable project costs to determine\nnet allowable costs to reduce the federal award; 2. added to the federal award to increase funds committed\nto the project; 3. used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement\nof the federal award. Unless otherwise specified in the award terms and conditions\nor approved by the COPS Office, program income will be\nused to defray program costs and reduce the federal share\nof the project. Program income not anticipated at the time\nof the award must be used to reduce the federal award\nand recipient contributions rather than to increase funds\ncommitted to the project. For example, if you were awarded\n$100,000 in COPS Office funding with no local match\nrequirement to support a conference and earned $5,000 in\nprogram income from registration fees generated from that\nconference, an excess of $5,000 would remain in award\nfunds at the completion of the project. The $5,000 would\nbe returned to the Federal Government, thereby reducing\nthe federal share of the project. Program Income 2 In some cases, with prior approval, recipients may be able to\nwork with their COPS Office program manager to identify\nadditional project-related allowable costs that could be\nsupported with program income. Earned program income can be spent only on allowable\nproject costs incurred during the award period. Program\nincome cannot be commingled with other awards and cannot\nbe used for purposes outside of the scope of the award that\ngenerated the income. There are a variety of circumstances that can affect how\nprogram income is treated. If you anticipate generating\nprogram income, please contact your COPS Office program\nmanager, grant program specialist, or designated financial\nanalyst for guidance. How should recipients report\nprogram income? You are required to report gross program income earned\nand expended on the Federal Financial Report (SF-425)3\nsubmitted each quarter. How you complete the report\ndepends on when you earn and spend the program income\nand the status of your award. Using the example above\nwhere you earned $5,000 from registration fees, you would enter the total amount of program income earned ($5,000)\non 10.l and the total amount of program income expended\non line 10.m. 4 Program income earned and expended must be reported on\na cumulative basis. You must manually enter these\ncumulative amounts each quarter, as the SF-425 form does\nnot automatically calculate these amounts.",

Program Income Can recipients keep program income as a cash\nreserve for future project costs? No. Recipients should expend earned program income before\ndrawing down award funds. 5 How much time is available to spend\nprogram income? Allowable project expenses can be supported by earned\nprogram income during the open award period. Funds\ncannot be drawn down for expenses that are incurred after\nthe award end date. Avoid retaining earned program income for extended periods\nof time. If you anticipate a significant lapse of time occurring\nbetween earning and spending program income, contact your\nCOPS Office program manager or grant program specialist.

Indirect Facilities & Administrative (F&A) costs are costs\nincurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more\nthan one cost objective. They are not readily attributable to\nthe cost objectives that are being benefited. To facilitate equi\u00ad\ntable distribution of indirect expenses to the specific\ncost objectives, it may be necessary to establish a number\nof pools of indirect (F&A) costs. Indirect (F&A) cost pools\nmust be distributed to benefited cost objectives on bases\nthat will produce equitable results in consideration of relative\nbenefits derived. 1 1 See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.56 in the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost\nPrinciples, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, as adopted by the US\nDepartment of Justice in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 2800.101. Indirect (facilities & administrative (F&A)) costs are costs\nincurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than\none cost objective. They are not readily attributable to the\ncost objectives that are being benefited. There are several types of indirect cost rates:\n\u0084\u0084Final rate is applicable to a specified past period that is based on the actual costs of the period. A final audited rate\nis not subject to adjustment. \u0084\u0084Fixed rate has the same characteristics as a predetermined rate except that the difference between estimated costs\nand actual allowable costs of the covered period is carried\nforward as an adjustment for a future period. \u0084\u0084 One-time extension allows your agency to apply for a one-time extension of a negotiated indirect (F&A) cost\nrate. The negotiated cost rate may be extended for up\nto four years. Once your cognizant federal agency has\napproved an extension for indirect costs, you must abide\nby the rate for the agreed-upon time period. No further\nnegotiations regarding indirect cost rates may occur until\nthe extension has expired. At the end of the extension\nperiod, you must negotiate a new indirect cost rate. Indirect Cost Rate for FY 2018 Awards \u0084\u0084Predetermined rate is applicable to a specified current or future period and is not subject to adjustment. A predeter\u00ad\nmined rate may be used where there is reasonable assur\u00ad\nance that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on\nthe agency\u2019s actual costs.

The cognizant federal agency for indirect cost is\nnot necessarily the same as the cognizant federal agency for\naudit. The COPS Office is not a cognizant federal agency. For nonprofit, state, local, and tribal governments your\ncognizant federal agency is generally the federal agency that\nprovides your organization with the most federal financial\nassistance. For assignments of cognizant federal agencies, see\nthe following:\n1. For institutions of higher education: Appendix III to Part 200\u2014Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assign\u00ad\nment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher\nEducation (IHEs), paragraph C.11. 2. For nonprofit organizations: Appendix IV to Part 200\u2014 Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and\nRate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations, para\u00ad\ngraph C.2.a. 3. For state and local governments: Appendix V to Part 200\u2014State/Local Government and Indian Tribe-Wide\nCentral Service Cost Allocation Plans, paragraph F.1.\n4.

What should an agency do if its indirect\ncost rate expires or changes during the\naward period? If your agency\u2019s approved indirect cost rate agreement expires\nduring the award period, a current approved rate agreement\nmust be obtained from the cognizant federal agency and\nsubmitted to the COPS Office.

The COPS Office realizes that agencies\nmay need to reprogram award funds and has provided this\nfact sheet for CPD recipients to assist with the process. Recipients may reprogram up to a total of 10 percent of\ntheir total approved budget (over the course of the award)\nwithout submitting a formal budget modification. However,\nrecipients should notify their COPS Office program man\u00ad\nager (PM) prior to any reprogramming of funds regardless\nof whether a formal budget modification is needed. Once\nthe reprogramming of funds exceeds 10 percent of the total\napproved budget, your agency must submit a formal budget\nmodification requesting approval from the COPS Office\nfor any additional budget modification requests. Effective\nJune 20, 2018, any awards under $250,000 do not require\nformal budget modifications; however, the recipient should\ncommunicate reprogramming as needed with the COPS\nOffice PM. Reprogrammed funds must be allocated for items covered\nwithin the scope of the original award. Any funds that are\nbeing requested to account for a change in scope from the\noriginal funded project must first receive approval from the\nCOPS Office to expand or change the scope. Be advised that\nreprogramming requests for unallowable costs will not be\napproved. The COPS Office will not approve any modifica\u00ad\ntion request that results in an increase of federal funds. Starting with 2017 funding, if a budget modification\ninvolves making a new subaward to a State or local govern\u00ad\nment entity, the recipient and its intended subrecepient are\nrequired to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373 regard\u00ad\ning prohibitions or restrictions on sending to, requesting or\nreceiving from, maintaining, or exchanging information on\ncitizenship or immigration status, including any prohibi\u00ad\ntions or restrictions imposed or established by a State or\nlocal government entity or official. For information about\nthe applicable form and how to certify, please contact your\nCOPS Office PM. What to do if you need\na budget modification If your budget requires a modification, please follow\nthese steps:\n1.
