This document is intended to serve as a guide to full implementation of SORNA, and to provide information\nthat each tribe should consider as it determines how to substantially implement SORNA. Tribes should\nuse this Revised Model Tribal Sex Offender Registry Code/Ordinance only as a starting point. SORNA\nimplementation is unique to each jurisdiction and adoption of a sex offender code should reflect the unique\nlaws, processes, population, land, and traditions of each tribe. This document also includes drafting tips intended to encourage tribal leaders to consider other relevant\nissues as they meet to discuss any potential code/ordinance development. Further, submission of a code\nto the SMART Office is only part of the necessary submission for substantial implementation review. Please\ncontact the SMART Office for additional materials to assist with your work toward implementation of\nSORNA.
