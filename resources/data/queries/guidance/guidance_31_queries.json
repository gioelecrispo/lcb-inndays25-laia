Claims submitted to the wrong location will be\ntransferred to the appropriate Bureau Office. P5580.09 3/20/2018 2 f. Claims Should Be Tracked. Regional Counsel staff will track all claims that are filed\nproperly within their regions. Claims will not be closed until they are settled, denied, rejected, or\ntransferred to another agency. 4. PROCESSING A SMALL CLAIM\na. Acknowledgment Letter. If the claimant has provided all necessary information to process\nthe claim (such as time, date, place where the incident occurred, and a specific damages request),\nstaff should send an acknowledgment letter to the claimant indicating the filing date and a claim\nnumber. Staff should also notify the claimant of his/her responsibility to inform the agency of\nany changes in address. Staff should reject claims that are unclear, illegible, fail to specify a sum\ncertain or fail to provide a signature. Regional Counsel and Office of General Counsel staff will date-stamp all claims on the date they\nare received, whether the claims are received in the proper office or not. A claim that is\ntransferred to another Bureau office is considered filed on the date when the claim was received by\nthe transferring office. The office responsible for the claim will then notify the claimant that the\nclaim was transferred. b. Investigation. The Regional Office will refer the claim to the appropriate institution or office\nfor investigation. The claimant or representative can be required to provide additional\ninformation during the investigation. Failure to respond within 60 days may result in the rejection\nor denial of the claim. Claims filed by inmates in the Witness Security Program (WITSEC) must\nbe handled in the same manner as other claims, except that all correspondence and the resulting\ninvestigation must be sent through the Inmate Monitoring Branch, Correctional Programs\nDivision. c. Final Decision on Each Claim. The Regional Counsel, or designee, will review the\ninvestigation and the supporting evidence, and render a decision on all claims properly filed in the\nRegional Office. After considering the merits of the claim, the Regional Counsel may deny or\npropose a settlement of the claim. The settlement limit for claims filed under 31 U.S.C.\u00a7 3723 is\n$1,000. d. Inmate Property Claims Filed under the FTCA Should Be Denied. If an inmate property\nclaim is incorrectly filed under the FTCA instead of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3723, staff should deny the FTCA\nclaim. However, staff can consider the claim under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3723 without the claimant filing\nanother claim. P5580.09 3/20/2018 3 e. Depreciation Must Be Considered. Staff must consider depreciation of lost or damaged\nproperty when settling a claim. The Bureau of Prisons Depreciation Guide is available on\nSallyport. f. Requests for Reconsideration.
