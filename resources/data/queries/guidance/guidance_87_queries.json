When your child enrolls, you should receive a home language survey or similar form to fill out\nthat helps the school identify potential English learners, who are eligible for language\nassistance services. If your child is identified as an English learner, the school must notify you\nin writing within 30 days of the school year starting with information about your child\u2019s\nEnglish language proficiency level, programs and services available to meet your child\u2019s\neducational needs, and your right to opt your child out of a program or particular services for\nEnglish learners.

      "content": "\uf0b7 A school district may, for example, use a home language survey, to inquire whether a\nparent requires oral and/or written communication in a language other than English.\n\uf0b7 The school\u2019s initial inquiry should, of course, be translated into languages that are\ncommon in the school and surrounding community so that that the inquiry is designed\nto reach parents in a language they are likely to understand. What steps must school districts take to provide effective language assistance to LEP\nparents? \uf0b7 School districts must provide effective language assistance to limited English proficient\nparents, such as by offering translated materials or a language interpreter. Language\nassistance must be free and provided by appropriate and competent staff, or through\nappropriate and competent outside resources. \uf0b7 School districts should ensure that interpreters and translators have knowledge in both\nlanguages of any specialized terms or concepts to be used in the communication at\nissue, and are trained on the role of an interpreter and translator, the ethics of\ninterpreting and translating, and the need to maintain confidentiality. \uf0b7 It is not sufficient for the staff merely to be bilingual. For example, a staff member who\nis bilingual may be able to communicate directly with limited English proficient parents\nin a different language, but may not be competent to interpret in and out of that\nlanguage, or to translate documents. What can I do if I have questions, want additional information, or believe a school is not\ncomplying with these requirements?\n\uf0b7 You may visit the website of the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights\n(OCR) at www.ed.gov/ocr or contact OCR at (800) 421-3481 (TDD: 800-877-8339) or at\nocr@ed.gov.
