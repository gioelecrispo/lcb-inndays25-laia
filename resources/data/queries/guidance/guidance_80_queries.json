Samuels, Jr.\nDirector, Federal Bureau of Prisons\n1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n\u00a7522.30 Purpose and scope. When the court orders or recommends an unescorted commitment to a Bureau of\nPrisons institution, the Bureau of Prisons authorizes the commitment and\ndesignates the institution for service of sentence. The Bureau of Prisons also\nauthorizes furlough transfers of inmates between Bureau of Prisons institutions\nor to nonfederal institutions in appropriate circumstances in accordance with 18\nU.S.C. 3622 or 4082, and within the guidelines of the Bureau of Prisons policy on\nfurloughs, which allows inmates to travel unescorted and to report voluntarily to\nan assigned institution. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4082 applies to inmates whose offense(s) occurred before November 1, 1987. For inmates whose offense(s) occurred on or after November 1, 1987, the statutory authority for\nfurloughs is Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3622, which was added by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act\n(CCCA). In this Program Statement, unescorted commitments are referred to as \u201cvoluntary surrenders.\u201d Federal Regulations from 28 CFR are shown in this type. Implementing instructions are shown in this type. For identification purposes, the Bureau and the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) use the\nAuthorized Unescorted Commitments and Transfers (BP-A0385). Instructions for completing\nthis form are in Section 4.\na. Summary of Changes\nPolicy Rescinded\nP5140.37\nUnescorted Transfers and Voluntary Surrenders (1/31/03)\n\u25a0 Eliminates the requirement for unescorted transfer packets to be forwarded via certified mail. \u25a0 Eliminates the preparation of the Authorized Unescorted Commitments and Transfers card\nfor inmates transferring between Bureau institutions. b. Program Objectives. Expected results of this program are:\n\u25a0 Inmates will be moved between institutions expeditiously and cost-effectively, with regard\nfor public safety. \u25a0 Staff will have appropriate procedures when an inmate fails to report to a Federal institution,\ncontact facility, or Residential Reentry Center (RRC) as an unescorted transfer or voluntary\nsurrender. c. Institution Supplement. None required. Should local facilities make any changes outside\nthe required changes in the national policy or establish any additional local procedures to\nimplement the national policy, the local Union may invoke to negotiate procedures or\nappropriate arrangements. 2. PROCESSING PROCEDURES\na. Voluntary Surrenders. When a court orders or recommends a voluntary surrender\ncommitment, U.S. Courts, U.S. Probation, and USMS electronically transfer sentencing\ndocuments and information to the Designation and Sentence Computation Center (DSCC), which\nenters the designation. Once designated, Correctional Systems staff access designation material through the e-Designate\nwebsite and forward it to appropriate staff. Correctional Systems staff execute the Judgment in a Criminal Case (J&C) upon receiving the\ninmate. The original executed J&C is returned to the USMS per 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(c). P5140.43 4/21/2015 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 2 If an inmate surrenders to a facility which is not the designated institution, the DSCC is\ncontacted to obtain commitment documentation. Correctional Systems staff identify the inmate\nwith this documentation, assume custody, and coordinate movement to the designated institution. If factors are present which would preclude staff from assuming custody, the Regional\nCorrectional Programs Administrator should be contacted for guidance. b.
