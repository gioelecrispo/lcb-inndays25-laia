If the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator\n(DAPC) determines the inmate is qualified for participation in the RDAP, he or she will review\nSENTRY to determine if the inmate:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 has received a prior early release under \u00a7 3621(e);\nis a contract boarder (e.g., a state or military inmate);\nis a pretrial offender;\nhas a detainer that will prohibit completion of the community treatment component of the\nRDAP;\n\u2022 committed his/her federal offense before November 1, 1987; or\n\u2022 committed his/her D.C. offense before August 5, 2000. If the DAPC determines the inmate meets any of the above conditions, the inmate is NOT\nELIGIBLE for a \u00a7 3621(e) early release and no further review is required. The DAPC will then\nmeet with the inmate to notify him or her of his or her ineligibility for an early release. The\nDAPC will also:\n\u2022 have the inmate sign the Notice of RDAP Qualification form (BP-A0941). \u2022 forward the Notice of RDAP Qualification form to the Unit Team for placement in the\ninmate\u2019s Central File; and\n\u2022 enter the appropriate early release eligibility assignment into SENTRY. Note: The DAPC can notify the inmate of his/her early release ineligibility and have the inmate\nsign the Notice of RDAP Qualification form at the same time. If the inmate is not excluded from eligibility upon the DAPC\u2019s initial review, the inmate will\nrequire a \u00a7 3621(e) offense review by the DSCC legal staff. The DAPC or designee will submit\n(via GroupWise) a Request for \u00a7 3621(e) Offense Review form in a timely manner. The DAPC or designee will also forward an electronic copy of the Judgment and Commitment\nOrder (J&C) and the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) if the DSCC does not already have\nP5331.02 3/16/2009 Federal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type. Page 5 one. To determine whether the DSCC has a copy of an inmate\u2019s J&C file (which includes the\nPSR), the DAPC or designee will check the sentence computation data function in SENTRY. If\nthe \u201cDSC\u201d last updated the computation, the DSCC has a copy of the J&C file, and there is no\nneed to send a copy of the same with the Request for \u00a7 3621(e) Offense Review form. However,\nif an institution last updated the computation, the DSCC does not have a copy of the J&C file. In\nthose cases, the DAPC or designee will send a scanned copy of the J&C file with the Request for\n\u00a7 3621(e) Offense Review form. The DAPC will place the inmate\u2019s name and register number in\nthe subject line of the email to DSCC legal staff. b. Designation and Sentence Computation Center, Offense Review. Upon receipt of the\nRequest for \u00a7 3621(e) Offense Review form and the J&C file, the DSCC legal staff will ordinarily\nhave 30 working days to determine an inmate\u2019s early release eligibility status based on a review\nof the inmate\u2019s current offense and prior convictions. The DSCC legal staff will review current\nand prior offenses for both U.S. Code and D.C. Code felony offenders.

ASSIGNMENT OF \u00a7 3621(e) EARLY RELEASE CONDITIONAL DATE\na. Drug Abuse Program Coordinator. Upon a qualified inmate\u2019s entry into the RDAP, the\nDAPC, or designee, will:\n\u2022 enter into SENTRY the appropriate participation assignment; and\n\u2022 within 15 working days, forward a Notice of \u00a7 3621(e) Date form (BP-A0764) to the DSCC\nteam responsible for the inmate\u2019s sentence computation requesting computation of a\n\u00a7 3621(e) conditional release method date, with a copy to the unit team and the Correctional\nSystems Department (CSD). P5331.02 3/16/2009 Federal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type. Page 6 b. DSCC Staff. Within 15 working days of the DSCC staff receiving the\nNotice of \u00a7 3621(e) Date form, computation staff will enter the estimated completion date into\nthe \u00a7 3621(e) CRPS MN field (Complete Residential Program), and recalculate the sentence. The corresponding satisfaction/release method will be \u00a7 3621(e) COND (\u00a7 3621E Conditional). 10. LENGTH OF SENTENCE Following completion of Transitional Drug Abuse Treatment (TDAT), inmates found to be\neligible for an early release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e) may receive that early release based upon\nthe length of their sentence, as detailed in the table below. Sentence Length Early Release Time-Frame 30 MONTHS or LESS No more than 6 months 31-36 MONTHS No more than 9 months 37 MONTHS OR MORE No more than 12 months The early release time-frame reductions shown on the table are not pro-rated by days. For\nexample, if an inmate\u2019s sentence is 36 months and any number of days, 9 months is the\nmaximum sentence reduction allowed, whether the inmate\u2019s sentence is 36 months and 0 days, or\n36 months and 30 days. Any change in current offense sentence length as imposed by order of the Court will result in a\nrecalculation of sentence computation and provisional incentive. For example, a 36-month\nsentence reduced to a 24-month sentence will result in no more than a 6-month early release. 11. MONITORING OF EARLY RELEASE ELIGIBILITY STATUS",

MONITORING OF EARLY RELEASE ELIGIBILITY STATUS An inmate may require changes to, or lose, his or her early release eligibility at any time as a\nresult of:\n\u2022 information that renders the inmate ineligible, see section 5; or\n\u2022 identification of a previous error. Chapter 2 of the Program Statement Psychology Treatment Programs contains specific\ninformation on the circumstances that may lead to expulsion and loss of early release. DAP staff,\ndesignated DSCC staff, Unit Team staff, TDAT staff, and Community Corrections staff play key\nroles in identifying, monitoring and documenting an inmate\u2019s eligibility for early release. This\nprocess involves the steps described below. P5331.02 3/16/2009 Federal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type. Page 7 a. The DAPC. The DAPC, or designee, in all Bureau institutions will review all eligible inmate\nDRG assignments bi-monthly and prior to the inmate receiving a DAP COMP or FOL COMP\nSENTRY assignment. (1) Completion of the Unit-Based RDAP Component. If the inmate completes the unit-based\ncomponent (see Psychology Treatment Programs) of the RDAP, the local DAPC, or designee,\nwill:\n\u2022 replace the SENTRY participation assignment to completion assignment; and\n\u2022 add a SENTRY assignment for follow-up treatment indicating the inmate is enrolled in\ninstitutional transitional aftercare. (2) Additional Completion Time in RDAP. If an eligible inmate is determined, for clinical\nreasons (e.g., difficulty meeting treatment goals) or administrative reasons (e.g., writ, medical,\ninstitutional need), to require additional time to complete the RDAP, the DAPC, or designee, will\nimmediately forward the Notice of \u00a7 3621(e) Date form to the CSD, Unit Team, and the DSCC. (3) Change in Early Release Status, Ineligible to Eligible. If the DAPC is notified by the Unit\nTeam of a change in circumstance of an \u201cineligible\u201d inmate (e.g., detainer dropped, court case\nresolved, etc.), the DAPC, or designee, will:\n\u2022 review the inmate\u2019s case to determine if there are any other exclusionary criteria that would\nmaintain the inmate\u2019s ineligibility for early release;\n\u2022 immediately replace the SENTRY DRG assignment of INELIGIBLE to ELIGIBLE, if no\nother exclusionary criteria exist; and\n\u2022 forward a Notice of \u00a73621(e) Date form to the CSD, the Unit Team, and the DSCC\nrequesting appropriate change to the \u00a7 3621(e) conditional release method date. (4) RDAP Expel/Fail/Withdraw. If an early release eligible inmate is expelled or withdraws\nfrom the RDAP (e.g., significant failure to meet treatment goals, significant program disruption,\nreceives an incident report for misconduct related to drugs, alcohol, and/or act(s) of violence), the\nDAPC or designee will:\n\u2022 complete Section III of the Change in RDAP and \u00a7 3621(e) Status form (BP-A0767);\n\u2022 notify the inmate and send the Change in RDAP and \u00a7 3621(e) Status form electronically to\nthe CSD, the Unit Team and the DSCC team responsible for the inmate\u2019s sentence\ncomputation;\n\u2022 replace the SENTRY assignment of participation with program failure for expulsion or\nfailure, as appropriate; and\n\u2022 when appropriate, replace the SENTRY assignments from \u00a7 3621(e) eligible to ineligible.",

Ordinarily, this will occur 30 days before the inmate\u2019s RRC transfer. This form ensures that all\ncriteria for early release have been met. In conjunction with this review the DAPC, or designee,\nis to review SENTRY to determine if:\n\u2022 the inmate has completed all components of the unit-based RDAP, in a unit set apart from the\ngeneral population for no less than nine months; and\n\u2022 the inmate has completed the follow-up component of the RDAP. b. The Unit Team. Typically, the Unit Team\u2019s review of the inmate\u2019s status will be in\nconjunction with regularly scheduled program reviews, preparation of release paperwork, and\nRRC referrals. (1) Change in Early Release Eligibility Status/DAP WAIT QUAL or DAP PART. If an\neligible inmate\u2019s early release eligibility status requires change (e.g., detainers removed/added,\nnoncompliance with FRP), the Unit Team will immediately notify the DAPC via e-mail. (2) Change in Early Release Eligibility Status/RDAP Complete. If an eligible inmate has\ncompleted all institution components of RDAP (i.e., the unit-based program and the follow-up\ntreatment program) and is later determined to require a change in his/her early release status (e.g.,\ndetainers removed/added, found guilty by the DHO for misconduct related to drugs, alcohol,\nand/or act(s) of violence, noncompliance with FRP), the Unit Team will immediately notify the\nDAPC via e-mail. The DAPC will:\n\u2022 complete the Change in RDAP and \u00a7 3621(e) Status form;\n\u2022 provide a copy of the Change in RDAP and \u00a7 3621(e) Status form to the inmate; and\n\u2022 forward the Change in RDAP and \u00a7 3621(e) Status form to the Unit Team, the CSD, and the\nDSCC team responsible for the inmate\u2019s sentence computation. (3) \u00a7 3621(e) Conditional Release. The Unit Team will use the Notice of \u00a7 3621(e) Date form\nin preparing the RRC packet for the Warden\u2019s approval. Upon approval, the RRC packet will be\nforwarded to Community Corrections. (4) Unit Team Final Review. Before an eligible inmate is processed for early release to an\nRRC, the Unit Manager or designee will complete the Unit Team Final Review form. Ordinarily,\nthis will occur 30 days before RRC transfer or release. This review ensures that all criteria for\nearly release have been met. If any SENTRY codes have been replaced with fail or ineligible\ncodes, the inmate is not eligible for an early release. P5331.02 3/16/2009 Federal Regulations: bold type.

Implementing instructions: regular type. Page 10 (5) RRC Incident Report. If a previously eligible inmate was returned from RRC placement\ndue to an incident report and that incident report is later expunged by the Discipline Hearing\nOfficer, the Unit Team will:\n\u2022 notify the DAPC immediately and request the SENTRY failure assignment be replaced with\nthe completion assignment, and the SENTRY appropriate early release eligibility assignment\nis entered; and\n\u2022 complete the Notification of RRC Placement Date form (BP-A0628) and send it to the CSD\nand the appropriate DSCC computation staff. c. DSCC Computation Staff. Ordinarily, the DSCC\u2019s role is to ensure the Sentence\nMonitoring and Computation data for an inmate is appropriate and current at all times. (1) Changes in Conditional Release Date. Any changes required in the computation of a\n\u00a7 3621(e) Conditional Release date will be made by DSCC upon receipt of one of the following\nForms:\n\u2022 the Notice of \u00a7 3621(e) Date form;\n\u2022 the Change in RDAP and \u00a7 3621(e) Status form; or\n\u2022 the Notification of RRC Placement Date form. The DSCC staff will make the appropriate computation changes within 15 working days. (2) RRC Placement Date. When the inmate has been accepted for RRC placement, the\nNotification of RRC Placement Date form will be sent to the appropriate DSCC computation\nstaff and the CSD by the Warden. Upon receipt of this form, the designated DSCC staff will\nenter the \u00a7 3621E CCPS (complete community program) date into the inmate\u2019s sentence\ncomputation within 15 working days. DSCC staff will recalculate the sentence to show a release\ndate via RDAP early release pursuant to \u00a7 3621(e). (3) Request to Delay, Remove or Reinstate Early Release. When notified by the Transitional\nDrug Abuse Treatment Coordinator (T-DATC) via the Request to Delay, Remove or Reinstate\nEarly Release form (BP-A0768), the DSCC will recalculate the sentence computation within 15\nworking days of receipt of the form. The DSCC will enter a \u201c/\u201d in the \u00a7 3621E CCPS (complete\ncommunity program) date field, SENTRY will set the \u00a7 3621E REL date to \u201c/\u201d, and the inmate\u2019s\nprojected satisfaction/release date will be set to his/her projected Statutory Release Date (SRD),\nand the corresponding satisfaction/release method GCT REL. d. TDAT and Community Corrections Staff. \u00a7 550.55(c)(3) If inmates cannot fulfill\ntheir community-based treatment obligations by the presumptive release date, we\nmay adjust provisional release dates by the least amount of time necessary to\nallow inmates to fulfill their treatment obligations. In practice, it is the T-DATC who\nadjusts all provisional release dates. P5331.02 3/16/2009 Federal Regulations: bold type. Implementing instructions: regular type. Page 11 (1) Transitional Drug Abuse Treatment Coordinator. When an inmate is placed in\ncommunity-based treatment, the T-DATC monitors the inmate\u2019s treatment. Therefore, all\nrecommendations for changes in an inmate\u2019s early release date must be initiated by the T-DATC.",

When an inmate is placed in\ncommunity-based treatment, the T-DATC monitors the inmate\u2019s treatment. Therefore, all\nrecommendations for changes in an inmate\u2019s early release date must be initiated by the T-DATC. This includes delays or removal of early release for treatment related issues, escapes from the\nRRC, RRC failures, disallowance of Good Conduct Time by the Discipline Hearing Officer, etc. For example, if an inmate fails the RRC, the CCM will contact the T-DATC via GroupWise to\nrequest a change in the inmate\u2019s status. Additional guidance on delaying and/or removing early release is contained in the Program\nStatement on Community Transitional Drug Abuse Treatment. (2) T-DATC Review. The T-DATC is responsible for reviewing all requests to delay or remove\nan inmate\u2019s early release date. Supporting documentation should be included in the review. The\nT-DATC will approve or disapprove the request. (3) Request to Delay, Remove or Reinstate Early Release. If the T-DATC decides to delay or\nremove early release, he or she will complete the Request to Delay, Remove or Reinstate Early\nRelease form, scan the document, and submit it to the appropriate team at the DSCC. If the staff\nat the DSCC have not calculated/assumed the related sentence computation, they will need to\ncontact the parent facility for an electronic version of the Judgment and Commitment file to carry\nout the change in the release date. (4) SENTRY Assignments. All SENTRY assignments should be updated by the TDAT and/or\ncommunity corrections staff as such changes occur. At no time should an inmate have a failure\nSENTRY assignment while maintaining an early release date. This is to be monitored closely by\nthe TDAT, community corrections, and the DSCC. (5) Reinstatement of \u00a7 3621(e) Date. If an inmate has received an incident report that is later\nexpunged by the DHO, the appropriate staff, T-DATC or DAPC, depending on the inmate\u2019s\nlocation, will complete the Change in RDAP and \u00a7 3621(e) Status form or the Request to Delay,\nRemove or Reinstate Early Release form and immediately scan the form and send it to the DSCC\nto reinstate the inmate\u2019s early release. Once the inmate begins TDAT, the T-DATC will decide if\nthe inmate\u2019s provisional early release date will be delayed. Delays of an early release date will\nallow the inmate to complete TDAT. (6) Redesignation. If it is determined that the inmate must be redesignated, the CCM will\nreview the case and submit a redesignation request to the DSCC. 12. CERTIFYING EARLY RELEASE Upon an inmate\u2019s completion of TDAT, the T-DATC must certify to the DSCC that the inmate\nhas completed all requirements of RDAP. This certification assures the inmate has successfully\ncompleted all of the requirements that earn him or her an early release.
