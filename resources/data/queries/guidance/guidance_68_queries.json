U.S. Department of Justice\nFederal Bureau of Prisons Program\nStatement OPI:\nNUMBER:\nDATE:\nSUBJECT: OGC\n1351.05\n9/19/2002\nRelease of Information PART ONE: [GENERAL PROVISIONS AND PROCEDURES] 1. [PURPOSE AND SCOPE \u00a7 513.30. This subpart establishes\nprocedures for the release of requested records in possession of\nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons (\"Bureau\"). It is intended to\nimplement provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),\n5 U.S.C. 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and to\nsupplement Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations concerning the\nproduction or disclosure of records or information,\n28 CFR part 16.] The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act (PA)\ninteract with each other in two areas:\n# When any person requests access to records about himself or\nherself, both statutes become potentially applicable; # When any person requests access to another individual's\nrecord through the FOIA, the Privacy Act may prohibit the\ndisclosure of that record unless FOIA requires it. The determination of what information may be released requires\nBureau staff to have a basic understanding of both the FOIA and\nthe Privacy Act, as well as a working knowledge of DOJ and Bureau\npolicy. Bureau staff also should be aware that the Privacy Act\nestablishes criminal penalties and civil liabilities for\nunauthorized disclosures. The appropriate Regional Counsel shall\nbe contacted when staff are uncertain whether requested\ninformation may be disclosed. Staff shall become familiar with the policy governing release of\ninformation, with special emphasis upon those areas with direct\napplication to the employee's job. Information requests submitted by the union pursuant to\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7114 will be addressed in accordance with this\nprovision and relevant case law.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES. This Program Statement is being revised\nto prohibit inmates from obtaining and possessing photocopies of\ntheir Pre-sentence Reports (PSR) and the Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) from their Judgment(s) in a Criminal Case. The purpose of\nthis prohibition is to protect inmates from being coerced by\nother inmates to produce their PSRs and SORs for illicit\npurposes. Inmates will be permitted to review their PSRs and\nSORs, but cannot obtain or possess photocopies. This revision\nalso introduces a new form which inmates can use to facilitate\ncourt review of their PSRs or SORs. If local procedures are changed, notification to the union and\ntraining will be handled in accordance with the Master Agreement. 3. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.\nare: The expected results of this program a. Information will be released to a requester in accordance\nwith Federal law and the regulations and policies of the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice. b. Inmate Freedom of Information Act requests to the Central\nOffice will be reduced by increasing the use of institution\nprocedures that provide for inmate review of Bureau policy\ndocuments and records in Inmate Central Files. c. Future litigation pertaining to FOIA/Privacy Act issues\nwill be reduced. 4. DIRECTIVES AFFECTED a. Directive Rescinded\nPS 1351.04 b.

Questions regarding the applicability of exemptions may be\nreferred to the appropriate Regional Counsel or to the Office of\nGeneral Counsel. d. Examples of documents or information which ordinarily may\nbe withheld from disclosure include the examples which follow. These examples are not intended to represent an all-inclusive\nlist of every situation when FOIA exemptions may apply, nor are\nthe FOIA exemptions cited for each example the only ones which\nmay apply to the examples provided.

Requests by one inmate for public information\nconcerning other inmates must be reviewed very\ncarefully, as prison security concerns may outweigh the\nright to a FOIA disclosure. ! A denial of such public information to an inmate\nrequester may be done only with the Regional Counsel's\napproval, after assessing the risks that disclosure\nmight pose to the safety of the inmate(s) whose records\nare being sought and to other inmates and staff in the\ninstitution.

For safety\nand security reasons, inmates are prohibited from obtaining or\npossessing photocopies of their PSRs, SORs, or other equivalent\nnon-U.S. Code sentencing documents (e.g., D.C., state, foreign,\nmilitary, etc.). Inmates violating this provision are subject to\ndisciplinary action. This prohibition applies only to the SOR portion of an\ninmate\u2019s Judgment in a Criminal Case. The rest of the Judgment\ndocument remains releasable unless circumstances or policy\ndictate otherwise. PSRs and SORs received by mail will be\ntreated as contraband, and handled according to the Mail\nManagement Manual. This prohibition does not apply to inmates in Bureau of\nPrisons custody with a need to review their PSRs prior to\nsentencing. For example, a pretrial inmate scheduled for\nsentencing may possess and review the PSR in preparation for\nsentencing. After sentencing, however, the inmate is prohibited\nfrom retaining a copy of the PSR. reasons. The Bureau implemented this policy for the following\n# Many PSRs and SORs contain information\nregarding the inmates\u2019 government assistance,\nfinancial resources, community affiliations,\netc. # The Bureau has documented an emerging problem\nwhere inmates pressure other inmates for a\ncopy of their PSRs and SORs to learn if they\nare informants, gang members, have financial\nresources, etc. PS 1351.05\n9/19/2002\nPage 17\n# Inmates who refuse to provide the documents\nare threatened, assaulted, and/or seek\nprotective custody.

The form, which includes instructions for\ncompletion, must be available to inmates in the housing units and\nlaw libraries. Although prohibited from obtaining or possessing\nphotocopies, federal inmates are entitled under the FOIA to\naccess their own PSRs (see United States Department of Justice v.\nJulian, 486 U.S. 1 (1988)) and SORs. Inmates must be provided\nreasonable opportunities to access and review their PSRs, SORs,\nor other equivalent non-U.S. Code sentencing documents (e.g.,\nD.C., state, foreign, military, etc.). Inmates are responsible\nfor requesting an opportunity to access and review these records\nwith unit staff in accordance with the Program Statement on\nInmate Central File, Privacy Folder, and Parole Mini-Files. To\nfacilitate inmate access and review, PSRs and SORs should\nordinarily be maintained in the disclosable portion of the\ncentral file unless significant safety and security concerns\ndictate otherwise. In addition to the above procedures, other provisions\nof the FOIA may require limiting inmate access to PSRs and SORs.

The Commission, of\ncourse, wants to use all the information in the documents you\nprepare. If you determine that some information may not be\ndisclosed, in accordance with the guidelines listed above, you\nmust prepare a summary of excluded information if it is to be\nused by the Parole Commission. This summary, as well as the\ndisclosable portions of the document, will then be available to\nthe inmate, and the Commission thereby be permitted to review the\nentire document. The summary need only be phrased in general\nterms to enable the inmate to respond to the essential\nallegations made in excluded material. It should not reveal\nspecific information which might compromise a legitimate need for\nconfidentiality. OPTIONS FOR DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION There are three options which exist under Federal law with\nrespect to disclosure to the inmate and to the U.S. Parole\nCommission of the information prepared by your agency. Option 1 - You may authorize complete disclosure of the\ndocument. The document is available for inmate review and\ncopying. Court disclosure instructions, if any, will be\nfollowed. Option 2 - You may recommend exclusion of a portion or all\nof the document from disclosure. Please identify the part(s) of\nthe document you consider exempt form disclosure and prepare an\nadequate summary of the excluded material. The Federal Bureau of\nPrisons will review the reasons given in accordance with the\nguidelines listed in this letter. If at least one of the\nguidelines is met, both the summary and the disclosable portion\nof the document, if any, will be available to the inmate. If the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons determines the document to be entirely\ndisclosable, the document will be returned to you, and no copy\nwill be retained by the Federal Bureau of Prisons or for release\nto the U.S. Parole Commission or to the inmate. Option 3 - You may refuse to authorize disclosure of the\ndocument, or a summary in any form to the inmate.
