In 1930, Department of Justice Circular No. 2126, titled Rules\nGoverning the Control of Prisoner\u2019s Funds at the Several Penal and Correctional\nInstitutions (August 1, 1930), authorized and established a Commissary at each institution. The\nCommissary was created to provide a bank-type account for inmate monies and \u201cfor the\nprocurement of articles not regularly issued as part of the institution administration.\u201d Circular\n2244, Rules Governing the Control of Prisoners Funds at Several Penal and Correctional\nInstitutions (January 1, 1932), superseded Circular No. 2126 and established separate U.S.\nTreasury accounts for the \u201cPrisoners Trust Fund\u201d and the \u201cCommissary and Welfare Funds.\u201d The existence and operation of the prison Commissaries was approved by Congress in 1932 in the\nDepartment of Justice\u2019s 1933 appropriation bill. In 1934, Congress designated the \u201cfunds of\nfederal prisoners\u201d and \u201cCommissary funds\u201d as \u201ctrust funds\u201d (31 U.S.C. 1321). Monies accruing\nto these funds were appropriated and disbursed in compliance with the terms of the trust. Section 108 of the Department of Justice, General Provisions, Department of Justice, Public Law\n104-134 (April 26, 1996), provided that in Fiscal Year 1996 and thereafter, amounts in the Federal\nPrison Systems Commissary Fund that are not needed for operations are kept on deposit or\ninvested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States. Earnings on investments are\ndeposited in the Commissary Fund. Section 108 of the Department of Justice, General Provisions in the Fiscal Year 1999 and\nthereafter Omnibus Bill and Conference Report Language, Public Law 105-277 (October 21,\n1998), clarified authority for expenditures from the Commissary Fund for an Inmate Telephone\nSystem and for other purposes, regardless of whether such an expenditure is security-related, for\nprograms, goods, and services for the benefit of inmates (not otherwise prohibited by law),\nincluding:\n\u25a0 Installation, operation, and maintenance of the Inmate Telephone System. \u25a0 Payment for equipment purchased or leased for the Inmate Telephone System. \u25a0 Salaries, benefits, and other expenses of personnel who install, operate, and maintain the\nInmate Telephone System. The \u201cCommissary Fund\u201d is generally referred to as the \u201cTrust Fund\u201d and the \u201cfunds of federal\nprisoners\u201d as the \u201cInmate Deposit Fund.\u201d The Trust Fund\u2019s purposes remain essentially the same\nas when created:\n\u25a0 To maintain inmates\u2019 monies (Deposit Fund) while they are incarcerated.\n\u25a0",

When the Trust Fund Appropriation is used under the TRO function, entries\nare automatically posted in the automated accounting system. Staff responsible for inventory management only use X4 as the appropriation for the TRO\nfunction. Transfer through the S&E Appropriation is no longer required. \u25a0 Transfer from Trust Fund to Other Appropriations. Institutions planning to transfer\npersonal property from the Trust Fund Appropriation to another appropriation must submit a\ncompleted Stores Requisition, Invoice & Transfer Receipt (BP-A0100) through the Regional\nTrust Fund Administrator to the Chief, Trust Fund Branch, before transfer. This does not\napply to equipment purchased under the Trust Fund profit sharing program. (7) Trust Fund Equipment Priority List. Annually, institutions develop their equipment\nneeds along with the budget request for operational expenses in accordance with the Budget\nExecution Manual. Each institution is given a minor equipment budget as a standard part of the\ninitial financial plan for purchasing Commissary-related equipment only. These funds may be\nexpended for minor equipment under one Special Authorization Number (provided with the\nfinancial plan), except that these funds are not used to purchase computer equipment or peripherals\nattached to any Trust Fund system, local area network (LAN), or wide area network (WAN). An individual Major Equipment Justification (BP-A0135) is required for any requested major or\nminor equipment (controlled, capitalized, and non-capitalized), in addition to the initial allotment\nor for any computer equipment. Funding and Special Authorization Numbers for approved items\nare included in the initial financial plan.",

Implementing instructions: this type. 23 2.4 TRUST FUND INMATE WORKERS Inmates receive compensation from the Trust Fund Appropriation for work performed in support\nof Commissary activities. Relatively short absences due to callouts, hospitalization, sick line,\netc., do not affect the period covered. Inmates who are placed in Inmate Financial Responsibility Refuse Status and/or in Maintenance\nPay Status may not work in the Trust Fund operation. a. Rate of Pay. The hourly rate of pay for inmates assigned to Commissary activities is:\n$0.55 per hour starting. $0.75 per hour after 3 months\u2019 service, if warranted. $0.95 per hour after 6 months\u2019 service, if warranted. $1.20 per hour after 9 months\u2019 service, if warranted. Any increase in pay (not to exceed $1.20 per hour) is based on the inmate\u2019s work performance and\navailability of funds. b. Bonus Pay. Bonus Pay may be awarded to Trust Fund inmate workers. It may not exceed\none-half of the inmate\u2019s monthly pay. A recommendation is made by the work assignment\nsupervisor. c. Part-time Workers. Inmates working part-time in the Commissary during the evening and\nat other jobs during the day may be paid Inmate Performance or UNICOR pay for daytime jobs\nand Trust Fund pay for evening work. Good judgment must be used when employing an inmate\nin two areas, considering both work schedules and security conflicts. d. Restrictions on Inmate Duties.

P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 25 Chapter 3. COMMISSARY OPERATIONS\n3.1 SECURITY\na. Commissary Security. Security is of high importance to staff involved in Trust Fund\noperations. Merchandise lost through negligence or theft by inmates reduces funds available for\nthe Trust Fund. The minimum security standards for Commissary procedures are:\n\u25a0 Inmate workers entering or leaving the Commissary are pat searched. Occasional visual\nsearches (strip searches) are authorized and shall be conducted per the Program Statement\nSearches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas.\n\u25a0 A staff member supervises the removal of all trash leaving the Commissary. Boxes and\ncartons shall be broken down. \u25a0 Inmates who steal merchandise from the Commissary shall be subject to disciplinary action per\nthe Program Statement Inmate Discipline Program.\n\u25a0 No more inmates than staff can manage and control are permitted to work in the Commissary. Inmates shall never work in the Commissary without staff supervision, and shall never be\nlocked in the Commissary without a staff member present.\n\u25a0 At least annually, a Correctional Services staff member shall perform a complete security\nreview, including a check of the physical facilities of the Trust Fund operation. A written\nreport must be sent to the Trust Fund Supervisor. The Trust Fund Supervisor will then notify\nthe Chief, Trust Fund Branch, through the Regional Trust Fund Administrator of significant\nproblems identified in the reviews. b. Key Security. Trust Fund operation keys are \u201crestricted\u201d keys and are to be issued only to\ndesignated staff. The Trust Fund Supervisor and employees assigned to the Commissary may\nhave keys to the Commissary and storage areas on a 24-hour check-out basis. Employees not\ndirectly assigned to the Commissary or storeroom do not have keys to these areas. A key to the\nCommissary and storage areas is kept under glass in the control room for emergencies (e.g., fire or\nrefrigeration breakdown). When it is in the Bureau\u2019s best interest that Trust Fund keys remain at the institution, use the\nfollowing procedures: A special wood/metal box(s) with a glass front, large enough to contain\nthe entire Trust Fund key ring(s), or an individual Trust Fund key ring, kept within the control\nroom. At the end of each work day, the Trust Fund ring(s) is locked securely in this box. A key to the\nlocked box may be checked out on a 24-hour basis to employees assigned to the Commissary and\nthe Trust Fund Supervisor. In an emergency, the glass may be broken to obtain the keys. After\nany such incident, a memorandum is sent to the Warden with a copy to the Captain and Trust Fund\nSupervisor documenting the situation that required emergency access. c. Hot Room Security. Each institution establishes local procedures for a \u201chot room\u201d in the\nWarehouse to secure Trust Fund merchandise not directly received into the Commissary.

The\nP4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 26 \u201chot room\u201d is a secure locked area in the Warehouse separate from other storage areas. Only\nTrust Fund merchandise is stored there. Inmates are not allowed access to the \u201chot room\u201d unless\nsupervised by Warehouse/Trust Fund staff. When Warehouse space is not available, Trust Fund\nmerchandise is received directly into the Commissary. Trust Fund merchandise is never left in an\nunsecured area. d. Merchandise Security. To ensure that sales items are not concealed inside one another or\notherwise mishandled, a staff member passes merchandise through the sales window to the inmate. Staff do not rely on inmate employees for a count of the quantity sold or for item numbers of the\nmerchandise sold. Exercise care in moving inventory from the Warehouse to the Commissary. When merchandise\nmust be moved across the compound, consider a covered, securable container. No more inmates\nthan can be properly supervised are used to transport merchandise. Small valuable items (copy cards, MP3 players, etc.) are kept in a secure locked location. Only a\nreasonable number of items expected to be sold during a sales period are removed from the secure\nlocation. e. Postage Stamp Security. Due to the unique risk associated with management of postage\nstamps in a correctional environment, the following procedures are required. Postage stamps\nbrought to the sales counter are secured in a locking drawer, cabinet, or other lockable container at\nthe sales counter, and returned to the safe when sales are not being conducted. All stamp transfers\nmust be generated utilizing TRUFACS and require both staff signatures. The stamp transfer\nreceipt shall be maintained in the receiver\u2019s stamp compartment until the next semi-annual\ninventory is reconciled. TRUFACS updates each Warehouse/Trust Fund staff member\u2019s stamp inventory automatically as\nstamps are sold. Each Warehouse/ Trust Fund staff member reconciles the physical stamp\ninventory to the TRUFACS stamp inventory at the end of the day. Any overages/shortages\nidentified during the physical count are reported in writing no later than the following business day\nto the Trust Fund Supervisor. The Trust Fund Supervisor then enters an inventory adjustment in TRUFACS that is added to the\nother adjustments for that accounting period. The overage/shortage in TRUFACS for that\naccounting period generates a Semi-Annual Inventory Adjustment. The Trust Fund Supervisor\nmakes all reasonable efforts to ensure the affected Warehouse/Trust Fund staff member\u2019s\ninventories are adjusted in TRUFACS before beginning additional sales. Note: Under no circumstances may staff members set aside any stamp overage to offset a\npotential future shortage. Commissary stamp inventory is maintained only in TRUFACS. f. Postage Stamp Storage. A fire-resistant, sturdy cabinet/safe with separate combination\nlocking compartments is used to keep the stock of stamps for the Commissary. This cabinet/safe\nP4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 27 must be physically substantial or secured to the building structure or floor.

Staff will lock the safe compartment door when\nstamps are kept in the safe. Note: Institutions with existing file cabinets/safes with separate key locking compartments may\nkeep them. New cabinets/safes must contain combination locking compartments. The file cabinet/safe is kept in a room or office that is secure and separate from the general\nCommissary stock areas. The safe cannot be in an area where inmates may have an opportunity to\ntamper with it. Inmates are never in the room/office when the door(s)/compartment(s) are\nunlocked. Ideal locations include a locked Commissary staff office or \u201chot room.\u201d Each staff member handling stamps is assigned a separate compartment with a separate\ncombination lock.

Safe combinations shall be changed at least once each year. Individual compartment\ncombinations are changed whenever there is a change in staff in a Commissary position using the\nparticular compartment. Institution security officers, or locally procured services of a security\nofficer, may be used to obtain technical instructions for changing combinations. A log will be\nkept indicating date and reason for the change. The actual setting of the new combination(s) is personally performed by the staff member assigned\nto the compartment.

To lessen the disparity between affluent inmates and inmates\nwith few resources, the Bureau has implemented a spending limitation of $360 per month. The spending limitation is the maximum amount an inmate is allowed to spend per month on sales\nitems not excluded from the monthly spending limitation, described in paragraph b. below. The spending limitation may be increased by $50 during the November/December holiday period. The increased spending limitation for each inmate is in effect for no more than one validation\nperiod. a. Limitations. Each Warden sets a monthly spending limitation not to exceed the national\nlimitation for Commissary sales. To enable institution management to control or restrict\ngambling and other illicit activities involving payoffs, local controls (including quantity\nlimitations) may be set to restrict trafficking of Commissary items. b. Exclusions from the Spending Limitation. The only items excluded from the spending\nlimitation are:\n\u25a0 Postage stamps. \u25a0 Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) patches.\n\u25a0 Over-the-counter medications/medical products/vitamins/mineral supplements as defined in\nSection 3.3.f(15). \u25a0 Kosher/Halal shelf-stable entrees for inmates who are FRP Refuse. \u25a0 Copy cards and copy paper. c.

Within the following guidelines, the Warden and designated staff\ndecide, based on the security, programs, climate, character and composition of the inmate\npopulation, as well as Trust Fund infrastructure limitations, what items to sell in the Commissary. Consumable items and medical items sold shall complement, not supplement, diet and medical\ncare provided to the inmate population. Institutions are encouraged to offer Commissary goods that are acceptable for inmates with\nreligious dietary restrictions. To expand the availability of foods for Islamic and Jewish\nadherents, when costs are comparable and products meet the needs of the institution, products\nshould be selected from a variety of name-brand foods that have a reliable kosher certification or\nare free of pork and pork by-products. In addition, during the week of Passover each year (early spring), inmate requests for certified\nkosher-for-Passover snacks should be accommodated using normal Trust Fund procedures. Information about the products and certifications is available from the institution Chaplain or the\nReligious Services Branch, Central Office. b. Approved Items. Each institution establishes items approved for sale through the\nCommissary. Per the Program Statement Inmate Personal Property, a list of all items identified\n\u201cfor local use only\u201d is posted in the immediate Commissary area; these items are identified on the\nshopping list. c.

Use the following procedures to determine\nselling prices. a. Cost Price. The cost of an item is established in TRUFACS when the initial Receiving\nReport is generated. The cost is based on a sellable unit, defined as the smallest individual unit\nsold in the Commissary. In the rare case when the purchase of a non-SPO regular item includes a\nP4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 37 shipping charge, the shipping charge shall not be included when determining the cost price of the\nitem. b. Mark-up and Selling Price Computation. The mark-up for the selling price of each item\nordered and sold in the Commissary is automatically calculated based on the cost and mark-up\nselected in TRUFACS. The mark-up is based on the following:\n0%\n30 to 40%\nPre-Printed\nNon-Physical See paragraph d. below. Standard items/SPOs purchased. The standard/SPO mark-up parameter\nwill be set at the National level. Sales price printed on packaging (see below). Selling price of items not physically maintained in inventory (e.g., photo\nvouchers). Generally, the Federal Government does not pay taxes (State, local, or Federal) on purchases. However, when payment of taxes is required, these steps are followed:\n\u25a0 Divide the total tax charge(s) by the number of sellable units taxed. \u25a0 Add the tax per sellable unit to the cost price of the lowest sellable unit. \u25a0 Use this amount as the cost price for receiving purposes.",

Occasionally, the selling price, rounded to the next highest nickel, may exceed the manufacturer\u2019s\nprinted price. Then the selling price must be set at the manufacturer\u2019s pre-printed price, even\nthough it may be in odd cents. In instances when the calculated selling price is less than the\nmanufacturer\u2019s printed selling price, the calculated selling price is used. Pre-printed applies only\nto pre-printed, packaged, \u201cacross the counter\u201d sales items (potato chips, pretzels, etc.). It does not\napply to catalog prices such as those for SPO items (e.g., leather companies\u2019 catalogs). c. Coupons/Tokens. Coupons or tokens sold through the Commissary and used to purchase\nitems or services are, without exception, marked up in the same way as stocked items. d. Selling Price With No Mark-up. The following regularly stocked items or SPOs have no\nmark-up added to the cost and are not rounded to the next $0.05:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Postage.

Smoking Cessation Program materials. Passover meals during Passover. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 38 e. Selling Price Change Trust Fund Merchandise. Old and new stock may not be maintained\nat different selling prices. Once new merchandise is received at a price other than the current\nselling price (either higher or lower), the selling price changes for all identical items in stock. Example: 17 units selling for $0.35 each are in the Commissary; 120 units of the identical item\nare received. The new shipment of 120 units cost $0.20 each. The computed selling price is\n$0.26 each and requires rounding to $0.30 each. In addition, the selling price of the 17 units on\nhand decreases to $0.30. f. Trust Fund Price Lists. Institutions distribute lists of Commissary items and their selling\nprices to help inmates prepare shopping lists in advance. g. Refunds/Exchanges. Sales are final after the inmate accepts/inspects the item(s), receives\nthe sales receipt, and leaves the Commissary, except for undamaged, unactivated MP3 players in\nthe original packaging. h. Warranties. Inmates may have damaged warrantied items repaired/replaced by the vendor;\nhowever, items repaired/replaced (excluding Commissary-purchased MP3 players) shall be\nforwarded to an outside address at the inmates\u2019 expense. Inmates may elect to have warranty\nclaims for Commissary-purchased MP3 players shipped to their designated Federal institution. If\nmailed to the institution, the package is addressed to the attention of the Trust Fund Supervisor and\nreturned to the inmate. i. Manufacture/Retail Coupons. Coupons are not honored at the Commissary. j. Rebates. Institutions shall not accept cash rebates for merchandise purchases. k. Samples. Non-food product samples received from a vendor are returned to the vendor or\ndestroyed after evaluation. Food samples considered for sale in the Commissary are only\nsampled by staff designated by the Trust Fund Supervisor.",

Promotion/Quantity Discounts. Items identical to those ordered received with an order as\npart of a promotion or quantity discount are received via a Receiving Report and the cost per item\ncomputed using the total quantity received. If promotional or discounted items are received after the original order Receiving Report has been\nprocessed, a donated Receiving Report is prepared using the latest cost price and selling price for\nthat item.

Implementing instructions: this type. 39 3.5 SPECIAL PURPOSE ORDERS (SPO) It is not practical to stock all approved items of a special nature, such as books, hobbycrafts, etc. An SPO is an inmate request to purchase an approved item or items not routinely sold in the\nCommissary. Periodic reviews are made to determine whether any SPO item should be included\nas a routine stock item. SPOs are not approved solely for ordering a different color, brand, or\nquality of an item currently sold. Requests to purchase these items are approved on an individual\nbasis. Inmates are limited to one SPO per month. The maximum dollar amount allowed for SPO items\nis $300 (cost price excluding shipping charges) per quarter. Exceptions may be made for projects\nwhich require items to be purchased from more than one vendor. The Warden approves, in writing, individual leather items with a unit cost of $100 or more for sale\nto inmates. The Warden also approves leather items whose size could pose a security risk. This\nauthority cannot be re-delegated. a. Inmate Procedures. Inmates desiring special purpose items submit a signed Special Purpose\nOrder Request \u2013 Inmate (BP-A0200) to designated staff. Note: The SPO Request form is used in place of the Request for Purchase (BP-A0101), and the\ndocumentation for Inmate Personal Property Record (BP-A0383). TRUFACS generates a\nPurchase Card Purchase Order or a Purchase Order and Receiving Report.\nb. Approval Process. The approving official verifies that the SPO Request form is complete,\nincludes current prices and catalog numbers, and, if the inmate is on FRP Refuse status, that\npurchase limitations outlined in the Program Statement Inmate Financial Responsibility\nProgram are not exceeded. Note: Inmates in FRP Refuse status may not be denied the ability to purchase Kosher/Halal\nshelf-stable entrees through the SPO Program. The approving official ensures that limitations such as frequency of orders, single order maximum\ndollar amount, or quarterly dollar amount are not exceeded. Approval is indicated on all copies of the SPO Request. After the approving official signs it, it is\ndelivered to the Trust Fund Supervisor in a secure manner. c. Numbering. TRUFACS assigns the SPO number as a special item number that is sequential\nfollowing the two-digit fiscal year (FY 05; 05-0040, 05-0041).",

TRUFACS assigns the SPO number as a special item number that is sequential\nfollowing the two-digit fiscal year (FY 05; 05-0040, 05-0041). The item description contains the\nSPO number and the amount is encumbered automatically when the TRUFACS SPO is created. The TRUFACS-generated SPO number is recorded on the original SPO Request. Ordinarily, SPOs are ordered and entered on a weekly basis following receipt by Trust Fund staff. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 40 d. Markup. The calculation for the selling price is based on cost, markup, and transportation\ncharges. e. Encumbrances. The inmate\u2019s account is encumbered automatically for each SPO ordered in\nTRUFACS. The Trust Fund Supervisor ensures the SPO Request form is returned to the\nApproving Official if an SPO was rejected based on insufficient funds, exceeding the monthly\nquantity limit of SPOs or quarterly dollar limitations, spending limit restriction, or FRP Refuse\nstatus. If an inmate refuses to purchase the SPO after it has been received, the encumbrance will\nremain on the requesting inmate\u2019s account until the SPO is sold. f. Procurement Procedures. The SPO Request form, and any other ordering documents, is\nsent to Trust Fund staff. Once the SPO is created in TRUFACS, Trust Fund staff attach the\nTRUFACS-generated SPO to the original SPO Request Form and forward the non-purchase card\norder to Acquisitions staff to verify and order. The Government purchase card order is forwarded to the Trust Fund Supervisor for approval, then\nback to the card holder to order. When possible, SPOs are purchased by Government purchase\ncard by Trust Fund staff. A copy of the SPO, and any other ordering documents, is sent to the Warehouse. g. Receiving. Upon receipt of the SPO at the institution, a TRUFACS-generated Receiving\nReport is prepared per normal receiving procedures for Trust Fund resale merchandise. h. Selling. A particular SPO encumbrance is released automatically; funds are deducted from\nthe inmate\u2019s account at the time the merchandise is sold to the inmate through regular sales\nprocedures. The inmate signs a sales ticket (unless fingerprint sale). The appropriate number of\ncopies of the SPO Request form are signed at the time the inmate receives the article(s), verifying\nthat the article(s) has been received. i. Filing Instructions. A copy of the SPO Request form is given to the inmate. A signed copy\nof the original SPO Request form is retained. j. Transferred Inmates. SPOs received for inmates who have been released or transferred may\nbe disposed of locally. Examples of disposition include: return to the vendor, sale to another\ninmate at full markup price, or sale to another inmate at a reduced price. An SPO sold to another\ninmate applies SPO limitations for that inmate. 3.6 COMMISSARY SALES PROCEDURES\na. Sales Procedures - Non-Fingerprint Identification.

In these rare circumstances, the Trust Fund Supervisor is given written documentation to\nsupport the sale, attached to the original sales receipt and filed by sales staff. Note: Sales to incorrect inmates due to a failure in the fingerprint software or hardware are\ncorrected by crediting the appropriate inmate account after receipt of written approval from the\nTrust Fund Branch. No other action shall be taken. 3.7 INVENTORY CONTROL\na. Purchase of Resale Items. Trust Fund contracts and POs are subject to the same rules,\nregulations, and limitations governing institution transactions, except that it is optional for\ninstitutions to obtain competitive bids for Trust Fund merchandise purchased for resale in the\nCommissary. In addition, it is not mandatory that Federal Supply Service (FSS) schedules be\nused for purchase of items for resale. Per the Commissioner, General Services Administration (GSA), on September 13, 1963, stock\nitems may also be purchased through GSA for resale in the Commissary. When the procurement\nis not competitive, and specific brands of merchandise are required, exercise care that the\nprocurement is made directly from a manufacturer or distributor who will provide a fair and\nreasonable cost. b. Purchase Procedures. Warehouse/Trust Fund staff may review a TRUFACS \u201chot list\u201d to\nhelp determine ordering requirements. In addition, it is recommended that an Item Sales Analysis Report be produced. A TRUFACS PO\nis generated for all resale items purchased, including Government purchase card purchases. A\nRequest for Purchase (Delivery/Task Order) (BP-A0101) is not used for resale purchases. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 44 Based on the TRUFACS-recommended quantity, as well as current and historical sales trends,\nWarehouse/Trust Fund staff prepare a TRUFACS PO to replenish stock and submit to the\nappropriate approving official. Non-purchase card POs are forwarded to Acquisitions staff;\npurchase card POs are forwarded to the card holder for processing. The non-purchase card purchase of resale items, based on requirements submitted by\nWarehouse/Trust Fund staff, is the responsibility of Acquisitions.",

The non-purchase card purchase of resale items, based on requirements submitted by\nWarehouse/Trust Fund staff, is the responsibility of Acquisitions. Acquisitions staff use the\nTRUFACS-generated POs as the official PO document and process per the Program Statement\nBureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy. The Supervisor reviews outstanding POs monthly to\nensure accuracy and validity. c. Government Purchase Card Procedures for Commissary Resale Merchandise. Use of\nthe Government purchase card for purchases of Trust Fund resale merchandise is strongly\nrecommended. However, when this method of procurement is used, a Government purchase card\nis established that is used only to purchase resale merchandise, not for purchases such as Trust\nFund supplies. The following procedures apply for purchases of resale merchandise using the Government\npurchase card. Refer to the Program Statement Accounting \u2013 Recording Obligations for\nguidelines and procedures related to accruals and payments for resale merchandise. General\nprocedures for use of the Government purchase card are found in the Bureau of Prisons\nAcquisition Policy and TRM. Note: These special procedures are different from the procedures for purchasing other than resale\nitems. These procedures are necessary to maintain control of the Commissary inventory and\nmatch costs to revenue properly in the same accounting period. Warehouse/Trust Fund staff retain a copy of the Government purchase card PO until the order is\nreceived. Once the order is received and quantities verified, TRUFACS generates a Receiving\nReport, which is distributed to the purchase card holder along with supporting packing slips and\nreceipts, and to the Warehouse or Commissary for the chronological Receiving Report file. The cardholder follows procedures in the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy for maintaining\nrecords and verifying the monthly Memo Statement. The Approving Official follows procedures in the Acquisition TRM for maintaining records and\nreviewing monthly Government purchase card statements. The Bureau-wide payment to the vendor for all Government purchase card purchases is generated\nautomatically at the Central Office; institutions are notified via the automated accounting system\nmessage once the payment has been made. The Program Statement Accounting \u2013 Recording\nObligations describes accounting procedures for establishing the accrual for resale merchandise. Resale merchandise should be purchased and recorded to sub-object 2670. The appropriate P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 45 automated accounting system report is reviewed before the end of each month to ensure the\npayments are recorded to the correct sub-object. The Approving Official maintains the Master Account Summary Reports and copies of monthly\ncardholder statements with attached documentation, as required in the Acquisition TRM. d. Stamp Purchase/Receiving Procedures. Stamps may be purchased with the Government\npurchase card. The card holder who purchased the stamps will receive the stamps into TRUFACS\nprior to being sold. e. Cash Purchase Procedures. Cash purchases for Trust Fund merchandise are not authorized. f. Stores From Surplus Sources. Merchandise for resale in the Commissary must not, under\nany circumstances, be acquired through surplus channels. g. Receipt at the Institution.",

      "content": "e. Cash Purchase Procedures. Cash purchases for Trust Fund merchandise are not authorized. f. Stores From Surplus Sources. Merchandise for resale in the Commissary must not, under\nany circumstances, be acquired through surplus channels. g. Receipt at the Institution. Trust Fund merchandise received at the institution shall be\ninspected and accepted in the same manner as other institution items, except that Trust Fund\nmerchandise may be received using the TRUFACS handheld item scanner. At the institution\u2019s\ndiscretion, a substitute of a like item may be accepted. Warehouse/Trust Fund staff ensure that items are received in TRUFACS before being sold. (1) Receiving Report Preparation for Resale Items. A Receiving Report is prepared and the\ncopies distributed as applicable. If, at the time of receipt of Commissary merchandise, there is a discrepancy between the PO price\nand the invoice price, staff resolve the difference by contacting the acquisitioner. If merchandise is determined to be damaged after receipt, and before it is made available for sale, a\ncontra-Receiving Report shall be prepared. If replacement goods are later received for the\ndamaged merchandise, a Receiving Report is processed. (2) Calculation of Selling Price. The selling price of each item sold in the Commissary is\ncalculated automatically based on the cost and mark-up selected in TRUFACS. The cost of an item is established when the initial Receiving Report is generated. In the receiving\nprocess, TRUFACS establishes the selling price based on the selected mark-up automatically and\nthe cost entered. The adjustment for the updated selling price is reflected on the Inventory\nHistory Summary and Inventory Value Change Reports in TRUFACS. h. Balancing and Reconciliation of Commissary Inventory. The Trust Fund Supervisor\nensures that Commissary sales, inventory adjustments, and Receiving Reports are reconciled with\nthe Standard General Ledger monthly. Verifications are conducted when the Trust Fund extracts P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 46 are performed \u2013 these include a comparison of the TRUFACS/automated accounting system\nextract to the corresponding TRUFACS report. In addition, all Trust Fund extracts may be compared to the Inventory History Summary Report. The staff member performing the extract documents the verification of all daily extracts by signing\nthe Extract Report. The TRUFACS Extract Report is attached to the automated accounting\nsystem sub-certification report and filed. During an inventory period, if the physical inventory of a specific item reveals a difference when\ncompared to the TRUFACS Stock Status Report, an inventory adjustment may be processed. Differences identified in the inventory period must be researched before processing an inventory\nadjustment. Copies of inventory adjustments are kept in the Inventory File; the originals are filed\nin the Inventory Adjustment File. i. Inventory Limitations. The Trust Fund Supervisor maintains a fresh and adequate stock of\nmerchandise. The Supervisor makes periodic comparisons of the sales history and the minimum\nand maximum order points established in TRUFACS, and reviews order points to prevent\nunder-/overstocking. If order points are insufficient, the shelf quantity in weeks may be adjusted.",

The Supervisor makes periodic comparisons of the sales history and the minimum\nand maximum order points established in TRUFACS, and reviews order points to prevent\nunder-/overstocking. If order points are insufficient, the shelf quantity in weeks may be adjusted. To ensure that operating funds are not tied up in excessive inventory, stock limitations are set as\nfollows:\n\u25a0 Regular sales merchandise \u2013 2.0 times the monthly average sales at cost for the last two\nquarters. \u25a0 Stamp inventory \u2013 2.0 times the monthly average sales at cost for the last two quarters. The Trust Fund Supervisor ensures these limitations are not exceeded. j. Inventory Maintenance. Trust Fund staff review the Item Sales Analysis Report and items\nstocked in the Commissary routinely for those that are slow-moving or nearing expiration. Before initiating a TRUFACS Report of Survey:\n\u25a0 When possible, prepare a Contra-Receiving Report for outdated items or items damaged in\nshipment and returned to the vendor for credit, or obtain vendor credit authorization number\nfrom Central Office if prior fiscal year. If the vendor refuses to accept the merchandise for\nexchange or credit, full documentation outlining the steps taken to return it must accompany\nthe Report of Survey. If possible, a statement in writing from the vendor indicating refusal to\naccept the merchandise should be obtained.\n\u25a0 If an item cannot be sold at its original selling price, but is still sellable, offer it for sale at a\nreduced price, rather than surveying the item with no realized value. The Trust Fund\nSupervisor determines the reduced price in advance of the sale.\n\u25a0 If an item is slow moving (not sold in the last 12 months) and is determined to be sellable, the\nTrust Fund Supervisor will document the reason(s) for not returning or surveying the item. This documentation will serve as the appropriate action for not returning or surveying the item. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 47 k. Survey Procedures. When Commissary merchandise is damaged in our care, expired, unfit\nfor resale, or destroyed through an unusual cause such as fire or inmate disturbance, a Report of\nSurvey is processed per the Program Statement Property Management Manual. The Board of\nSurvey approves Reports of Survey before final disposition of the merchandise. When merchandise is lost due to theft or suspected theft, a Report of Survey is prepared per the\nProperty Management Manual except that the amount of the survey is recorded in the\nautomated accounting system as an inventory shortage. This is done in TRUFACS by selecting\nReport of Survey as the Inventory Difference Adjustment Type. TRUFACS generates the entry\nfor the automated accounting system through the extract process. If surveys for unsalable merchandise at cost exceed .0015 times the actual regular Commissary\nsemiannual sales at cost in any one inventory period, a memorandum and copies of the Reports of\nSurvey are submitted with the Trust Fund March/September Inventory Tolerance Report from the\nWarden to the Regional Director, explaining the necessity for the survey(s) and what action is\nbeing taken, if appropriate, to reduce surveys in the future.",

The Regional Trust\nFund Administrator reports any known details (type of loss, estimate of damages, actions taken)\nimmediately to the Chief, Trust Fund Branch. l. Transfer of Commissary Merchandise to Other Institutions. If the Commissary has\nexcess stock in original condition, and efforts to return the merchandise to the vendor or sell it at a\nreduced price have been exhausted, the Trust Fund Supervisor is authorized to contact other\ninstitutions to transfer the merchandise, per the Property Management Manual. Excess merchandise is offered to other institutions at a predetermined price, not to exceed 25\npercent below original cost; the gaining institution pays transportation charges. The gaining\ninstitution processes a PO. The losing institution prepares a Stores Requisition, Invoice &\nTransfer Receipt (BP-A0100), generates an inventory adjustment using adjustment type of Sales to\nthe Institution, and processes an IPAC charge to the gaining institution and enters it into the\nautomated accounting system. A copy of the BP-A0100 is the supporting document and is\nattached to the TRUFACS inventory adjustments identified above. m. Transfer of Commissary Merchandise Within the Institution.

TRUFACS Inventory Adjustments are signed by the Trust Fund\nSupervisor. o. Inventory Preparation. Any time during the month of March and during the month of\nSeptember an itemized physical inventory of merchandise in the Commissary is performed. The\nCommissary may close for the time needed to reconcile the inventory. The inventory must be done no later than the close of business on the second to the last workday of\nthe second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year. The inventory is used to document the\nsemi-annual automated accounting system inventory entry, which is sub-certified in the automated\naccounting system on the last workday of each inventory period by Trust Fund Branch staff. The centralized inventory extract reflects all inventories as of midnight the previous day. A final\nStock Status Report is generated in TRUFACS on the last workday of the inventory period, before\nany inventory transactions take place. The Stock Status is recorded as \u201cFinal Semi-Annual\u201d and\nkept in the inventory file.",

Conducting the Physical Inventory. Ordinarily, OFM staff make the official count of\nCommissary inventory (merchandise and stamps) using the TRUFACS handheld scanner for\nmerchandise, and the Manual Inventory Worksheet for stamps. The inventory is reconciled to\nensure the accuracy of the physical count. The inventory is counted by two different individuals or teams. One individual or team is\ndesignated the Official Inventory Team and shall exclude staff who were assigned to conduct\nCommissary sales, who did maintain TRUFACS inventory during the two quarters, who did take\npart in the Official Inventory Team count during the previous inventory, and who fell under the\nsupervision of the Trust Fund Supervisor. The Trust Fund Supervisor designates the second\nindividual or team to conduct a count to be compared to the official count or to help with the\nreconciliation. Inmates do not participate in any way during the physical inventory, but may\norganize stock before the inventory. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 49 The following steps are taken when conducting an inventory:\n\u25a0 Count items in all areas where Commissary merchandise is located (main institution, camp,\nspecial housing unit, stamp inventory, etc.).\n\u25a0 After merchandise is inventoried, upload the physical counts in TRUFACS, which calculates\nthe variance for each item counted or not counted. Conduct recounts until no items appear on\nthe Physical Inventory Variance Count Report. \u25a0 Reconcile differences between the two inventory counts and between the final count and the\nsystem count. Following reconciliation, only members of the Official Inventory Team sign\nthe Items Count Report, the Manual Inventory Worksheet for stamps, and the \u201cfinal\u201d Stock\nStatus Report. \u25a0 Produce a final Stock Status Report after completing the inventory. \u25a0 Upon completing the physical inventory, file the signed Manual Inventory Worksheet for\nstamps, Items Count Report, end of inventory period inventory adjustments, and final Stock\nStatus Report in the inventory file. q. Semi-Annual Inventory Accounting Requirements. The Trust Fund Supervisor ensures\nthe final Inventory Adjustment Extract is sub-certified in the automated accounting system before\nthe end of the accounting period. r. Semi-Annual Reporting Requirements. The Inventory Tolerance Report is reviewed by the\nRegional Trust Fund Administrator the month following the semi-annual inventory. Regional Office staff review the report for excessive inventory differences and to ensure\ninstitutions remain within acceptable tolerance levels.

TRUFACS assigns each Deposit Fund transaction a unique internal control number, U.S. Treasury\npayment number, cash sub-voucher number, debt number, and/or transaction receipt numbers. Source documents are grouped and processed by transaction type or reference number. The staff\nmember posting an income or withdrawal JV assigns the JV number before posting. A total\namount for each transaction type and/or reference/payment number is determined for control\npurposes. This total is compared to the total transaction listing from TRUFACS to ensure the proper\namount(s) have been posted. Each payroll type is assigned an individual JV number. Debt\nnumbers assigned by TRUFACS are in the following format: YXXXD001 (Y is current fiscal\nyear, XXX is the institution\u2019s alpha code initializing the debt, D is the identifier for a debt, and 001\nis the numerical counter). When funds are collected by the TRUFACS automated process, an\nAutomated Debt Payment Report and JV prints with the TRUFACS assigned debt reference\nnumber. After each transaction is totaled and verified, extracts are performed for the specific document(s)\nprocessed. Supporting documentation is forwarded to the Certifying Officer or Approving\nOfficial as appropriate for certification. Local procedures are established for control and\nverification of data processed and uploaded into the automated accounting system from\nTRUFACS. The time frames for performing extracts are as follows:\nExtract Type Extract Requirements Commissary Sales Extract Daily. Inmate Outside Payment Extract BP-199 \u2013 immediately after processing;\nRelease \u2013 U.S. Treasury Checks \u2013 after the\ninmate has departed from the institution;\nDebt Payments \u2013 immediately after\nnotification that payment is ready (Automatic P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 68 Inmate Release Card Certification Screen Debt Payment Report). Daily. Inventory Adjustment Extract Immediately upon completion of the\nadjustment. TRUFONE Withdrawal Extract Daily. JV Extract Daily/Weekly/Monthly at institution\u2019s\ndiscretion. Outside Income Extract When the balance equals or exceeds $5,000 or\nweekly (on Thursday). Purchase Order Extract Upon completion of the Procurement Process. Use to establish the obligation (when\navailable). Reimbursement Voucher Extract Weekly. Inmates who have not yet left the\ninstitution at the time of the extract shall not be\nincluded. TRULINCS Withdrawal Extract Daily. When a posting error is discovered, the transaction is voided and re-entered using the exact\nreference number used in the original entry, with the exception of negotiable instruments posted\nlocally. Correcting entries for locally posted negotiable instruments requires the original receipt\nnumber with a prefix of \u201c9\u201d as the reference number. Voiding entries removes and replaces the\nincorrect transaction from the extract file if the correction was made before extracting the\ntransaction(s).",

Note: A voiding entry for a U.S. Treasury payment transaction removes the original record from\nthe extract file if the extract was not performed before processing the voiding transaction. U.S.\nTreasury payment transactions containing errors are deleted in the automated accounting system\nbefore disbursement, or through PACER after disbursement.

Inmates are instructed to use TRULINCS to view their\naccount balance and transactions or to use the Inmate Telephone System to access their account\nbalance. Although inmates are allowed to make inquiries concerning their account transactions\nas prescribed locally, institutions are not required to provide TRUFACS receipts to inmates for\nwithdrawals and income transactions. c. Accounting for TRUFACS Deposit Fund Transactions. TRUFACS generates JVs as\nrequired along with automated accounting entries for transactions that affect inmate funds. The\nonly exceptions are transactions requiring an accounts receivable entry or requiring corresponding\nentries affecting the Salaries and Expenses Appropriation. 8.5 MANAGEMENT OF INMATE ACCOUNTS WITH NEGATIVE BALANCES Documentation relating to creation of a negative inmate account balance is scanned and attached\nto the transaction that created the negative balance. Scanned documentation includes a\nmemorandum from the Trust Fund Supervisor notifying the Warden of the negative balance,\nexplaining events leading to the negative balance, and identifying corrective steps. A negative\nbalance created as a result of a LockBox correcting entry does not require Warden notification. Trust Fund Branch Deposit Fund staff provide supporting documentation in cases of LockBox\nerrors/entries resulting in negative account balances. Upon TRUFACS transfer of a negative balance, the gaining institution receives the negative\nbalance with the inmate account record and images of all scanned documents for reference. The\nTrust Fund Supervisor, or the staff member responsible for oversight of Deposit Fund activities,\nreviews the images related to the inmate\u2019s account balance to determine if the documentation\nexplains the negative balance. See Section 8.1.b if a negative balance is a result of a staff error. If the negative balance is not the\nresult of staff error, only the above-referenced memorandum to the Warden is necessary while the\ninmate is in custody.",

The Warden, or\nauthorized representative, provides in writing a determination whether the funds are considered\nconfiscated funds or credited to an inmate\u2019s account. Confiscated funds are deposited immediately to Miscellaneous Receipts Account \u2013 Forfeitures of\nUnclaimed Money (151060). P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type.

If the\ninmate dies with monies due from the United States, payment is not authorized except to a legal\nrepresentative of the estate or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution of the state of\ndomicile (most recent legal residence). a. Claims for Funds of Deceased Inmates. Claims received against funds of deceased inmates\nare handled at the institution level per 4 GAO 3500. Institutions should submit claims to the Trust\nFund Branch Deposit Fund Section for GAO settlement only when doubt exists as to:\n\u25a0 The amount or validity of the claim. \u25a0 The person(s) properly entitled to payment under the laws of the domicile of the descendent.

If there is urgent need for payment of a balance under $100 in a deceased inmate\u2019s account, and if\nconditions as outlined in the paragraph above are satisfied, the amount may be disbursed from\nTRUFACS with the Trust Fund Branch Chief\u2019s written approval. Copies of the BP-A0408 are\nattached to such vouchers in lieu of the usual withdrawal request. Documentation is attached to\nthe payment in TRUFACS through the document imaging process. b. Unclaimed Funds of Deceased Inmates. Procedures for processing \u201cwhereabouts\nunknown\u201d inmates are followed when disposing unclaimed funds of deceased inmates with no\nrelatives or claimants for the funds. 8.8 ENCUMBRANCE OF INMATE FUNDS Encumbrance of inmate funds for various reasons is essential. Careful consideration is given\nbefore any action; encumbrances are not made indiscriminately.

The original memorandum is forwarded to the Trust Fund Specialist, who establishes the\nencumbrance. The memorandum is imaged in TRUFACS and assigned to the encumbered\nrecord. Upon the inmate\u2019s transfer, the gaining institution has access to the comments and document\nimage associated with the encumbrance. b. Funds Received Locally from Unauthorized Correspondent. If funds from unauthorized\ncorrespondents are received and opened inadvertently by Mail Room staff, they are returned to the\nsender using a Stamps, Negotiable Instrument & Other Returned to Sender form (BP-A0328). A\ncopy of the form is forwarded to the inmate and to the inmate\u2019s central file. If the sender\u2019s name\nand address cannot be established, the funds are disposed of as follows:\n(1) Checks.

Claims for funds deposited six or more years ago into whereabouts unknown are not processed or\ndisbursed. Management of funds for inmates identified whereabouts unknown are managed by\nthe Trust Fund Branch Deposit Fund Section. a. Processing Activities for Whereabouts Unknown Accounts\n(1) Local Processing. Each institution determines the current or last known location of any\ninmate who has funds on a TRUFACS account but has been released. Management of the\ninmate\u2019s remaining balance is conducted as described below. Inmates in SENTRY as Prolonged-In-Transit for 120 days automatically have their TRUFACS\naccount status changed to SENTRY Release. When an inmate account changes to SENTRY\nRelease status because it has reached 120 days of Prolonged-In-Transit in SENTRY, research is\ndone to find the inmate\u2019s current location and an attempt(s) made to disburse the funds. Attempt(s) to locate the inmate are documented in the comments field of the TRUFACS Inmate\nRelease Screen. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 73 If an earnest attempt to locate the inmate fails, the account balance is processed through the\nTRUFACS Release Screen by selecting the release type of Transfer Whereabouts UNK. (A sort\ncode of WUNK Transfer Out is automatically assigned to the account). When the release type \u201cTransfer Whereabouts UNK\u201d is used, the inmate\u2019s status changes to\nReleased, and the account transfers from the institution to the Trust Fund Branch Deposit Fund\nSection \u201cWhereabouts Unknown Funds Received Account,\u201d pending disposition.

Endorsed or Mutilated Checks. Endorsed or mutilated checks are not included on a\nschedule of canceled checks. The U.S. Treasury examines the facts relating to each endorsed\ncheck that has been returned after negotiation by the payee. This is required to protect the rights\nof the endorser, who may be holder in due course. Also, the Treasury examines the facts relating to mutilated checks; such checks must be in their\npossession to issue new ones to the payee or claimants. Consequently, a separate schedule is prepared for endorsed or mutilated checks showing the\nnumber and amount on each and indicating the action to be taken. In each case, the U.S. Treasury\ngives the administrative office a disposition of each undeliverable check returned.",

Any correspondence pertinent to this matter should be directed to the joint\npayee involved.\u201d Distinctions should be made between joint-payee checks that require the endorsement of only one\npayee to negotiate and those that require the endorsement of all joint payees. For example, checks\nwritten payable to \u201cJohn or Mary Doe\u201d and \u201cJohn and/or Mary Doe\u201d require only the endorsement\nof the inmate. This type of check is handled in the same manner as any other check after the\ninmate has endorsed it. Checks written payable to \u201cJohn and Mary Doe\u201d require endorsement of\nboth parties to negotiate and are handled as joint-payee checks. c. Returned Checks. If a check posted to an inmate\u2019s account is returned by the U.S. Treasury\non a debit voucher or notification of credit advice from the LockBox for insufficient funds (NSF),\nthe amount of the returned check plus any service charges incurred is removed from the inmate\u2019s\naccount immediately.

If the funds are required as evidence in a case, they are not accepted. (2) Other Than Evidence Funds. If a claim exists on the funds other than as evidence, such as\nfor theft, embezzlement, etc., the funds are received in the usual manner. The receipt issued bears\nthe provision \u201cUnavailable Pending Determination of Legal Ownership.\u201d The funds are\ndeposited into the U.S. Treasury Miscellaneous Receipts Account pending a determination. e. Insurance, Trust, and All Other Similar Settlement Checks. Endorsement and deposit of\ninsurance, trust, and similar checks are generally considered as acceptance of settlement. Whenever such negotiable instruments are received locally, they are held in the Mail Room and\nthe Unit Manager notified. When received through the LockBox, the check is forwarded to the\nTrust Fund Branch Deposit Fund Section, where it is logged into the check register and forwarded\nto the institution Business Administrator/Trust Fund Supervisor to be processed by the discipline\nresponsible for Deposit Fund activity.",

Withdrawals initiated by inmates and requiring a staff signature for approval\nare made using a Request for Withdrawal of Inmate\u2019s Personal Funds (BP-199), or a Withdrawal\nRecord \u2013 Inmate (BP-201). These requests are completed in TRULINCS or legibly in ink and signed by the inmate in the\npresence of Unit Management staff, then hand-delivered by the staff member to the approving\nofficial, who signs the form and hand-delivers it to the Trust Fund Specialist or secured Trust Fund\ndesignated area. Before processing withdrawals, the Trust Fund Specialist verifies that the forms have been\naccurately completed and signed. Forms not accurately completed and signed are voided and\nreturned to the inmate. In addition, the Trust Fund Specialist annotates the voucher number and\nstaff\u2019s initials. The Trust Fund Specialist and Certifying Officer are both responsible for ensuring\nthat the approval process has been completed before BP-199s are processed. b. Funds Availability. Approved withdrawal requests are subject to availability of funds. Withdrawal requests are processed for payment from the Inmate Deposit Fund (15X6085). Withdrawal transactions in TRUFACS generate an immediate verification of the inmate\u2019s account\nbalance before completing the transaction. Depending on the withdrawal type selected,\nTRUFACS creates a debt automatically, allows the inmate\u2019s account to go into a negative balance,\nor records a zero non-sufficient funds (NSF) tracking transaction if the amount of the transaction\nexceeds the balance in the inmate\u2019s account. Refer to the specific transaction to determine the\naction initiated by TRUFACS. c. Processing Time. Requests for Withdrawal of Inmate\u2019s Personal Funds (BP-199) are\nprocessed and scheduled at least once a week. d. Repeating Monthly Withdrawals. Inmates requiring repeating monthly withdrawals\nindicate the begin date and end date on the Request for Withdrawal of Inmate\u2019s Personal Funds\n(BP-199). A subsequent request to stop a monthly withdrawal is made by the Inmate in\nTRULINCS or on an Request to Staff Member only when TRULINCS is not available. Requests\nfor repeating withdrawals are scanned; the scanned copy of the BP-199 serves as the original\nrequest each month. If the inmate is unable to make a monthly withdrawal because of NSF, the status of the monthly\nwithdrawal request is set to inactive and must be resubmitted by the inmate. If this type of\nwithdrawal request exceeds the available funds, a zero dollar NSF tracking transaction is\ngenerated. These withdrawals do not allow creation of a negative account balance or a debt. e. Processing Withdrawals to Foreign Countries. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),\nTitle 31, Part 211, restricts check delivery to certain addresses outside the United States, its\nterritories, and possessions. Upon receiving a request for withdrawal in favor of a payee in a\nforeign country, the Business Administrator/Trust Fund Supervisor reviews 31 CFR, Part 211, to\ndetermine whether the withdrawal can be effected. If so, the withdrawal is at the Business\nP4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 89 Administrator/Trust Fund Supervisor\u2019s discretion and is certified appropriate for payment.

If,\nafter reviewing the regulation, there is any question concerning payment, it is referred to the Chief,\nTrust Fund Branch. f. Cash Payments. Effective October 1, 2001, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3321-3333 required Federal\nagencies to eliminate imprest funds except where cash payments were required by law. The Bureau is required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624 to provide inmates cash gratuities at release. In\naddition, cash payments are allowable based on a waiver to the U.S.C. in 31 CFR \u00a7 208 for\ntransportation expenses and personal funds for releases, furloughs, escorted trips, furlough\ntransfers, and emergency furloughs for the purpose of bedside visits or funeral attendance. When cash payments are made for escorted trips, furloughs, furlough transfers, emergency\nfurloughs, and releases, TRUFACS generates a Reimbursement Voucher Extract, Reimbursement\nSub-Voucher Report, and transaction listings. The original document(s) are forwarded to the\nCashier to support the Reimbursement Voucher. 10.5 SPECIFIC PROCESSING OF INMATE WITHDRAWALS\na. Inmate-Initiated Withdrawals to Outside Entities. These include withdrawals requested\nin favor of individuals or organizations outside the institution. Examples include: Bills, Books,\nLaw Books, Child Support, Court Fees, Donations, Education Materials, Gifts, Legal Fees,\nOutside Savings, Subscriptions, Support, Tithes, and Tuition. This type of withdrawal is made in\nfavor of the payee and initiated on receipt of a signed, written request using a Request for\nWithdrawal of Inmate\u2019s Personal Funds (BP-199) or Withdrawal Record \u2013 Inmate (BP-201). The\noriginal BP-199 or BP-201 is attached to the TRUFACS Outside Payment Report and the\nSub-Certification Report received for the inmate funds withdrawn and scheduled for U.S.\nTreasury check payments. If an inmate lacks sufficient funds to allow a BP-199 or BP-201 to be processed, the Trust Fund\nSpecialist stamps it \u201cNon-Sufficient Funds,\u201d notes in the margin the amount of funds in the\naccount, and returns it to the inmate. If this type of withdrawal request exceeds the inmate\u2019s available funds, a zero dollar NSF tracking\ntransaction is generated. These withdrawals do not allow the creation of a negative account\nbalance or a debt. b. Inmate-Initiated Withdrawals to the United States. These include withdrawals requested\nin favor of the United States. Examples include: escorted trip settlements, COIF, Damage to\nGovernment Property, DHO Sanction, TRUFONE Reports, PAC Replacement, institution charges\nfor telephone calls, copies, postage, and urinalysis fees. A signed Request for Withdrawal of Inmate\u2019s Personal Funds (BP-199)/Withdrawal Record \u2013\nInmate (BP-201) is the source document and is drawn in favor of the Treasurer of the United States\nP4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 90 for the transactions listed above. Since this type of BP-199 is processed manually, inmates are\nnot required to complete the bubble section of the form. If the inmate has NSF to process the\nwithdrawal, TRUFACS prompts the staff to create a debt and the BP-199 is scanned into\nTRUFACS. The debt\u2019s creation assigns a debt number automatically, and encumbers funds until\nthe total owed the government is satisfied.",

When the debt is satisfied, a JV is processed and the\nappropriate accounting entries forwarded to the JV extract section for upload to the automated\naccounting system. c. Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) Withdrawals. In accordance with the PLRA, 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e, inmates may be assessed certain fees for filing lawsuits. The source document\nfor these withdrawals is the court order. No inmate signature is required to process these\nwithdrawal types. PLRA documents are scanned into TRUFACS. PLRA withdrawals are processed using the Misc Inmate Debt Maintenance Screen in TRUFACS. These withdrawals do not allow creation of a negative account balance. The source document is\nattached to the TRUFACS Outside Payment Report and the Sub-Certification Report received for\nthe inmate funds withdrawn and scheduled for U.S. Treasury check payment. d. Transfer of Funds Between Inmates\n(1) Transfers of Funds Between Inmates at Same Institution. Funds may be transferred\nfrom the account of one inmate to another when the inmates are close relatives and the Warden\napproves in writing. The Request for Withdrawal of Inmate\u2019s Personal Funds (BP-199) shall be\ncompleted legibly in ink and signed in the presence of Unit Management staff. The source\ndocuments are the approval memorandum from the Warden authorizing the transfer between\ninmates and the signed BP-199. The Warden\u2019s memorandum is scanned into TRUFACS If this type of withdrawal request exceeds the inmate\u2019s available funds, a zero dollar NSF tracking\ntransaction is not generated. These withdrawals do not allow creation of a negative account\nbalance or a debt. (2) Transfers of Funds Between Inmates at Different Bureau Institutions. When the\ntransfer of funds involves inmates in separate institutions, it is necessary to obtain both Wardens\u2019\nprior written approval. Once both have been obtained, the inmate transferring the funds signs the\nRequest for Withdrawal of Inmate\u2019s Personal Funds (BP-199) for the amount to be transferred. The institution withdrawing the funds uses the special TRUFACS \u201cTransfer Between Institutions\u201d\nfunction. This transfers the funds to the receiving inmate at the other institution automatically. TRUFACS generates the appropriate reference number and accounting entries, which are\nuploaded to the automated accounting system by Trust Fund Branch staff. The source documents for these withdrawals are the approval memorandums from the Wardens\nand the signed BP-199. The Wardens\u2019 memorandums are scanned into TRUFACS. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type.

All funds with the exception of gratuities and\ntransportation are paid utilizing inmate release card. h. Inmate Releases \u2013 Release Card Unavailable. Unit Management staff furnish the\nrecommended amounts for gratuities to be paid in cash before release so that the Prisoner\u2019s\nPersonal Funds and Cash Gratuities Voucher (BP-A0112) may be ready for signature when the\ninmate is discharged. Inmate Systems Management furnishes the Accounting Technician a list of\ninmates to be released. Cash disbursements related to releases are listed on the BP-A0112 and\nsigned by a Certifying Officer as approved before the payment is made. The inmate signs the\nvoucher when the funds are received. If an after-hours release is conducted, the control room officer signs the cashier\u2019s copy of the\nBP-A0112, taking responsibility for the funds. The Control Room Officer obtains the inmate\u2019s\nsignature on the original BP-A0112 when the release funds are given to the inmate, and the form is\nreturned to the cashier the next business day. Payments from the imprest fund may not exceed $500 for any one transaction, except that\nunlimited cash may be provided:\n\u25a0 For the personal funds of individuals being deported as illegal immigrants.\n\u25a0 For the personal funds of unsentenced inmates upon their release from custody. \u25a0 From personal funds of individuals authorized emergency furloughs for bedside visits or\nfuneral attendance. The limits above are the maximum amounts allowable for payment by the Cashier. Institutions\nmay establish lesser amounts for cash payment, with the balance being forwarded promptly by\ncheck. Inmates, upon release, are entitled to receive their personal funds in their Inmate Deposit Fund\nAccount. Upon release, inmate personal funds to be paid in cash are held to a minimum. Release payment computations include accrued institution earnings, by providing the inmate with\nP4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 92 an Advance Pay for payroll that has not been processed. Payments made to the inmate upon\nrelease are in the form of cash up to $500; the remaining balance is disbursed via a U.S. Treasury\ncheck, except where noted below. (1) Cash Payment of Inmate Personal Funds. Payment is made from a Prisoner\u2019s Personal\nFunds and Cash Gratuities Voucher (BP-A0112) generated in TRUFACS. Withdrawals from\ninmates\u2019 accounts are processed before the authorized Certifying Officer\u2019s signature on the\nBP-A0112. (Payments do not include funds for negotiable instruments on hold.) Staff processing the release assign the next available release number for each group of releases.

(2) Schedule of U.S. Treasury Check Payment of Personal Funds to Be Sent to Destination\nUpon Release. The portion of the release payment to be paid by a U.S. Treasury check is\nscheduled for payment when the release is processed in TRUFACS. This payment is made to\narrive at the inmate\u2019s release destination. U.S. Treasury checks are always issued in the inmate\u2019s\ncommitted name so, when cashed, they are prima facie evidence of payment. i. Gratuities and Transportation. Inmates recommitted as parole or conditional release\nviolators are again provided with suitable clothing, transportation, and gratuity on release. (1) Gratuities. A cash gratuity, not to exceed $500, may be paid to each inmate on release. The amount is determined per the Program Statement Release Gratuities, Transportation, and\nClothing. Release to Contract Residential Re-Entry Centers (RRC). Inmates accepted for release to a\ncontract RRC with inadequate funds, as determined by Unit Management staff, may be eligible for\na gratuity. Release to Other Custody. If an inmate is being released to another law enforcement agency\nand in all probability will be released promptly, the inmate may be paid a gratuity. (2) Transportation. Transportation is furnished to an inmate upon release, to their place of\nresidence within the United States, place of conviction, or another destination approved by the\nWarden. When the inmate obtains their own transportation home, no transportation cost is\nauthorized. Transportation Requests. Transportation furnished to released inmates may be procured by the\nauthorized travel management center\u2019s Government Transportation Accounts (GTA). The most\neconomical means of transportation is used. Transportation may be furnished for travel to airport,\ntrain, or bus terminals, and may also be furnished by relatives. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 93 Cash Payments. Transportation furnished to releasing inmates may be purchased or paid for in\ncash, not to exceed $100 including tax (excludes taxis) and within imprest fund capability. The normal procedure provides for tickets in advance. If cash is given to purchase tickets, the\namount is entered in the release screen under transportation and included in the total paid\ntransportation column of the Prisoner\u2019s Personal Funds and Cash Gratuities Voucher (BP-A0112). Arrangements may be made with the authorized travel management center to have the ticket at the\nterminal for the inmate. The authorized agency charges the ticket to the institution\u2019s GTA. j. Special Circumstances. (1) Immediate Releases After Normal Business Hours. Institutions establish procedures\ndetailing the return to duty of essential staff who can make transportation arrangements and\nprovide funds for inmates being released at the direction of the courts to comply with release\norders. (2) Immediate Release of Inmates Awaiting Trial. Inmates awaiting or held during trial and\nreleased immediately may be paid with an inmate release card, regardless of the amount. (3) Out to Court/Writ.",

(3) Out to Court/Writ. When an inmate leaves an institution under court order and is not\nexpected to return, the inmate is paid the balance remaining in their personal account. A\nreasonable amount may be paid in cash and the balance as appropriate. When inmates are\nreleased on \u201cwrit\u201d and held in a state or county correctional institution for more than 120 days,\ntheir account balance is paid via U.S. Treasury check. If the inmate submits a written request\nprior to 120 days, the available balance will be forwarded via U.S. Treasury check. (4) Deportees. Deportees may be paid the full amount of their personal funds with an inmate\nrelease card. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provides illegal immigrants released to\ntheir custody with transportation to their residence. Gratuities are provided per the Program\nStatement Release Gratuities, Transportation, and Clothing. k. Correction of Administrative Errors. Withdrawals processed to correct administrative\nerrors are processed per Chapter 8.1 and do not require an inmate\u2019s signature. TRUFACS places\nthe account into a negative balance when sufficient funds are unavailable when processing such\nwithdrawals. l. Phone Withdrawals. Phone withdrawals are initiated by inmates using the Inmate\nTelephone System and their PAC. Phone withdrawal attempts that fail due to lack of funds do not\ncreate a debt and do not generate a zero dollar transaction. There is no source document for these\ntransactions. The appropriate accounting entries are forwarded to the phone withdrawals extract\nsection for upload to the automated accounting system. m. TRULINCS Withdrawals. TRULINCS withdrawals are initiated by inmates using\nTRULINCS workstations. TRULINCS withdrawal attempts that fail due to lack of funds do not\nP4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 94 create a debt and do not generate a zero dollar transaction. There is no source document for these\ntransactions. The appropriate accounting entries are forwarded to the TRULINCS withdrawals\nextract section for upload to the automated accounting system. n. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Tax Liens. IRS Tax Liens are covered under Sections\n6321, 6331, and 6334 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and court orders. Funds on deposit\nin the Bureau Deposit Fund are subject to tax lien and levy. The source document for this type of\nwithdrawal is an IRS order. o. Furloughs and Emergency Furloughs. In no instance can appropriated funds be used to\npay furlough costs when the inmate is furloughed for self purposes (see the Program Statement\nInmate Furloughs). A properly completed Request for Withdrawal of Inmate\u2019s Personal Funds\n(BP-199) is the source document for furloughs. TRUFACS places the inmate account into a negative balance when funds are insufficient to\nprocess emergency furlough withdrawals. Staff allow a negative balance to be created only when\nthe Warden has determined that the furlough is an emergency, as defined in the Program Statement\nInmate Furloughs. Refer to Chapter 8.5 for processing negative account balances. p. Furlough Transfers. Central Office appropriated funds may be given to an inmate for meals\nand transportation for a furlough transfer.",

Inmates are not allowed to have personal funds withdrawn for furlough\ntransfers. Personal funds are transferred during the nightly process. q. Escorted Visits. Costs for these visits are at the inmate\u2019s expense, except for the escorting\nstaff member\u2019s first eight hours cost of pay each day the inmate is in his/her custody. The first\neight hours may be regular time or overtime. Any amount paid the escorting Officer after the first\neight hours is collected from the inmate. A Travel Authorization is carried by the escorting staff\nto support the trip\u2019s official nature, as well as support travel duty status on time and attendance\nrecords. The inmate completes two Requests for Withdrawal of Inmate\u2019s Personal Funds (BP-199). The\nfirst BP-199 totals the trip\u2019s estimated costs, including estimates of the escorting staff\u2019s salary\nchargeable to the inmate, and any other miscellaneous costs that may be reimbursed to the\nGovernment per Federal Travel Regulations and Bureau policy.

The BP-199 is attached to the transaction report, and forwarded to the cashier for\ncash payment. The Accounting Technician/Cashier makes a cash payment based on the BP-199; the inmate signs\nthe payees signature line on the BP-199 showing receipt of payment. The withdrawal is sent to\nthe Reimbursement Voucher Extract, to be extracted upon preparation of the next reimbursement. The BP-199 associated with costs reimbursed to the Government is encumbered using the\nMiscellaneous Encumbrance Entry function in TRUFACS. The BP-199 is secured until the\ntravel is complete and a travel voucher submitted. The escorted trip\u2019s total cost is settled using a travel voucher. Expenditures by the escorting staff\nare accounted for as required under Federal Travel Regulations and Bureau policies.

PROCESSING INMATE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM\n(IFRP) PAYMENTS\n11.1 GENERAL This chapter establishes procedures for processing automated and manual payments in TRUFACS\nfor IFRP through SENTRY. IFRP was developed to encourage sentenced inmates to satisfy\ncourt-ordered financial obligation(s). Inmates receive help from Unit Management staff to\ndevelop a financial plan to satisfy these obligation(s). The SENTRY IFRP Module facilitates processing procedures for payments made on behalf of\ninmates who have court-ordered financial obligation(s). It allows tracking of financial data\nentered into the SENTRY database. TRUFACS automates IFRP withdrawals, SENTRY\ntransmission, and processing of the Business Disbursements and Excess Withdrawal transactions. Unit Management staff enter the appropriate data into SENTRY for all inmates with a financial\nobligation. The stored information is updated monthly or quarterly after OFM/Trust Fund staff\nprocess payments, or when the inmate changes participation status, or as necessary for a change in\na financial obligation. The Trust Fund Branch transmits the payment data and funds to the\nappropriate component. 11.2 OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY The Chief, Trust Fund Branch, has oversight of IFRP payments and ensures that the IFRP data\ntransmitted to outside components is accurate and timely. If errors are detected in the data or\nIPAC amounts each institution processes, Deposit Fund staff contact the institution and request\ncorrective action. After reconciliation, the Trust Fund Branch transfers the funds to the appropriate component(s),\nauthorizes SENTRY to release the IFRP data file to the component, and generates reports. Each\ninstitution ensures the accuracy of data they process and promptly corrects errors identified by\nDeposit Fund staff. 11.3 ACRONYMS AND SENTRY IFRP TERMINOLOGY\na. Financial Obligation. Any court-ordered payment for restitutions, fines, assessments, child\nsupport, etc.\nb. Plan.

The automated function in SENTRY that establishes the cut-off for processing\ncontracts during the current cycle period. The cut-off date is automated by SENTRY and is the\nlast day of each month. f. Transaction Code. The four-digit code used to access various SENTRY screens. g. Excess Withdrawal. The amount by which an expected withdrawal exceeds the financial\nobligation balance. h. Business Disbursement. The amount of an inmate\u2019s financial obligation for which a U.S.\nTreasury payment is required. During the IFRP process, on day three, business disbursements are\nre-posted automatically to the inmate account; a TRUFACS outside payment extract is generated\nfor OFM/Trust Fund staff to sub-certify and upload to the automated accounting system. 11.4 SENTRY INPUT\nUnit Management staff enter inmate obligation data and generate a SENTRY IFRP contract. The\ncontract includes the payment terms agreed upon and is signed by the inmate. This form is filed\nin the inmate central file in accordance with the Program Statements Inmate Central File,\nPrivacy Folder, and Parole Mini-Files and Inmate Financial Responsibility Program. 11.5 MONTHLY CUT-OFF\nOFM/Trust Fund staff process two payment cycle types each month (UNICOR and Inmate\nPerformance Pay), if appropriate. No later than the 15th of each month, these cycle types are\ncompleted and the funds transmitted via IPAC to the Deposit Fund, Trust Fund Branch, Agency\nLocation Code 15-10-0903. 11.6 SENTRY IFRP PAYMENT PROCESSING The IFRP is processed in TRUFACS and SENTRY on the same day the associated pay (UNICOR\nor Inmate Performance Pay) is posted. Single and monthly payments are processed each month,\nand quarterly payments are processed only during the last month of each quarter. Payments of\nless than $25 are not made unless they are final payments. The SENTRY transaction codes for the following procedures are explained in the SENTRY\nInmate Financial Responsibility Technical Reference Manual.\na. SENTRY Changes Applied to TRUFACS. SENTRY updates TRUFACS when one of the\nfollowing occurs:\n\u25a0 Unit Management staff creates or stops an IFRP contact. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 99 \u25a0 Unit Management staff changes an inmate\u2019s participation status; e.g., FRP Refuse, temp\nexempt.\n\u25a0 The balance of an obligation falls below $25 and the contract is for repetitive Inmate\nPerformance Pay withdrawals. When this occurs, SENTRY stops the repetitive withdrawal\nand issues a second Trust Fund change for the final payment. If, in the next cycle following\nthe creation of this single final payment withdrawal, the inmate has insufficient funds to cover\nthe balance, SENTRY allows a second chance to complete the obligation by generating a\nsecond single final payment. Trust Fund changes, and active contracts generated in SENTRY, are updated in TRUFACS on the\nfirst day of each month. Contracts entered into SENTRY by Unit Management staff and received\nas part of the nightly process are considered valid.",

P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 109 a. F.O.B. Destination. When merchandise is shipped F.O.B. destination, the vendor pays\nshipping charges with no additional charge to the Government. b. F.O.B. Shipping Point. When merchandise is shipped F.O.B. shipping point, the\nGovernment pays the cost of transportation from the vendor\u2019s dock to the final destination. c. Receiving Reports. If the shipment is on a GBL, the GBL number, gross weight of the\nshipment, and transportation cost as revealed by the freight bill, freight receipt, etc., are entered on\nthe Receiving Report. Shipments on a commercial collect Bill of Lading are converted to a GBL. When the Government pays for transportation that is prepaid by the vendor, costs are billed as\nseparate item(s) on the invoices. This estimate or actual cost for transportation charges is shown\non the Receiving Report. 12.6 GOVERNMENT BILL OF LADING\na. Incoming Deliveries. The GBL (SF-1103) does not require completion by the consignee. It\nis not expected that a detailed examination is made of each shipment before signing the carrier\u2019s\ndelivery document. However, when cursory inspection at delivery indicates possible shortage,\nloss, or damage, the carrier\u2019s representative is requested to make a notation to that effect on the\ndelivery ticket and the consignee\u2019s copy of the GBL. If shortage, loss, or damage is discovered later, the carrier is notified immediately by telephone,\nfollowed by a written confirmation. The carrier is requested to inspect damage, breakage,\ncontamination, loss, etc., and furnish the consignee with a copy of the report. Pending inspection\nby the carrier or designated agent, the damaged articles, containers, and packing material are kept\nintact. b. Outgoing Shipments. When a GBL is needed for outgoing shipments, Warehouse/Trust\nFund staff prepare the GBL and provide the carrier with the following copies:\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\n\u25a0 Original (SF-1103). Shipping Order (SF-1104). Freight Waybill - Original (SF-1105). Freight Waybill \u2013 Carrier\u2019s Copy (SF-1106). The remaining copies (SF-1103A) are distributed as follows:\n\u25a0 1 copy to consignee\u2019s accounting station for obligation. \u25a0 1 copy to consignee\u2019s receiving department. \u25a0 1 copy for GBL numerical file (located in procurement). c. Lost GBLs. The original GBL is the carrier\u2019s primary shipping document, which is used to\nbill the Government for transportation. If, upon delivery, the original GBL cannot be located, the\nP4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 110 carrier may, after certification by the issuing office, use the Freight Waybill - Original (SF-1105)\nas a substitute when submitting public vouchers to the Government paying office.

F.O.B. Shipping Point. Property purchased F.O.B. shipping point becomes the property of\nthe Government upon delivery. If a shipment is damaged, one of the following procedures is\nrequired: If the property can be repaired, arrangements can sometimes be made for the carrier to contract\nwith a local repair shop. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 111 The institution may contract for the repairs or may make the repairs in the institution. The actual\ncost of restoring the article to its original condition is the amount required from the carrier in\nsatisfaction of the damages. If repair is impractical, the damaged article may, with the carrier\u2019s consent, be disposed of as\nsalvage. The replacement cost or original cost, including transportation in either case, is the\namount of damages to be recovered. When a shipment is received on an F.O.B. shipping point basis and is completely or partially\ndamaged, the Receiving Report shows items accepted; the damaged items are listed separately\nwith corresponding values of the merchandise. The damaged items are be covered by a Report of\nSurvey, which is used for posting to the Stock Record Card.\nb. F.O.B. Destination. If the damaged articles were the property of the vendor while in transit\n(e.g. F.O.B. destination), the Government\u2019s remedies against the carrier are limited. If the goods\nwere rejected and left in the carrier\u2019s possession, or were received and held at the institution, it is\nimportant that prompt notice of the damage and rejections be given to the vendor. Arrangements\nmay be made for a replacement shipment and to permit the vendor to make whatever claim the\nvendor has against the carrier and to authorize disposition of the damaged goods.",

Local procedures are established to identify contaminated\nclothing and linen and for sending them to the laundry. c. Hazardous Chemicals. Calcium Hypochlorite (bleach) is not used in granular form because\nof its explosive potential. Authorized staff may dispense liquid bleach. d. Clothes Soiled With Flammable Materials. Special care shall be taken to ensure that\nclothes soiled with flammable materials (e.g., grease, gasoline, oil) are washed and dried\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. e. Inmate Training. Each inmate assigned to the laundry receives training from the Laundry\nSupervisor concerning safe working conditions and use of equipment per manufacturers\u2019\nrecommendations. Particular attention shall be given to training inmates on proper clothes drying\nprocedures. 13.5 LAUNDRY SECURITY\na. Laundry Area. At a minimum, inmate workers entering or leaving the laundry area are\npat-searched daily. Occasional strip searches are conducted per the Program Statement Searches\nof Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas. A staff member inspects trash leaving\nthe area. Boxes and cartons are broken down. The laundry area is inspected daily for potential\nhazards and contraband. No more inmates than staff can manage and control effectively are permitted to work in the\nLaundry. Inmates never work without staff supervision, and are never locked in the Laundry\nwithout a staff member present. b. Key Security. Laundry keys are considered \u201crestricted\u201d keys and are only issued to\ndesignated staff. The Trust Fund Supervisor and employees assigned to the Laundry may have\nkeys to the Laundry and storage areas on a 24-hour checkout basis. Employees not directly\nassigned to the Laundry or storeroom do not have keys to these areas. If an institution experiences repeated pilferage or unauthorized access to the laundry area, the\nfollowing procedures are followed. A special wood/metal box(s) with a glass front, large enough\nto contain the entire Laundry key ring(s) (or an individual Laundry key ring) is constructed and P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 123 placed in the control room. At the end of each work day, the Laundry ring(s) are securely locked\nin this box. A key may be checked out on a 24-hour basis to designated employees assigned to the\nLaundry, and the Trust Fund Supervisor. In an emergency, the glass may be broken. After such an incident, a memorandum is sent to the\nTrust Fund Supervisor documenting the situation that required emergency key access and noting\nany item(s) removed from the laundry. c. Clothing Retrieval. As needed, the Trust Fund Supervisor requests that Correctional\nServices staff perform an institution shakedown to retrieve unauthorized Government-issued\nitems. d. Laundry Fires. Any fires located in the Laundry area will be reported by the staff working in\nthe Laundry through the Trust Fund Supervisor to the Chief, Trust Fund Branch as soon as\npractical. 13.6 LAUNDRY FIRE SAFETY It has been determined there are three general causes for Laundry fires.",

Any fires located in the Laundry area will be reported by the staff working in\nthe Laundry through the Trust Fund Supervisor to the Chief, Trust Fund Branch as soon as\npractical. 13.6 LAUNDRY FIRE SAFETY It has been determined there are three general causes for Laundry fires. They are:\n\u25a0 Spontaneous ignition \u2013 laundry items not thoroughly cleaned, dried, and processed (removing\nitems from the dryer, sorting, folding, and distributing) has led to spontaneous ignition. \u25a0 Unsupervised dryer operations \u2013 dryers have been left in operation after staff have left the\nworksite for the day. \u25a0 Lack of proper maintenance and cleaning of laundry equipment, particularly dryers, dryer lint\ntraps, and dryer vents. To minimize the potential for fires involving laundry operations:\n\u25a0 Manufacturers\u2019 guidelines/instructions on the use of institutional washers and dryers shall be\nposted for staff and inmates to review. \u25a0 Staff and inmates must ensure adherence to manufacturers\u2019 guidelines/instructions on the use\nof institutional washers and dryers. \u25a0 Staff must ensure equipment manufacturers\u2019 load limits are not exceeded for washers and\ndryers.\n\u25a0 Do not launder or dry any rags, towels, mop heads, etc., that appear to be contaminated with\nsolvents, oils, or other potentially hazardous material until a waste determination has been\nconducted and an approval has been granted by the institution\u2019s Safety and Environmental\nCompliance Administrator.\n\u25a0 The laundry drying process must be completed early enough in the day/shift to allow at least\none hour prior to the end of the day/shift to appropriately process laundered items. \uf0d8 Use of dryer cooling cycle is mandatory. \uf0d8 Under no circumstances will laundry remain in a dryer at the end of the shift. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type.

In\nmost cases the clothing is still damp in the center of the bag, which is where the greatest\namount of heat is found. Bags of clothing that are not completely dry have a greater potential\nfor spontaneous ignition.\n\u25a0 If laundry bags are used, limit the amount/weight of clothing items laundered in the bags to\nprovide a better opportunity for cleaning and drying of all the items in the bag. Linens,\npillows, and blankets will not be placed in laundry bags. Laundry bags should be secured at\nthe top of the bag so the items in the bag are not compacted, allowing water and air to flow\nfreely throughout the bag. \u25a0 Laundry carts used in the drying process shall be fire-resistant. \u25a0 Laundry equipment should be evaluated to ensure an adequate number of machines, in the\nappropriate sizes, are available to meet industrial laundry specifications.

TRUST FUND LIMITED INMATE COMPUTER SYSTEM\n14.1 GENERAL The Trust Fund Limited Inmate Computer System (TRULINCS) provides inmates with a\ncomputer system that does not jeopardize the safety, security, orderly operation of the correctional\nfacility, or the protection of the public or staff. Inmates do not have access to the Internet. TRULINCS is the property of the United States Department of Justice. The Department may\nmonitor any activity on the system and search and retrieve any information stored within the\nsystem. By accessing and using this system, inmates consent to such monitoring and information\nretrieval for law enforcement and other purposes. Inmates have no expectation of privacy as to\nany communication on or information stored within the system. 14.2 AUTHORITY The Warden shall prohibit or discontinue the operation of TRULINCS, or individual inmates\u2019\nparticipation, whenever it is determined to jeopardize the safety, security, or orderly operation of\nthe correctional facility, or the protection of the public and staff. Use of TRULINCS is a privilege; therefore, the Warden may limit or deny the privilege of a\nparticular inmate (see Section 14.9 for restrictions). This authority may not be delegated below\nthe Associate Warden level. Individual inmates may be excluded from program participation or individual services as part of\nclassification procedures (see Section 14.9). Information supporting the exclusion is forwarded\nto the Warden for final determination. 14.3 RESPONSIBILITIES a. TRULINCS Coordinator. The Chief of the Trust Fund Branch is the designated\nTRULINCS Coordinator \u2212 the resource person for Bureau staff, other components of the\nDepartment of Justice, law enforcement agencies, and the general public. b. Trust Fund Supervisor. The Trust Fund Supervisor has responsibility for the overall\noperation of TRULINCS at the institution. The Trust Fund Supervisor administers, maintains,\nand monitors the system; provides training to inmates during Admission and Orientation;\nsupervises inmate workers assigned to the TRULINCS detail; and responds to inmate inquiries\nregarding the system. The Trust Fund Supervisor is also the designated System Supervisor and maintains internal\ncontrols, system integrity, user accounts, and all other aspects of TRULINCS security and\noperations. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 126 c. Staff Use. Staff members may not use TRULINCS for personal use. d. Contacts and Inmates. By participating in the TRULINCS Program, inmates, and the\ncontact(s) with whom they correspond, voluntarily consent to having all system activity, including\nemail and transactional data, monitored and retained by authorized personnel. This authority\nincludes rejecting individual emails sent to or from inmates that jeopardize the interests identified\nin Section 14.2. (1) An inmate\u2019s participation in the TRULINCS Program is conditioned on his/her notice,\nacknowledgment, and voluntary consent to the Warden\u2019s authority, as indicated above.",

Inmates\nconsent to monitoring when they accept the TRULINCS Electronic Messaging Warning/\nResponsibility/Acknowledgment Statement each time they access the system.\n(2) A community person\u2019s consent to Bureau staff monitoring of all TRULINCS emails and\nactivity is obtained when he/she receives the initial system-generated email notifying him/her the\ninmate wants to add him/her to their contact list and when he/she proceeds with corresponding. 14.4 RATES The Chief of the Trust Fund Branch, with the concurrence of the Assistant Director of the\nAdministration Division, sets all program fees. By participating in the program, the inmate\nconsents to have the Bureau withdraw program fees directly from his/her Deposit Fund account. 14.5 EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES Requests for additional equipment or alternative locations are forwarded from the Warden through\nthe Regional Trust Fund Administrator to the Chief of the Trust Fund Branch for consideration. a. Equipment. Inmate computers and printers must clearly display a blue label as \u201cINMATE\nACCESS.\u201d\nb. Multi-Purpose Workstations. Ordinarily, workstations are located in the housing units and\nlaw library. Workstations located in the housing units ordinarily are multi-purpose, offering\nvarious services, with the exception of the Electronic Law Library and print services. c. Electronic Law Library (ELL) Workstations. TRULINCS ELL workstations located in\nthe institution Law Library ordinarily offer access to only the ELL Service and limited supporting\nservices (e.g., TRU-Unit Management and Bulletin Board services). TRULINCS ELL\nworkstations are located in the Law Library due to the sensitivity of information and supervision\nwithin the area. d. Print Workstations. Ordinarily each institution will have two print stations available on the\nmain compound and one in a satellite camp. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 127 e. Operating Supplies. Funds are provided in the annual TRULINCS budget to purchase\noperating supplies (e.g., paper, toner, mailing labels). Procedures for procuring these items are in\nChapter 2. 14.6 TRULINCS INMATE WORKERS Inmates receive compensation from the Trust Fund Appropriation for work performed in support\nof TRULINCS. Relatively short absences due to callouts, hospitalization, sick line, etc., do not\naffect the period covered. Extended absences such as furloughs, lay-in assignments, or\nlockdowns are not compensable. a. Screening of Inmate Workers. Inmates who refuse to participate in the Inmate Financial\nResponsibility Program may not work in TRULINCS. Prior to assigning inmates to the detail, the\nTrust Fund Supervisor shall request the Special Investigative Supervisor (SIS) to determine if any\nissues exist that raise security concerns (e.g., ongoing investigation). b. Work Hours. Ordinarily, TRULINCS inmate work details do not exceed four hours per day. c. Rate of Pay. The hourly rate of pay for inmates assigned to TRULINCS activities is:\n$0.55 per hour starting\n$0.75 per hour after 3 months\u2019 service, if warranted\nAny increase in pay (not to exceed $0.75 per hour) is based on the inmate\u2019s work performance and\navailability of funds provided in the annual budget. d.

Bonus Pay. Bonus Pay may be awarded to TRULINCS inmate workers. It may not exceed\none-half of the inmate\u2019s monthly pay. A bonus recommendation is made by the work assignment\nsupervisor. e. Restrictions on Inmate Duties. TRULINCS equipment should be secured adequately to\nprevent inmates from accessing the internal components of computers or peripherals. If inmates\nare used to clean secured equipment (e.g., workstations, printers), they must be directly supervised\nby staff at all times to prevent theft, damage, or misuse, until the equipment is secured. 14.7 ACCOUNTING\na. Daily Reconciliation. The Trust Fund Specialist compares the TRUFACS Withdrawal\nReport total (TRUFACS Withdrawal Type = TRUL Withdrawal) with the TRULINCS\nReconciliation with TRUFACS Report daily. The Trust Fund Specialist verifies that these\nbalances are equal. If they differ, the Trust Fund Specialist contacts the Central Office Trust Fund\nBranch Deposit Fund immediately. Upon verification of the balances, the Trust Fund Specialist\nuploads the daily TRULINCS extract to the automated accounting system. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 128 b. Monthly Reconciliation. Staff complete the monthly reconciliation as required in the\ninstitution proof-check. c. Refunds. Refunds are provided in the following circumstances:\n\u25a0 When granted by the Trust Fund Supervisor as a result of a system malfunction that has been\ndocumented through the trouble ticket system. \u25a0 Refunds for printer malfunctions, in the form of a reprint unless documented through the\ntrouble ticket system.\n\u25a0 When granted by the Central Office when purchased media has been deemed defective,\nexplicit, or inappropriate. d. Funds Returned to TRUFACS. Funds are returned to TRUFACS by staff only in the\nfollowing circumstances:\n\u25a0 Inmates are released. \u25a0 Inmates on Public Messaging and/or MP3/Music restriction for more than 60 days may request\nin writing that their TRU-Units be returned to their Commissary account. This is a one-time\ntransaction for the entire TRU-Unit balance.\n\u25a0 In rare or unusual instances deemed appropriate by the Warden when inmates do not have\naccess to TRULINCS. In these circumstances, Trust Fund staff are given written\ndocumentation to support the transfer. This is a one-time transaction for the entire balance. e. Processing Inmate Releases. A TRULINCS account is released when an inmate is released\nin TRUFACS. If there is a communication issue between TRUFACS and TRULINCS, staff may\nproceed with the release in TRUFACS. A secondary TRUFACS release must be completed once\nconnection with TRULINCS is restored. The Trust Fund Specialist shall run the TRULINCS\nReleased Inmate with TRU-Unit Balance Report weekly and take corrective action for inmates\nlisted on this report. 14.8 INMATE ACCOUNTS. TRULINCS inmate accounts are established and maintained\nautomatically through the TRUFACS nightly process. a. Account Access. Inmates access their accounts using their eight-digit register number;\nnine-digit phone access code (PAC); and fingerprint identification or four-digit Commissary\npersonal identification number (PIN).

It is the inmate\u2019s responsibility to maintain possession of his/her login information. Inmates will\nnot share passwords (login criteria) and will log off the system when leaving the TRULINCS\nterminal. b. Locked Accounts. After three consecutive failed attempts to access the system, the inmate\u2019s\naccount is locked. Inmates request in writing to the Trust Fund Supervisor that their accounts be\nunlocked. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 129 14.9 SYSTEM ACCESS It is important that staff ensure inmates are only restricted from using TRULINCS, or individual\nTRULINCS services, when absolutely necessary to protect the safety, security, or orderly\noperation of the correctional facility, or the protection of the public or staff. Due to the \u201cself-service\u201d format TRULINCS provides, all inmates who are physically capable of\naccessing a TRULINCS terminal should be provided access in all but limited cases. Public\nMessaging is the only exception to this approach, as it involves communication with persons in the\ncommunity and the possibility of continuing criminal or other prohibited activity that may\njeopardize the safety and security of the institution. a. Program/Service Exclusions. Inmates excluded from participation under this section are\nnotified of the specific reason(s) by a written explanation of the decision, unless possessing such\nwritten information would threaten the safety of the inmate or other legitimate penological\ninterest(s). If prohibited from possessing a copy of the written explanation, inmates remain\nentitled under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to access this information from their central\nfiles, and must be provided reasonable opportunities to access and review such documents. At the\ninmate\u2019s request, expense, and preparation of an envelope, staff may photocopy and mail the\ndocuments. An inmate\u2019s exclusion from participation must be based on his/her individual history of behavior\nthat could jeopardize the legitimate penological interests listed above. Inmates must not be\nexcluded from participation based on general categorizations of previous conduct. (1) Sex Offenders. Inmates whose offense, conduct, or other personal history indicates a\npropensity to offend through the use of email, or jeopardizes the safety, security, orderly operation\nof the correctional facility, or the protection of the public or staff, should be seriously considered\nfor restriction. As a method of identifying these inmates, staff responsible for local sex offender management\nshould review inmates with SENTRY CMA Walsh Assignments of Certified, With Conviction,\nand No Conviction, to determine if their participation in the Public Messaging Service poses a\nrealistic threat. TRULINCS automatically applies a temporary restriction on inmates\u2019 accounts\nwith the above SENTRY CMA Walsh Assignments. These restrictions may be over-written\nwhen deemed appropriate by staff responsible for local sex offender management and approved by\nthe Warden. Inmates may be permanently restricted from corresponding and/or communicating with\nindividuals who are:\n\u25a0 Prior child or adult victims of sexual offenses committed by the inmate.

(2) Secure Units. The Warden may determine which services shall be available to inmates\nhoused in areas of the institution in which there are special security concerns that limit regular\naccess. Special consideration should be given to the type of services being made available in\nthese areas. No services with text input/retention fields (e.g., Contact List Service) shall be\navailable as inmates may use the system to communicate indirectly with other inmates. At a minimum, workstations located in secure units shall provide access to the following services:\n(a) Law Library \u2212 per the Program Statement Inmate Legal Activities, the Warden shall provide\nan inmate confined in disciplinary segregation or administrative detention a means to access legal\nmaterials. (b) Purchase TRU-Units \u2212 to facilitate charging for printing of law library content, when\napplicable. (c) Print \u2212 to facilitate printing of law library content, when applicable. (d) Request to Staff \u2212 for reporting of allegations of sexual abuse and harassment directly to the\nOffice of Inspector General (OIG). The Request to Staff Service will not be made available to\ninmates located in Protective Custody Units (PCU). Inmates housed in secure units will request access to the TRULINCS workstation per local\nprocedures. (3) Segregation. Inmates confined in segregation will not have access to the Public Messaging\nService. Inmates may continue to receive incoming emails while in segregation. Staff are not\nresponsible for printing emails for inmates without access to the Public Messaging Service. (4) Protective Custody. Inmates confined in Protective Custody Units (PCU) will not have\naccess to the Public Messaging Service. (5) Communication Management Units. Inmates confined in communication management\nunits will have access to the Public Messaging Service. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 131 b. Restrictions\n(1) Inmate Discipline/Criminal Prosecution. Inmate use of the program in violation of the\nprocedures subjects the inmate to disciplinary action or criminal prosecution. In addition,\ninmates who abuse, circumvent, or tamper with TRULINCS (equipment, application, furniture)\nare subject to disciplinary action or criminal prosecution. The DHO or UDC may impose the\nsanction of loss of Public Messaging or Music/Media privileges for inmates found guilty of\ncommitting prohibited acts. Note: Inmates are only restricted from accessing the Music Service during the designated period\nof time. There is no effect on the MP3 player; therefore, it will continue to operate until it expires. (2) Pending Investigation or Disciplinary Action for TRULINCS Abuse or Misuse. If an\ninmate is pending either investigation or disciplinary action for possible abuse or misuse, a partial\nor total restriction is authorized by the Warden.",

A restriction in this situation is discretionary to\nensure the institution\u2019s safety, security, and orderly operation, or the protection of the public and\nstaff. When deemed necessary, ordinarily the SIS office recommends this type of restriction. Any TRULINCS restriction recommended by the SIS office may only be imposed with the\nWarden\u2019s approval, in accordance with the procedures outlined in this section and documented on\nform BP-A0740, Request for Inmate Telephone or TRULINCS Restriction. Initial Public Messaging restrictions, imposed pending an investigation or pending disciplinary\naction for possible TRULINCS abuse or misuse, are limited to 30 days. If additional 30-day\nperiods are required to complete either the investigation or disciplinary process, the Warden must\nre-authorize the restriction in writing on form BP-A0740, Request for Inmate Telephone or\nTRULINCS Restriction. Trust Fund staff shall obtain the Warden\u2019s approval for reinstatement or\ncontinued restrictions every 30 days. 14.10 TRULINCS SERVICES a. Account Transactions. Inmates are responsible for tracking their Commissary, TRUFONE,\nand TRULINCS account balances. Inmates have access to view account information and\ntransactions for free. Inmates have the ability to print transactional information for a fee. Inmates that have access to the Account Transactions Service are responsible for printing their\nown account statements. In rare and unusual circumstances when an inmate demonstrates an\nimminent need for an account statement and he/she does not have access to TRULINCS, staff may\nprint the statement and charge the inmate the applicable print fee. Staff prepare the statement and\ndeliver it to the inmate in a secure manner within a reasonable timeframe from the date of the\nrequest and at a time that does not interfere with the normal operations of the institution. b. Bulletin Board. TRULINCS offers an electronic bulletin board for posting information for\nviewing by the inmate population. Departments that opt to use this service are responsible for\nposting their own documents and the documents\u2019 content. P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type. 132 All postings must be in PDF format and may not exceed 2 MB in size. c. Contact List. Inmates may only communicate with approved persons on their contact lists\nfor the purpose of postal mail, TRUFONE, Public Messaging, and/or any person to whom they\nwant to send funds. It is the inmate\u2019s responsibility to maintain his/her own list with accurate contact information, to\ninclude first name; last name; relationship; language; and postal address. Inmates are subject to\ndisciplinary action for lying and/or providing false or fictitious information regarding a contact\n(e.g., when complete name is not used; when information is altered to hide the identity of the\ncontact; and any/all other attempts to mislead reviewing and monitoring staff as to the true identity\nand contact information). Ordinarily, inmates are limited to having 100 active contacts on their contact list. Staff are not responsible for printing contact lists for inmates in SHU.",
