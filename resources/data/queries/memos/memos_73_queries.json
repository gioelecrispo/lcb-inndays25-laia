It m ust also be clearly understood that\nsuch volunteers expect no governm ental com pensation. Federal agencies ordinarily may not accept voluntary services or other donations in the absence of\nexpress statutory authority, and volunteers should not in any case be used on a broad scale or to\naccom plish tasks ordinarily perform ed by paid governm ent em ployees. February 25, 1982\nM EM O RA N D U M OPINION FO R THE COUNSEL TO TH E PRESIDENT\nM em bers of your staff have asked us for advice concerning the employment\nstatus of persons who volunteer to assist a federal advisory committee. We have\nbeen given m aterials describing the President\u2019s Task Force on Private Sector\nInitiatives (Task Force), an advisory com mittee created by Executive Order No.\n12329, 46 Fed. Reg. 50919 (1981), and we have been asked to comment\nspecifically on the propriety of accepting certain donations and voluntary serv\u00ad\nices in this context. We conclude that, subject to the specific limitations described\nbelow, voluntary services of consultants and other donations may be accepted by\nthe governm ent to assist this advisory com m ittee. Background\nThe Task Force was established in accordance with the provisions of the\nFederal Advisory Committee A ct, as amended (5 U .S .C . App. I), to advise the\nPresident and the Secretary o f Commerce concerning methods of promoting\nprivate sector activities designed to meet public needs, and to serve as a focal\npoint for such private sector initiatives. See Exec. O rder No. 12329, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. The m em bership of the Task Force consists of both private citizens and public\nofficials from the federal, state, and local governments. Id. at \u00a7 1. M embers of\nthe Task Force serve without com pensation, but the government may pay their\nexpenses pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5701-5707. Id. at \u00a7 3(b). The Departm ent of\nCom m erce is responsible for providing the Task Force with \u201c such administrative\n160 services, funds, facilities, staff, and other support services as may be necessary\nfor the effective performance of its functions.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 3(c).1 In addition to staff provided by the Department of Com m erce,2 the Task Force\nwould be \u201c loaned\u201d personnel from various corporations or other private en\u00ad\ntities,3 and it would receive donations and loans of equipment from such private\nsources. 4 One corporation also has proposed to contribute the salary of another\nTask Force employee by donating money to a charitable organization5 that would\ncompensate the \u201c em ployee\u201d directly for his services to the Task Force.

The Federal Advisory Committee Act provides that the\nD irector of the O ffice o f M anagem ent and B udget (OM B) shall establish\nguidelines with respect to rates of pay for services of members, staffs, and\nconsultants o f advisory com m ittees. 5 U .S .C . App. I, \u00a7 7(d). The O M B\nguidelines address the question of voluntary services as follows: The provisions of this section [dealing with pay for members,\nstaff and consultants] shall not prevent an agency from accepting\nthe voluntary services of a member of an advisory comm ittee, or a\nm ember of the staff of an advisory com m ittee, provided that the\nagency has authority to accept such services without compensa\u00ad\ntion. OMB Circular No. A -6 3 , \u00a7 11(d) at A -9 (1974). As a general matter, federal agencies do not have the authority to accept\nvoluntary services. In fact, C ongress has expressly provided in the A ntiDeficiency Act that \u201c [n]o officer or employee of the United States shall accept\nvoluntary service for the United States . . . except in cases of emergency\ninvolving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\u201d 31 U .S.C .\n\u00a7 665(b) (1976). In addition, employees may not waive a salary for which\nCongress has set a minimum. See, e.g., Glavey v. United States, 182 U .S. 595\n(1901). 1 Travel and support services, o f co u rse, may be provided only to the extent otherw ise authorized by law, and\nsubject to the availability of funds.

See, e.g., Glavey, supra. W hether this principle is expressed as a\nm atter of personnel management or unauthorized augmentation of appropria\u00ad\ntions, it has always been interpreted to limit the situations in which services may\nbe accepted. 8 T here are, however, discrete situations w here Congress has not set minimum\nsalaries for em ployees. For exam ple, there is no minimum salary set for persons\nem ployed as consultants pursuant to 5 U .S .C . \u00a7 3109.9 Although consultants\nmay not be em ployed to perform \u201c governmental functions,\u201d and their services\nm ust be interm ittent o r temporary and limited to tasks of a purely advisory\nnature, it seem s likely to us that some of the Task Force staff positions would fit\nthis d escrip tio n .10 To the extent that individuals serving the Task Force work as\nconsultants, they may do so on a volunteer basis, so long as it is clear that they\nexpect no governm ental compensation. We understand that the Commerce D e\u00ad\npartm ent will require each \u201c consultant volunteer\u201d to execute a written waiver of\ncom pensation, which should be sufficient to protect the government from subse\u00ad\nquent salary claim s.

See, e.g.. Interim Report, supra at 2 3 -9 . The express prohibition in\n\u00a7 665(b) on the acceptance of voluntary services admittedly has caused some\nuncertainty about the propriety of uncompensated government service when such\nservice is not expressly authorized by statute.\" Although there is no express\nstatutory authorization for volunteer consultants to the Task Force, we are\ncomfortable with the position that the absence of a minimum salary level, and the\nnature of consultant services, make the use of volunteer consultants acceptable in\nthis context. We must advise caution, however, against the use of volunteers on a\nbroad scale or to accomplish tasks ordinarily performed by paid government\nem ployees. 12\n(2)\nConflict of Interest. Having determined that it is appropriate as a general\nmatter for the Com merce Department to accept volunteer consultants to serve the\nTask Force, we next must determine the extent to which the conflict of interest\nstatutes and agency conduct regulations will apply to these volunteers. The\nFederal Personnel Manual (FPM), Ch. 735, App. C (1969), sets forth the\nprinciples for determ ining whether persons serving the government on a tem po\u00ad\nrary or intermittent basis are subject to the conflict of interest laws. Briefly, the\nFPM distinguishes between (1) persons \u201c whose advice is obtained by an agency\n. . . because of [their] individual qualifications and who serve . . . in an inde\u00ad\npendent capacity\u201d and (2) persons who are asked \u201c to present the views of a non\u00ad\ngovernmental organization^] or group[s] which [they] represent, or for which\n[they are] in a position to speak.\u201d FPM , App. C at p. C\u20144. The former category of\nindependent experts is deemed to be subject to the conflict of interest laws\nbecause their service to the government is expected to be impartial, and free from\noutside influence or control. The latter category of private representatives, on the\nother hand, is not subject to the conflict of interest laws because it is expected that\nsuch persons would be influenced by the private groups that they have been\nchosen to represent. 13\nM For a discussion o f statutes w hich expressly authorize governm ent em ploym ent w ithout co m p en satio n , see\nInterim Report, supra at 120.

Given our understanding\nof the Task Force and the role o f the consultant volunteers, we would be inclined\nto place the volunteers in the category of the staff employees who are fully subject\nto the conflict of interest law s. We reach this conclusion based upon our\nunderstanding that the volunteers will be performing impartial professional\nservices for the Task Force. 14\nO ne conflict of interest issue will be especially significant to the Task Force\nvolunteers. As Com m erce Departm ent em ployees, the volunteers will be subject\nto rules governing outside compensation and gifts. While government employees\nserving without compensation are not prohibited by 18 U .S .C . \u00a7 209 from\naccepting a salary from an outside source, they should not accept anything of\nvalue (including a salary) under circum stances that will create, or appear to\ncreate, a conflict o f interest. T he Commerce Departm ent Standards of Conduct\nprohibit em ployees from soliciting or accepting any compensation or other thing\nof value from a person who:\n(1) H as, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or\nfinancial relations with the D epartm ent of Commerce;\n(2) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by the\nD epartm ent of Commerce; or\n(3) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the\nperform ance o r nonperformance of the em ployee\u2019s official duty or\nby actions o f the Department. 15 C .F.R . \u00a7 0 .7 3 5 -1 1(a).

Equipment The Secretary of Commerce has been given authority by Congress to accept\ngifts of property for the purpose of aiding or facilitating the work of that\nDepartment. See 15 U .S .C . \u00a7 1522. In order to implement this authority, the\nSecretary has issued an Administrative Order (D A O -203-9), dated July 30,\n1965, governing the acceptance of gifts and bequests by the D epartm ent.16 We\nunderstand that the anticipated donation of supplies and equipment to the Task\nForce will b e processed by the Commerce Department pursuant to this order. You\nshould be aware that the order provides that gifts shall not be accepted unless they\nmeet specific conditions, which include the following:\n[the gift] would not involve in substance, or have the appearance\nof involving, personal benefit to an employee for or in con\u00ad\ntemplation of services to the donor. Its acceptance would not tend to result in public misunderstanding\nconcerning the ability of any Department employee to carry out\nhis official duties in a fair, independent, impartial, or objective\nmanner. Its acceptance would not compromise or appear to compromise\nthe honesty and integrity of departmental programs or of its\nemployees and their official actions or decisions. Administrative Order at p. 2. We would interpret these conditions to suggest that\nthe Com m erce D epartm ent direct the same kind of attention to the identity of\ndonors as we described previously with regard to the volunteers. 17 Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that it would be appropriate for\nthe Com m erce Department to accept \u201c volunteer\u201d consultants to assist the Task\nForce.
