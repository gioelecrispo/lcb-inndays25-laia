Individual members of Congress, including ranking minority members, do not have the\nauthority to conduct oversight in the absence of a specific delegation by a full house,\ncommittee, or subcommittee. They may request information from the Executive\nBranch, which may respond at its discretion, but such requests do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a\nsubpoena or contempt proceedings. May 1, 2017 LETTER OPINION FOR THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT We understand that questions have been raised about the authority of\nindividual members of Congress to conduct oversight of the Executive\nBranch. As briefly explained below, the constitutional authority to conduct oversight\u2014that is, the authority to make official inquiries into and to\nconduct investigations of executive branch programs and activities\u2014may\nbe exercised only by each house of Congress or, under existing delegations, by committees and subcommittees (or their chairmen). Individual\nmembers of Congress, including ranking minority members, do not have\nthe authority to conduct oversight in the absence of a specific delegation\nby a full house, committee, or subcommittee. Accordingly, the Executive\nBranch\u2019s longstanding policy has been to engage in the established process for accommodating congressional requests for information only when\nthose requests come from a committee, subcommittee, or chairman authorized to conduct oversight. The Constitution vests \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers\u201d in \u201ca Congress of the\nUnited States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1. The Supreme Court has recognized that one\nof those legislative powers is the implicit authority of each house of\nCongress to gather information in aid of its legislative function. See\nMcGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 174 (1927). Each house may exercise its authority directly\u2014for example, by passing a resolution of inquiry\nseeking information from the Executive Branch. See 4 Deschler\u2019s Precedents of the United States House of Representatives, ch. 15, \u00a7 2, at 30\u201350\n1 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 41 (1981) (describing the practice of resolutions of inquiry and providing\nexamples); Floyd M. Riddick & Alan S. Frumin, Riddick\u2019s Senate Procedure, S. Doc. No. 101-28, at 882 (1992) (\u201cThe Senate itself could investigate or hear witnesses as it has on rare occasions[.]\u201d). In modern practice, however, each house typically conducts oversight\n\u201cthrough delegations of authority to its committees, which act either\nthrough requests by the committee chairman, speaking on behalf of the\ncommittee, or through some other action by the committee itself.\u201d Application of Privacy Act Congressional-Disclosure Exception to Disclosures\nto Ranking Minority Members, 25 Op.

As\nthe Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[t]he theory of a committee inquiry is\nthat the committee members are serving as the representatives of the\nparent assembly in collecting information for a legislative purpose\u201d and,\nin such circumstances, \u201ccommittees and subcommittees, sometimes one\nCongressman, are endowed with the full power of the Congress to compel\ntestimony.\u201d Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 200\u201301 (1957). By contrast, individual members, including ranking minority members,\n\u201cgenerally do not act on behalf of congressional committees.\u201d Application\nof Privacy Act, 25 Op. O.L.C. at 289; see also id. at 289\u201390 (concluding\nthat \u201cthe Privacy Act\u2019s congressional-disclosure exception does not generally apply to disclosures to ranking minority members,\u201d because ranking\nminority members \u201care not authorized to make committee requests, act as\nthe official recipient of information for a committee, or otherwise act on\nbehalf of a committee\u201d). Under existing congressional rules, those members have not been \u201cendowed with the full power of the Congress\u201d (Watkins, 354 U.S. at 201) to conduct oversight. See Congressional Oversight\nManual at 65; see also Exxon Corp. v. FTC, 589 F.2d 582, 593 (D.C. Cir.\n1978) (\u201c[D]isclosure of information can only be compelled by authority\nof Congress, its committees or subcommittees, not solely by individual\nmembers; and only for investigations and congressional activities.\u201d). Individual members who have not been authorized to conduct oversight\nare entitled to no more than \u201cthe voluntary cooperation of agency officials\nor private persons.\u201d Congressional Oversight Manual at 65 (emphasis\nadded). The foregoing reflects the fundamental distinction between constitutionally authorized oversight and other congressional requests for infor2 Authority of Individual Members of Congress to Conduct Oversight mation. When a committee, subcommittee, or chairman exercising delegated oversight authority asks for information from the Executive Branch,\nthat request triggers the \u201cimplicit constitutional mandate to seek optimal\naccommodation . . . of the needs of the conflicting branches.\u201d United\nStates v. AT&T Co., 567 F.2d 121, 127 (D.C. Cir. 1977); see also id. at\n130\u201331 (describing the \u201c[n]egotiation between the two branches\u201d as \u201ca\ndynamic process affirmatively furthering the constitutional scheme\u201d). Such oversight requests are enforceable by the issuance of a subpoena and\nthe potential for contempt-of-Congress proceedings. See McGrain, 273\nU.S. at 174; 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 192, 194; see also Standing Rules of the Senate,\nRule XXVI(1), S. Doc. No. 113-18, at 31 (2013) (empowering all standing committees to issue subpoenas); Rules of the House of Representatives, 115th Cong., Rule XI, cl. 2(m)(1) (2017) (same). Upon receipt of\na properly authorized oversight request, the Executive Branch\u2019s longstanding policy has been to engage in the accommodation process by\nsupplying the requested information \u201cto the fullest extent consistent with\nthe constitutional and statutory obligations of the Executive Branch.\u201d Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies from\nPresident Ronald Reagan, Re: Procedures Governing Responses to Congressional Requests for Information (Nov. 4, 1982).",

But a letter or inquiry\nfrom a member or members of Congress not authorized to conduct oversight is not properly considered an \u201coversight\u201d request. See Congressional\nOversight Manual at 56 (\u201cIndividual Members, Members not on a committee of jurisdiction, or minority Members of a jurisdictional committee,\nmay, like any person, request agency records. When they do, however,\nthey are not acting pursuant to Congress\u2019s constitutional authority to\nconduct oversight and investigations.\u201d). It does not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and is not legally enforceable\nthrough a subpoena or contempt proceedings. Members who are not committee or subcommittee chairmen sometimes\nseek information about executive branch programs or activities, whether\nfor legislation, constituent service, or other legitimate purposes (such as\nSenators\u2019 role in providing advice and consent for presidential appointments) in the absence of delegated oversight authority. In those nonoversight contexts, the Executive Branch has historically exercised its\ndiscretion in determining whether and how to respond, following a general policy of providing only documents and information that are already\npublic or would be available to the public through the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. Whether it is appropriate to respond to\n3 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 41 requests from individual members will depend on the circumstances. In\ngeneral, agencies have provided information only when doing so would\nnot be overly burdensome and would not interfere with their ability to\nrespond in a timely manner to duly authorized oversight requests. In many\ninstances, such discretionary responses furnish the agency with an opportunity to correct misperceptions or inaccurate factual statements that are\nthe basis for a request. CURTIS E.
