      "content": "Application of Conflict of Interest Rules to Appointees\nWho Have Not Begun Service\nConflict of interest rules first apply when an appointee begins the duties of his office. May 8, 2002 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL\nOFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS You have asked for our opinion whether the principal conflict of interest rules\nof the Executive Branch apply to a person who has been appointed to an office by\nthe President with the advice and consent of the Senate but has not yet begun the\nduties of that office. 1 We determine that the conflict of interest rules do not apply\nby virtue of the appointment alone but instead apply only after the appointee has\nbegun the duties of his office. I.\nThe principal conflict of interest restrictions that govern the Executive Branch\nare found in the criminal conflict of interest laws, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 202-209 (2000);\nthe directives in Executive Order No. 12674, Principles of Ethical Conduct for\nGovernment Officers and Employees, 3 C.F.R. 215 (1989); and the Standards of\nEthical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 5 C.F.R. pt. 2635 (2002)\n(\u201cStandards of Ethical Conduct\u201d). In each case, the reach of the restrictions\ndepends on the meaning of the terms \u201cofficer\u201d and \u201cemployee.\u201d By their terms, the potentially relevant criminal statutes cover \u201cofficers\u201d and\n\u201cemployees.\u201d For example, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(a)(1)(B) forbids, among other things,\na person\u2019s receipt of compensation for certain representational services rendered\n\u201cat a time when such person is an officer or employee . . . in the executive . . .\nbranch of the government.\u201d Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(a), \u201c[w]hoever, being an\nofficer or employee of the United States in the executive . . . branch of the\nGovernment\u201d acts as an agent or attorney for anyone before an agency or court is\nguilty of a crime. And 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 209(a) bars receipt of a salary or supplement to\na salary \u201cas compensation for . . . services as an officer or employee of the\nexecutive branch of the United States Government.\u201d Because title 18 sets out no definition of \u201cofficer\u201d or \u201cemployee,\u201d we have\nlooked to the definitions in title 5 as \u201c\u2018the most obvious source of a definition\u2019 for\ntitle 18 purposes.\u201d Applicability of Executive Order No. 12674 to Personnel of\n1\nLetter for M.

Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2104 (2000), an\n\u201cofficer\u201d is defined to mean someone who is (1) \u201crequired by law to be appointed\nin the civil service by [the President, a court of the United States, the head of an\nExecutive agency, or the Secretary of a military department] acting in an official\ncapacity,\u201d (2) \u201cengaged in the performance of a Federal function under authority\nof law or an Executive act,\u201d and (3) \u201csubject to the supervision\u201d of the President\nor the head of an Executive agency or military department. Section 2105 defines\n\u201cemployee\u201d to include not only an \u201cofficer,\u201d but also anyone in a larger class of\npersons who, like \u201cofficers,\u201d are engaged in federal functions, but are appointed\nand supervised by specified federal officials other than those able to appoint and\nsupervise \u201cofficers.\u201d The Executive Order similarly imposes certain restrictions on \u201cemployees,\u201d\ndefined to mean \u201cany officer[s] or employee[s] of an agency.\u201d Exec. Order No.\n12674, \u00a7 503(b). Although the Executive Order does not define \u201cofficer\u201d or\n\u201cemployee,\u201d we previously have concluded that the terms \u201care identical in scope\nand meaning with the terms \u2018officer\u2019 and \u2018employee\u2019 as used in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2104\nand 2105.\u201d Fishery Management Councils, 17 Op. O.L.C. at 153. We rested this\nconclusion on three grounds. First, we noted that we had turned to the title 5\ndefinitions for guidance in interpreting the criminal conflict of interest laws, and\n\u201c[b]ecause the objectives of the Order and its implementing regulations are closely\nrelated to those of the conflicts statutes, we [thought] it reasonable to look to title\n5\u2019s definition of \u2018employee\u2019 when elucidating the Order.\u201d Id. at 154 (citation\nomitted). Second, the Executive Order adopts the definition of \u201cagency\u201d from title\n5, with certain exceptions, Exec. Order No. 12674, \u00a7 503(c); and \u201c[w]e [thought] it\nunlikely that the Order was intended to cover personnel who were employed by\n\u2018agencies\u2019 within the meaning of title 5 but who were not themselves \u2018employees\u2019\nwithin the same title.\u201d 17 Op. O.L.C. at 154. Third, while the Executive Order\nstates generally that it is based on the authority vested in the President \u201cby the\nConstitution and laws of the United States,\u201d Exec. Order No. 12674, pmbl., but\ndoes not specify the authorizing statutes, \u201cthe most obvious statutory source of\nauthority\u201d is the President\u2019s power under title 5 to \u201cprescribe regulations for the\nconduct of employees in the executive branch,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301 (2000), and this\nauthority brings into play the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in title 5. 17 Op.

The Standards of Ethical Conduct carry out the Executive Order, and we therefore applied our conclusion in Fishery Management Councils about the applicable\ndefinitions both to the Executive Order and to these implementing regulations. 17\nOp.

O.L.C. at 150 n.2, 158. In addition, we note that some of the particular rules in\nthe Standards of Ethical Conduct rest on specific statutory provisions in title 5 that 33 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 43 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26 use the term \u201cemployee\u201d and so invoke the title 5 definition. The rules about gifts\nto superiors, for example, derive in part from 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7351 (2000), which bars\n\u201c[a]n employee\u201d from receiving or making certain gifts. 2 The reach of the\nStandards of Ethical Conduct thus depends, too, on the meaning of the terms\n\u201cofficer\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d in title 5.\nII. A.\nThe OGE Letter argues that the three parts of the title 5 definitions\u2014\nappointment by a federal official, engagement in a federal function, and federal\ngovernment supervision\u2014need not \u201cbe applied invariably or formalistically in\nevery case where the application of federal ethics requirements is at issue.\u201d OGE\nLetter, supra note 1, at 2. In particular, the OGE Letter cites two opinions of our\nOffice\u2014one in which we quoted a previous opinion for the proposition that the\ntitle 5 definition of employee \u201cis not necessarily conclusive for conflicts purposes,\u201d Fishery Management Councils, 17 Op. O.L.C. at 154 n.12, and one in which\nwe concluded that \u201can identifiable act of appointment may not be absolutely\nessential for an individual to be regarded as an officer or employee in a particular\ncase where the parties omitted it for the purpose of avoiding the application of the\nconflict-of-interest laws or perhaps where there was a firm mutual understanding\nthat a relatively formal relationship existed,\u201d Informal Presidential Advisor, 1 Op.\nO.L.C. at 21. Therefore, the OGE Letter argues, satisfaction of only the first part\nof the title 5 definitions\u2014appointment by a federal official\u2014ought to suffice to\nrender an individual subject to the federal conflict of interest laws. We do not agree. First, as stated above, we have previously opined that the\nterms \u201cofficer[s]\u201d and \u201cemployee[s]\u201d in the Executive Order and the Standards of\nEthical Conduct \u201care identical in scope and meaning with the terms \u2018officer\u2019 and\n\u2018employee\u2019 as used in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2104 and 2105.\u201d Fishery Management Councils, 17 Op. O.L.C. at 153. We have, in short, concluded that the three parts of the\ntitle 5 definitions must be applied invariably in these contexts. Second, with\nrespect to the criminal conflict of interest laws, we do not read our opinions as\nsuggesting any general flexibility to depart from the three-part test, much less to\nsimply disregard two of the three parts. Indeed, particularly in view of the rule of\nlenity, see Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848, 858 (2000) (quoting Rewis v.\nUnited States, 401 U.S. 808, 812 (1971), and United States v.

This definition, however, is congruent with the analysis we set out below. 34 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 44 10/22/12 11:13 AM Application of Conflict of Interest Rules to Appointees Who Have Not Begun Service three-part test. In this regard, our statement that the title 5 definition of employee\n\u201cis not necessarily conclusive for conflicts purposes\u201d might more sensibly be read\nto mean that, in some circumstances, even satisfaction of the three-part test might\nnot conclusively establish that a person is an officer or employee for purposes of\nthe criminal prohibitions. We further note that our conclusion that \u201can identifiable\nact of appointment may not be absolutely essential for an individual to be regarded\nas an officer or employee,\u201d Informal Presidential Advisor, 1 Op. O.L.C. at 21\n(emphasis added), does not mean that we concluded that the requirement of\nappointment by a federal official was not necessary. On the contrary, it presupposes the requirement and merely leaves open the possibility that an individual could\nbe shown to have satisfied the requirement\u2014i.e., to have been appointed\u2014even in\nthe absence of an identifiable act of appointment, if a \u201cformal relationship\u201d had\nbeen established between the individual and the government. Id. We therefore look to the statutory definitions of \u201cofficer\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d in\ntitle 5 in deciding whether the conflict of interest restrictions apply to a person\nwho has been appointed to office by the President with the Senate\u2019s advice and\nconsent but has not yet begun the duties of office. We conclude that a person in\nthese circumstances would not meet at least two of the three statutory tests\u2014\nengagement in a federal function and federal government supervision\u2014and that\nthe conflict of interest restrictions therefore would not apply to him. Chief Justice Marshall explained in Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch)\n137, 162 (1803), that \u201cwhen a commission has been signed by the president, the\nappointment is made.\u201d In the circumstances here, an appointment in the constitutional sense would thus be complete. Whether the signing of a commission would\nconstitute an \u201cappointment\u201d for purposes of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2104 and 2105 may be\nless clear. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held, for\nexample, that appointment under the statute requires \u201caction by the appointee\ndenoting acceptance\u201d and that \u201c[a]cceptance is important, as membership in the\ncivil service imports burdens as well as benefits.\u201d Watts v. OPM, 814 F.2d 1576,\n1580 (Fed. Cir. 1987).

We need not resolve this issue here, however; we instead\nassume arguendo that the first part of the test would be met when the President\nsigned the commission. Nevertheless, status as an employee under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105 (2000) or an officer\nunder 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2104 requires more than an appointment: \u201cOne may be an\nappointee and never achieve the status of employee. There are three elements to\nthe statute and all must be complied with to achieve the status of an employee.\u201d McCarley v. MSPB, 757 F.2d 278, 280 (Fed. Cir. 1985). 3 In McCarley, the 3 On the question whether the Merit Systems Protection Board or the agency taking the underlying\naction should be the respondent, which is not at issue here, McCarley was overruled by Hagmeyer v.\nDep\u2019t of Treasury, 852 F.2d 531 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Congress then amended the statute to clarify this\nquestion. See Amin v. MSPB, 951 F.2d 1247, 1251-54 (Fed. Cir. 1991). 35 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 45 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26 petitioner had been appointed, but had not entered upon the duties of the position. The Merit Systems Protection Board dismissed his claim for lack of jurisdiction,\nbecause jurisdiction depended upon his being an employee. The Federal Circuit\naffirmed, explaining that relief is unavailable \u201cto an appointee who has not\nqualified as an employee by performing a federal function subject to the supervision of a federal employee.\u201d Id.; see also Miller v. MSPB, 794 F.2d 660 (Fed. Cir.\n1986). Your question concerns appointees, like the petitioner in McCarley, who have\nnot entered upon the duties of their offices and have therefore not yet performed a\nfederal function, under the supervision of a federal official. Under 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 2104 and 2105, they are not yet officers or employees and thus are not yet\nsubject to conflict of interest restrictions. The reasoning by which we conclude that the conflict of interest restrictions do\nnot become applicable upon appointment, without more, is not novel. In Marbury,\nChief Justice Marshall carefully distinguished between the President\u2019s act of\nappointment and the appointed officer\u2019s subsequent acceptance of that appointment: \u201cThe appointment is the sole act of the president; the acceptance is the sole\nact of the officer, and is, in plain common sense, posterior to the appointment. As\nhe may resign, so may he refuse to accept.\u201d 5 U.S. at 161; see id. at 162 (\u201cthe\nperson appointed . . . has the absolute, unconditional power of accepting or\nrejecting [the appointment]\u201d). Thus, it is plain under Marbury that the act of\nappointment does not ipso facto make the appointed person an officer or employee. See also Acceptance of a Promotion, 12 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 229, 229 (1867) (\u201ca\nperson cannot be made an incumbent without his consent, and, of course, this he\nmust manifest by some adequate token of his intention\u201d; \u201ca formal acceptance is\nthe evidence which, in the public service generally, it has been customary to\nrequire\u201d).",

Rehnquist used parallel reasoning when\nhe concluded that a United States Attorney would not become subject to a\nparticular rule grounded in conflict of interest principles, where that person had\nbeen appointed as a federal judge but had not yet taken the oath of judicial office\nor begun his judicial duties. See Memorandum for Harlington Wood, Jr., Associate\nDeputy Attorney General, from William H. Rehnquist, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Delay in Induction of Judge into Office\nFollowing His Confirmation by the Senate (Nov. 27, 1970) (\u201cRehnquist Opinion\u201d).

(citation omitted), the issue was \u201cwhether a federal\nofficial vacates his office at the time when the President executes and forwards a\ncommission appointing him to an office incompatible with the one which the\nofficer is holding, or whether the vacation of the office takes place at a later date,\ne.g., when the officer accepts it, or enters upon duty.\u201d Id.

We note, however, that such a rule\nalso enables an appointee to wind up his private affairs in an orderly manner\n(presumably in consultation with the Administration) and therefore may be critical\nto recruiting qualified appointees in the first place. Moreover, in the event of any\nreal abuse, the President could remove the appointee from the office to which he\nhad been appointed, even before he began work. The position advocated in the OGE Letter invites its own set of abuses. If a\nperson were to be subject to conflict of interest restrictions merely upon appointment, the appointing authority \u201cmight prejudice the appointee,\u201d Rehnquist Opinion\nat 7, and even subject him to the threat of criminal liability, by appointing him to\nan office he did not want and would not undertake. Even in the case of voluntary\noffice-seekers, while it would be highly unusual for an appointee, having undertaken the rigors of the appointment process, to refuse his office, such a decision is\nfar from implausible. Our files reveal, for example, that in 1971 a presidential\nappointee decided not to serve after the President signed his commission, because\nhe recently had been elected to Congress. See Memorandum for the Honorable\nDaniel Kingsley, Special Assistant to the President, from Thomas E.

On balance, were we to decide which rule better promoted the underlying\npurposes of the conflict of interest rules, we doubt very much that we would adopt\nthe rule advocated by the OGE Letter. But, for the reasons stated above, the choice\nis not ours to make. C.\nThe OGE Letter further states that \u201c[o]ver the years [OGE has] advised numerous agencies, White House officials, and nominees for Senate-confirmed (PAS)\npositions that an individual becomes subject to the various ethical requirements\nupon appointment.\u201d OGE Letter at 1. We note that it appears that OGE has not\nalways had this view. In 1984, we issued an opinion concluding that a statutory\nbar against outside employment by commissioners of the International Trade\nCommission applied as of the commencement of duties, rather than as of appointment.

In the course of this opinion, we noted that \u201cOGE has indicated\nthat as a general matter, it does not apply similar ethical and conflict of interest\nstandards to employees until the time when they actually begin their employment\nand receive federal pay.\u201d Id. at 10. Although our opinion may require a departure\nfrom OGE\u2019s more recent practice, we are persuaded that OGE\u2019s earlier view of the\nmatter was the better one. D.\nFinally, the OGE Letter expresses concerns about practical application of our\nconclusion. For example, the letter asks whether an officer starts work when he\ntakes the oath of office or performs some official action. 4 We believe that a\nSenate-confirmed official becomes an \u201cofficer\u201d in the relevant sense when, upon\nor after accepting his appointment, he actually begins his duties. At that point, the\nappointee is performing a federal function, under the supervision of the President\nor the agency head.

It suffices that he has begun the work of that\noffice. 5 4\nIn an analogous situation involving a judicial office, the Rehnquist Opinion found it unnecessary\nto choose between \u201cthe time when [the appointee] takes the . . . oath, or when he actually begins to\nexercise his . . . office.\u201d Rehnquist Opinion at 8.\n5 If the official is a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(a) because he is\nexpected to work no more than 130 days in the next year, the first day that, under usual principles, 38 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 48 10/22/12 11:13 AM Application of Conflict of Interest Rules to Appointees Who Have Not Begun Service The question when an official begins the duties of his office is a familiar one\nthat must, irrespective of the conflict of interest prohibitions, be addressed and\nanswered for each official. Specifically, an official is entitled to the salary of his\noffice at the time he enters upon the duties of office, see ITC Opinion at 9-10;\nInterstate Commerce Commission, 19 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 47, 48 (1887), not at the\ntime of appointment or at the time of the oath of office, see United States v.\nFlanders, 112 U.S. 88, 91 (1884); Leave for Transferred Employee, 39 Op. Att\u2019y\nGen. 304, 305-06 (1939) (Jackson, Acting A.G.). A determination of the time\nwhen the conflict of interest rules begin to apply is identical to, and should\ntherefore be no more difficult to make than, the routine determination of the time\nwhen the official begins to accrue his salary.

The OGE Letter asks\nwhether a special government employee who is reappointed would be subject to conflict of interest\nrestrictions during the period after reappointment but before the next day on which he actually works. This question seems to concern special government employees who are not appointed by the President\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate but are reappointed annually, either by the President or by\nanother officer. OGE Letter at 3. We believe that the reappointments of such employees do not place\nthem in the same position as the Senate-confirmed appointees we address in this opinion. In many\ninstances, as a matter of practice, special government employees are employed continuously, and the\nsuccessive one-year appointments are primarily a means of enabling the appointing officer to assess\nwhether the work anticipated in the next year will exceed 130 days and require an end to the\ndesignation as a special, rather than ordinary, government employee. See Office of Government Ethics,\nSpecial Government Employees and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 202, 203, and 205, Informal Advisory Op. 81x24,\nat 2-3 (July 23, 1981), available at http://www.oge.gov/OGE-Advisories/Legal-Advisories/LegalAdvisories/ (last visited July 12, 2012). We believe that the conflict of interest restrictions would apply\ncontinuously to a special government employee, until he resigns or the agency notifies him that he has\nnot been reappointed. 39 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 49 10/22/12 11:13 AM",
