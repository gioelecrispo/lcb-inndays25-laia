      "content": "Trials of Newspaper Personnel\nAccused of Disclosing Naval Secrets It is probable that the newspaper personnel accused of violating the Espionage Act by disclosing naval\nsecrets can each be tried in any district in which the newspaper containing the secrets was received\nby a subscriber or newsstand. The newspaper personnel would be entitled to separate trials unless a conspiracy to violate the\nEspionage Act can be shown. June 16, 1942 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL In an accompanying memorandum of today\u2019s date,* the substantive aspects of\ncertain disclosures of naval information are discussed. A short statement of facts is\nthere given. This memorandum discusses the following questions:\n(1) Assuming a violation of law by the reporter, the managing editor\nof B newspaper, the company publishing it, and the publisher, can\nthey be tried in any district in which the newspaper was received by\na subscriber or newsstand? (2) Can these trials be combined? (3) Assuming a violation of the law by the managing editors of B\nand C newspapers, and a conspiracy between them and A, the reporter, can all be tried jointly in a certain district in which subscribers to\nboth B and C can be found? If no conspiracy exists? The answers appear to be as follows:\n(1) Each defendant can probably be tried in any district in which the\nnewspaper was received. (2) The trials will be separate, in the absence of proof of conspiracy. (3) Assuming a conspiracy, the trial of all can be held jointly in a\ncommon district. *\nEditor\u2019s Note: That memorandum opinion precedes this one (Criminal Liability for Newspaper\nPublication of Naval Secrets, 1 Op. O.L.C. Supp. 93 (June 16, 1942)). 102 Trials of Newspaper Personnel Accused of Disclosing Naval Secrets I. Problems of Venue; Place of Trial\nAssuming a violation of the law by the reporter and his superiors\u2014managing\neditor, publisher, and newspaper company\u2014it is probable that each defendant can\nbe tried (whether separately or jointly will be discussed below) in any district in\nwhich a copy of the newspaper containing the criminal dispatch was received by a\nsubscriber or newsstand. The Constitution of the United States provides that\n\u201cThe trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said\nCrimes shall have been committed . . . ,\u201d Article III, Section 2,\nand that\n\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to\na . . . trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the\ncrime shall have been committed . . . ,\u201d Amendment VI. These constitutional provisions do not give a defendant a constitutional right to\nbe tried only in the district of his residence or principal place of business. Haas v.\nHenkel, 216 U.S. 462 (1909). His right is to a trial in the district where the crime\nwas committed. It seems to be reasonably well established by the Supreme Court that a \u201ccrime,\u201d\nwhich involves a sequence of acts crossing district boundaries, is committed in\nany district in which any substantial act in the sequence took place. Hyde v. United\nStates, 225 U.S. 347 (1911); United States v. Lombardo, 241 U.S. 73 (1915).",

      "content": "Hyde v. United\nStates, 225 U.S. 347 (1911); United States v. Lombardo, 241 U.S. 73 (1915). The\ndiscretion of the Attorney General and the constant supervision of the courts are\nregarded as sufficient safeguards against double jeopardy and unnecessary\nmultiplicity of suits. The most significant act in the crime of \u201ccommunicating\u201d or \u201ctransmitting\u201d a\ndocument relating to national defense to \u201cany person not entitled to receive it\u201d\nunder section 1(d) of the Espionage Act1 must be the actual presentation of the\ncontents of such a document to the person not entitled to receive it. When such\ncommunication or transmission is effected through the medium of a newspaper,\nthat act occurs only when the recipient of the newspaper has it in his control. The\nfactual chain of events which constitute the legal crime begins of course when the\nreporter first illegally scans the forbidden document, but it does not end until the\nwhole institutional apparatus of newspaper publication has deposited the finished\npaper in the hands of the subscriber or purchaser. To seize upon any one factual\nevent in the crime chain\u2014such as the physical rolling of the papers off a press\u2014\nand to say that such an event only is \u201cthe crime\u201d and that the crime is \u201ccommitted\u201d\nonly at the locus of that event would be as unrealistic as it would be subversive of\n1 Act of June 15, 1917, ch. 30, \u00a7 1(d), 40 Stat. 217, 218, codified at 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 31(d) (1940). 103 Supplemental Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 1 the policy of the statute. It is not some physical step in the publishing process\nwhich is prohibited but the communication of defense information to unauthorized\nrecipients. The fact that there may be unauthorized recipients in many districts\nonly aggravates the crime. It would put an insuperable burden upon the government to require it to show which unauthorized recipients actually passed the\ninformation on to the enemy and, hence, to fix its venue there. Direct case authority to support this reasoning is scant. Helpful analogies can,\nhowever, be found in cases involving the unlawful transmission of goods and\nfraudulent mail practices. Charles C. Montgomery, Manual of Federal Jurisdiction\nand Procedure \u00a7 1150 (4th ed. 1942). The famous old case of In re Palliser, 136\nU.S. 257 (1890), which held that the offense of tendering a contract for the\npayment of money in a letter mailed in one district and addressed to a public\nofficer in another, to induce him to violate his official duty, could be tried in the\ndistrict in which the letter was received by that officer, is squarely in point. The\nopinion contains excellent supporting language. Opposing authority is equally scant. The federal criminal libel cases are old, by\nlower courts, not numerous, and poorly reasoned. They have been often criticised. Justin Miller, Handbook of Criminal Law 495 (1934); Recent Cases, Criminal\nLaw\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Locality of Publication of Libel, 23 Harv. L. Rev. 309 (1910);\nComment, Copies of a Printed Criminal Libel as Separate Offenses, 26 Yale L.J.\n308 (1916\u201317). Many state court decisions are to the contrary.

      "content": "Many state court decisions are to the contrary. Annotation, Venue\nof Action for Libel in Newspaper, 37 A.L.R. 914 (1925). The leading case, United\nStates v. Smith, 173 F. 227 (D. Ind. 1909), could easily be distinguished or\ndiscredited. One section of the judicial code, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, could be construed as relevant. This provides that: When any offense against the United States is begun in one judicial\ndistrict and completed in another, it shall be deemed to have been\ncommitted in either, and may be dealt with, inquired of, tried, determined, and punished in either district, in the same manner as if it had\nbeen actually and wholly committed therein. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 731 (2d ed. 1878), 18 Stat. pt. 1, at 139 (repl. vol.), as amended by Act\nof Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, \u00a7 42, 36 Stat. 1087, 1100. If the argument above that a\nsignificant act of the chain \u201ccrime\u201d was \u201ccommitted\u201d in the district where the\nnewspaper was received is accepted, an equally plausible argument could be made\nunder this section that the offense was \u201ccompleted\u201d in such district. The argument\nfrom the facts and from policy would be substantially the same. For determining the place of trial, and allocating power between courts, the\nconcept of \u201cvenue\u201d serves the same function for different federal districts that the\nconcept of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d serves for the states. State courts are\u2014it should be noted\nby way of analogy\u2014rapidly getting away from the naive notion that a \u201ccrime,\u201d 104 Trials of Newspaper Personnel Accused of Disclosing Naval Secrets involving a sequence of acts crossing state boundaries, is physically \u201clocated\u201d on\nsome one spot. Thus Mr. Berge observes:\n[T]he conclusion is irresistible that if the constituent acts of a given\ncrime occur in more than one state, each such state has an equally\nvalid claim to jurisdiction over the whole crime. Such extra-territorial elements should be frankly recognized by courts and no attempt should be made to cover them with legal fictions. Wendell Berge, Criminal Jurisdiction and the Territorial Principle, 30 Mich. L.\nRev. 238, 269 (1931). II. Separate Trials Where two or more defendants are accused of the same crime, i.e., if they are\nconspirators, or principal and accessory, they may be tried together. Even here,\nhowever, the court may in its discretion order separate trials, upon proper motion. Where the crimes are different, though related in nature or linked by events, the\ndefendants are entitled to separate trials, if the objection is seasonably raised. See\nMontgomery, Federal Jurisdiction and Procedure \u00a7 1238; William T. Hughes,\nFederal Practice, Jurisdiction & Procedure \u00a7 7084 (1931 & Supp. 1941). In the instant case, unless the conspiracy theory is relied upon, the defendants\nwould appear to be entitled to separate trials. III. Conspiracy If a conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act can be shown (which does not\nappear probable on the facts now known to me), the defendants can be tried\ntogether in any district in which the conspiracy was formed or in which an act was\ndone to effectuate the object of the conspiracy.

The locus of a suit against reporters, editors and proprietors is a matter of\nmajor importance to the publishing trade. If it is established that suits based on\nlibel or violations of the Espionage Act can be brought at any point at which even\na single subscriber receives the publication, the trade would feel itself in grave\njeopardy. Accordingly, an attempt to start a prosecution at a point remote from the\nplace of publication might raise a nationwide outcry from the press, and prevent\nthe public from reaching an understanding of the merits of the case.
