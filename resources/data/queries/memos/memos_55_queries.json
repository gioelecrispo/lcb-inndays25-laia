We have agreed to assist you\n(1) by identifying the appropriate official(s) to consider and, if appropriate,\napprove such waivers; and (2) by describing some of the factors that may be\nconsidered by that official in applying the waiver standard. We understand that\nyour inquiry was prompted by the case of a potential member of the Commis\u00ad\nsion who has an ongoing consulting arrangement with one of the primary\ncontractors for the MX missile project. We understand from our discussions and the materials you have provided\nthat the Department of Defense has determined that members of this advisory\ncommittee are special government employees for purposes of the conflict of\ninterest laws. See generally 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 202; Federal Personnel Manual, Ap\u00ad\npendix C.

      "content": "18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(b)(1). Because it is anticipated that the\nCommission will be advising the President concerning the MX missile and its\npossible basing modes, the application of \u00a7 208 to this situation has been raised. I. Appropriate Official to Grant Waiver\nUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(b)\nAs mentioned above, \u00a7 208(b) authorizes the \u201cGovernment official respon\u00ad\nsible for the appointment [of an employee] to his position\u201d to waive the\napplication of \u00a7 208(a) to the employee in certain circumstances. In determin\u00ad\ning which officials can exercise such power, we consider two questions: (1)\nwhich official is \u201cresponsible for the appointment\u201d of the members of the\nCommission; and (2) has the official \u201cresponsible for the appointment\u201d del\u00ad\negated his authority under this provision to any other person(s). With respect to the first question, we believe the President is the official\n\u201cresponsible for the appointment\u201d of the members of the Commission. Pursu\u00ad\nant to Executive Order No. 12400, members of the Commission are \u201cappointed\nor designated by the President\u201d to membership on the Commission. There is no\nprovision that any other official should be responsible for the appointment of\nany of the members to the Commission. In the process of drafting Executive\nOrder No. 12400, members of the White House Counsel\u2019s Office and the\nGeneral Counsel\u2019s Office of the Office of Management and consistently ex\u00ad\npressed an intent and understanding that the Commission was to be a Presiden\u00ad\ntial Advisory Committee, with control over the appointment and dismissal of\nmembers of the Commission to be vested solely in the President. Accordingly,\nin our view, the President is the \u201cGovernment official responsible for the\nappointment [of the members] to [their] position[s]\u201d within the meaning of 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 208. Even though the President is the appointing \u201cGovernment official\u201d within\nthe meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208, he may, pursuant to 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 301, delegate\nhis authority with respect to \u201cany function vested in the President by law\u201d to\n\u201cthe head of any department or agency in the executive branch, or any official\nthereof who is required to be appointed by and with the advice and consent of\nthe Senate.\u201d Such delegation must be in writing and published in the Federal\nRegister. Id. In addition, the President has certain inherent authority, which is\nrecognized but not specifically enumerated in 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 302, to delegate\nauthority to officials who do not meet the requirements set forth in \u00a7 301. In\nExecutive Order No. 11222, Part V, as amended, the President delegated his\nauthority to grant waivers under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(b) with respect to many\nPresidentially appointed officers and employees, while specifically exempting\n11 from this delegation, among other persons, \u201cPresidential appointees to commit\u00ad\ntees, boards, commissions, or similar groups established by the President.\u201d In 3\nC.F.R. \u00a7 100.735-32, however, the President delegated to the Counsel to the\nPresident the authority reserved in the above provision. Although the Counsel\nto the President is not appointed by the President with the advice and consent of\nthe Senate, this delegation has existed at least since 1968 and has never, to our\nknowledge, been challenged by Congress.",

      "content": "Although the Counsel\nto the President is not appointed by the President with the advice and consent of\nthe Senate, this delegation has existed at least since 1968 and has never, to our\nknowledge, been challenged by Congress. While we do not need to pass on that\nissue for the purpose of this memorandum, the delegation of power to the\nCounsel to the President would appear to fall within the President\u2019s inherent\npower to delegate, and thus, the President and the Counsel to the President\ncurrently appear to have authority to grant a waiver under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(b) to\nmembers of the Commission with respect to their service on the Commission. An argument could be made that \u00a7 4 of Executive Order No. 12400, which\ncreated the Commission, also delegates to the Secretary of Defense the\nPresident\u2019s authority to grant waivers under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208. We conclude,\nhowever, that if the President wishes the Secretary of Defense to exercise the\nPresident\u2019s authority under \u00a7 208(b), the proper course would be to execute a\nnew, more specific memorandum under 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 301, specifically delegating\nsuch authority to the Secretary of Defense. Section 4 of Executive Order No.\n12400 delegates the \u201cperformance\u201d of the President\u2019s \u201cfunctions\u201d under the\nFederal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1, to\nthe Secretary of Defense. The FACA, 5 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 8, provides, inter alia,\nthat each agency head, in this case the Secretary of Defense, \u201cshall establish\nuniform administrative guidelines and management controls for advisory com\u00ad\nmittees\u201d and appoint an Advisory Committee Management Officer to \u201cexercise\ncontrol and supervision\u201d over the committee. The FACA, however, does not\nspecifically address conflict-of-interest problems related to members of advi\u00ad\nsory committees. Thus, granting a waiver of conflicts of interest under 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 208 may not be a \u201cfunction\u201d \u201cperformed\u201d under the Federal Advisory\nCommittee Act. In light of the fact that the President expressly reserved to\nhimself in Executive Order No. 11222, as amended, the authority to grant\nwaivers under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(b), it is doubtful that the delegation of authority\nin Executive Order No. 12400 is sufficiently specific to constitute a delegation\nof the Presidential waiver authority. For these reasons, if the President wishes\nthe Secretary of Defense, rather than the Counsel to the President, to assume\nthe authority to grant waivers for members of the Commission, we conclude\nthat a new memorandum of delegation should be executed. In addition, if the\nPresident wishes some other official to exercise this authority, he may execute\na memorandum delegating this to any official appointed by the President with\nthe advice and consent of the Senate. See 3 U.S.C \u00a7 301.\nII. The Wanver Standard\nSection 208(b)(1) provides that waivers of the restriction of \u00a7 208(a) may be\ngranted upon a written determination that the disqualifying interest of the\n12 employee is \u201cnot so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity o f\nthe services which the government may expect\u201d from the employee. (Emphasis\nadded.) This standard clearly anticipates the exercise of discretion and personal\njudgment by the appointing official.",

This standard clearly anticipates the exercise of discretion and personal\njudgment by the appointing official. We have not reviewed the facts of this\nmatter in sufficient detail to make our own judgment concerning a waiver in\nthis case, nor would it be appropriate for us to do so inasmuch as the responsi\u00ad\nbility of the Commission will relate to matters that are beyond our knowledge\nand expertise. The discussion that follows is intended simply to direct attention\nto some of the factors which are generally used to inform such judgments. The standard set forth in the statute suggests two lines of inquiry, focusing\non (1) the financial interest and (2) the services of the employee. In our view, it\nis appropriate to consider any factors that develop either of these lines of\ninquiry suggested by the statute. There are numerous factors that may help to clarify the nature and magnitude\nof the employee\u2019s financial interest. Certainly it is helpful to quantify the dollar\namount of the interest, or its outer limits. In this case, the consulting contract\npresumably is worth $50,000, and possibly more if the contract is extended or\nadditional contracts are expected. These factors might be compared with the\npotential member\u2019s overall income, and with his net worth, to obtain some\nsense of the relative value of the consulting contract(s) to him. 1The type of the\nfinancial interest may also be important. In this case, the financial interest\narises from an employment relationship. While employment relationships fre\u00ad\nquently create stronger and more personal ties than ordinary investment rela\u00ad\ntionships, the tenure and details of this particular relationship could be signifi\u00ad\ncant factors in making a waiver determination. For example, one might find it\nmore difficult to justify a \u00a7 208(b) waiver if the potential member\u2019s contract\nactivities involve defense issues that will be before the Commission than if\nthey involve giving technical advice on completely unrelated subjects. Simi\u00ad\nlarly, a long or frequent association with the contractor might also counsel\nagainst a waiver in this case. The employee\u2019s anticipated services to the government should also be exam\u00ad\nined. We think that, in this regard, it is appropriate to consider both the\nlikelihood that the integrity of the employee\u2019s services may be compromised,\nand the nature and significance of the services themselves. In this case, the\nemployee\u2019s services will presumably involve giving advice on a subject of\ndirect concern to a present client of his consulting firm. There appears to be\nlittle doubt that the contractor will be affected by the government\u2019s final\ndecision regarding the MX, but the impact of the potential member\u2019s advice\nthrough the advisory committee may be somewhat more remote. On the other\nhand, one might predict that the advice would be particularly influential in light\nof the potential member\u2019s background and stature.

In this regard, one may want to consider the value of the\nMX contract to the contractor in absolute dollars and as a proportion of the\ncompany\u2019s anticipated receipts for upcoming years. There are undoubtedly numerous other factors that might be considered. Some of these derive more justification from common sense and other disquali\u00ad\nfication standards than they do from the actual text of \u00a7 208(b). See, e.g.,\nDecisional Officials\u2019 Participation in Rulemaking Proceedings, Administrative\nConference of the United States, 1980 Report, at 51-55. See also Code of\nProfessional Responsibility, American Bar Association (in particular Canons\n4, 5 and 9). For example, public disclosure of the employee\u2019s interest and the\ngovernment\u2019s need for the services of the particular employee are factors that\ncould be compelling in some circumstances. 2 We would also advise that some\ndeference be given to the agency\u2019s general policy or practice in granting\nwaivers under \u00a7 208(b)(1). Accordingly, we are not prepared to reject all\nconsideration of factors that do not reflect directly the statutory standard. We\nmust urge, however, that non-statutory factors be used with caution and that the\nweight given to them be analyzed in light of the fact that they are not directly\narticulated in the statutory standard. Numerous other nonstatutory factors have been suggested for use in this\ncase. We think that many of these factors, especially when taken in their\ncombination, could confuse rather than clarify the inquiry. For example, the\nimportance of the advisory committee to the government\u2019s national security\ninterests is a factor that can be used convincingly either to justify or deny a\nwaiver. 3 The same can be said of the temporary, short-term nature of the\nCommission\u2019s work. It also can be counterproductive, in our view, to focus on\nthe reputation for personal integrity of the employee. The integrity factor is\nextremely subjective. As we see it, \u00a7 208 was enacted, in large part, to elimi\u00ad\nnate such subjective judgments from the disqualification process. Furthermore,\nwe fear that a heavy or frequent reliance upon an official judgment of the\nemployee\u2019s personal integrity will detract from the public acceptance of the\nwaiver process, as well as make it more difficult to deny waivers because of the\npossible negative implication o f a denial with respect to the integrity of the\nemployee. Accordingly, we must counsel against a reliance upon a subjective,\npersonal evaluation of an individual\u2019s reputation for integrity in considering\nthe propriety of \u00a7 208(b)(1) waivers. In the end, waiver decisions are committed to the judgment of the appointing\nofficial.",
