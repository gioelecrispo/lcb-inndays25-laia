In its\nJune 23,1988 letter to the National Security Council, GAO described the nature\nand purpose of the investigation: In order to evaluate whether \u201cinformation about\nillegal activities by high level officials of other nations may not be adequately\nconsidered in U.S. foreign policy decisions . . . , the General Accounting Office\nis undertaking an initial case study of how information about General Noriega\nwas developed by various government agencies, and what role such information\nplayed in policy decisions regarding Panama.\u201d As stated in the National Security\nCouncil\u2019s response to GAO of July 13,1988, representatives of GAO have made\nit clear that GAO\u2019s \u201cthree areas of interest [are] intelligence files, law enforce\u00ad\nment files, and the deliberative process of the Executive branch, including inter\u00ad\nnal communications and deliberations leading to Executive branch actions taken\npursuant to the President\u2019s constitutional authority.\u201d Specifically, you have asked this Office to advise you as to whether the GAO\ninvestigation is within GAO\u2019s statutory authority; whether there are statutory or\nconstitutional grounds for denying GA O \u2019s request to the extent it is directed\nspecifically at intelligence information, at law enforcement information, or at de\u00ad\nliberative process information; and whether there are other grounds for denying\nGAO\u2019s request in whole or in part. As explained below, we conclude that on the\npresent record the GAO investigation is beyond GAO\u2019s statutory investigative 171 authority.1 Because of this conclusion it is unnecessary to address any constitu\u00ad\ntional basis for challenging GAO\u2019s authority to conduct the investigation. In ad\u00ad\ndition, we are unable to evaluate the strength of any constitutional objection to\nproviding particular information because specific information requests have not\nyet been made. As a matter of general guidance, however, we outline the consti\u00ad\ntutional principles which would be applied in evaluating whether particular in\u00ad\nformation can be withheld. I.

Statutory Limitations\nG A O \u2019s investigative authority is set forth in subchapter II of chapter 7 of title\n31 o f the U.S. Code. Except for section 7 17(b), the various grants of authority in\nsubchapter II are limited to auditing the finances of government agencies and are\nthus inadequate bases for the GAO Noriega investigation, which clearly goes well\nbeyond a financial audit. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 711-715. Accordingly, GAO must\nbase this investigation on its authority in section 717(b) to \u201cevaluate the results\nof a program or activity the Government carries out under existing law.\u201d 2 Op.\nO.L.C. 415,420 (1978) (emphasis added) (where a GAO investigation goes be\u00ad\nyond fiscal matters, GAO\u2019s authority must be based on section 204(a), the sub\u00ad\nstantially identical predecessor version of section 717(b)). We believe as a matter of statutory construction that the phrase \u201cprogram or\nactivity . . . under existing law \u201d must refer only to activities carried out pursuant\nto statute, and not activities carried out pursuant to the Executive\u2019s discharge of\nits own constitutional responsibilities. 2 The juxtaposition of \u201cprogram or activ\u00ad\nity\u201d with \u201cexisting law\u201d strongly suggests an intent to refer to statutory respon\u00ad\nsibilities. Moreover, the use of the qualifier \u201cexisting\u201d appears to suggest that the\nlaws at issue are statutes that m ay lapse rather than constitutional authorities of\nthe President, which are of greater permanence. Finally, the legislative history of\nsection 717(b) confirms that Congress\u2019 focus of concern was the oversight of its\nlegislative programs: \u201cIt is intended that in performing [evaluations under sec\u00ad\ntion 7 17(b)], the Comptroller General shall review and analyze Government pro\u00ad\ngram results in a manner which will assist the Congress to determine whether\nthose programs and activities are achieving the objectives of the law.\u201d H.R. Rep.\nNo. 1215,91st Cong., 2d Sess. 82 (1970). Nothing in the legislative history man\u00ad\n1 M oreover, in addition to G A O \u2019s lack o f statutory authority to pursue this investigation, we believe that the In\u00ad\ntelligence Oversight A ct for Fiscal Year 1981, Pub. L. No. 9 6-450, \u00a7 407,94 Stat. 1975, 1981 (1980), extinguishes\nw hatever authority GAO might otherwise possess in gaining access to intelligence information\n2 The views we express here concerning the limitations on G A O \u2019s investigative authority under section 717(b)\nare not novel. In 1978, the O ffice opined that G A O \u2019s authonty under the similarly worded predecessor to 717(b)\ndid not extend to the discharge o f the President's constitutional, as opposed to statutory, responsibilities. 2 Op.\nO.L.C. 415, 420 (1978) (\u201c [T]he appointment o f officers o f the United States by the President by and with the ad\u00ad\nvice o f the Senate does not constitute a G overnment program or activity carried out under existing law . . . . \u201d). 172 ifests any congressional intent to extend GAO\u2019s investigative authority beyond\nstatutory programs into the Executive\u2019s discharge of its constitutional responsi\u00ad\nbilities.",

GAO Has Not Justified its Investigation Under Section 717(b) We conclude on the record before us that GAO has not established that it has\nauthority under section 717(b) to pursue this investigation. The subject of the in\u00ad\nvestigation according to GAO is foreign policymaking, a subject matter which is\ngenerally within the purview of the President\u2019s power under Article II of the Con\u00ad\nstitution. GAO has failed to assert any interest in evaluating the results of any\nspecific statutory program or activity that may relate to foreign policy. As this Office has consistently observed,3 Section 1 of Article II confers on\nthe President plenary authority to represent the United States and to pursue its\ninterests outside the borders of the country, subject only to limits specifically set\nforth in the Constitution itself and to such statutory limitations as the Constitu\u00ad\ntion permits Congress to impose by exercising one of its enumerated powers. See\ngenerally United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304 (1936). Specifically, the President\u2019s constitutional authority includes the authority to ne\u00ad\ngotiate with foreign nations, to articulate the foreign policy of the United States,\nto carry out diplomatic and intelligence missions, and to protect the lives of Amer\u00ad\nicans abroad. Id. Of course, pursuant to its own substantial authority under the Commerce\nClause and its exclusive power of appropriation, Congress has enacted statutes\nthat relate to the foreign policy of the United States. For instance, Congress has\nappropriated funds for foreign assistance and enacted statutes regulating arms\nsales to foreign governments. If GAO were to express a specific interest in ma\u00ad\nterials relating to such statutes, there would be reasonable and legitimate ques\u00ad\ntions as to which materials were within the scope of G AO\u2019s section 717(b) au\u00ad\nthority, and which were not. The request before us, however, does not present these close questions. The\nGAO letter of June 23,1988 makes it clear that foreign policymaking is the sub\u00ad\nject of the GAO investigation, and it provides no basis for concluding that GAO\nis interested in reviewing Executive foreign policymaking pursuant to statutory\nauthority. The GAO letter states that the GAO investigation is premised on a con\u00ad\ncern that \u201cinformation about illegal activities by high level officials of other na\u00ad\ntions may not be adequately considered in U.S. foreign policy decisions\u201d and that\nit is directed at learning \u201cwhat role [information about General Noriega] played\nin policy decisions regarding Panama.\u201d The GAO letter thus demonstrates an in\u00ad 3\nSee, e g , Memorandum for Judith H.

We therefore conclude based on the nature of the GAO request that the sub\u00ad\nject of the GAO investigation is the Executive\u2019s discharge of its constitutional\nforeign policy responsibilities, not its statutory responsibilities. The subject is\nthus not \u201ca program or activity the Government carries our under existing law,\u201d\nand it is beyond GAO\u2019s authority under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 717(b). Accordingly, unless\nthis request is tailored to inquire specifically about a program or activity carried\nout under existing statutory law, we believe there is no obligation to grant GAO\naccess to executive branch agencies for purposes of conducting this investiga\u00ad\ntion. B. Intelligence Oversight In addition to the infirmity in GAO\u2019s statutory authority to pursue this inves\u00ad\ntigation, we believe that GAO is specifically precluded by statute from access to\nintelligence information. In establishing by law the oversight relationship be\u00ad\ntween the intelligence committees and the executive branch, Congress indicated\nthat such oversight would be the exclusive means for Congress to gain access to\nconfidential intelligence information in the possession of the executive branch. 4 This intelligence oversight system has been codified at 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 413. That\nsection sets forth requirements for the Director of Central Intelligence, the heads\nof all other federal agencies involved in intelligence activities, and the President\nto inform the Congress through the intelligence committees (and in some cir\u00ad\ncumstances the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives and\nthe majority and minority leaders of the Senate) of intelligence activities. The legislative history of section 413 makes it clear that both the legislative\nand executive branches believed they were establishing a comprehensive scheme\nfor congressional oversight of intelligence activities that would constitute the ex\u00ad\nclusive means of congressional oversight. As President Carter stated when he\nsigned the section into law, it\nestablishes, for the first time in statute, a comprehensive system\nfor congressional oversight of intelligence activities The over\u00ad\nsight legislation that was passed ... codifies the current practice\n4 As a general matter, intelligence gathering is often viewed as a form of diplomatic activity that is within the\nPresident\u2019s Article n powers. As Professor Louis Henkin has noted, \u201c[t]he gathering of information is a principal\npurpose of sending ambassadors and maintaining diplomatic relations, an exclusive Presidential power. It is only\na small extension to conclude that gathering information by any means is part of the President\u2019s \u2018eyes and ears\u2019\nfunction. There is, therefore, a strong case for presidential authonty to obtain intelligence not only through our em\u00ad\nbassies but also through our agents representing the Executive . . . . \u201d Letter from Louis Henkin to Representative\nLouis Stokes, March 31, 1987, reprinted in HM. 1013, H.R. 1371, and Other Proposals Which Address the Issue\no f Affording Prior Notice of Covert Actions to Congress: Hearings Before the Subcomm on Legislation o f the House\nPermanent Select Comm, on Intelligence, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 221 (1987). 174",

It is a bill that establishes the con\u00ad\ngressional oversight procedures dealing with our intelligence agencies.\u201d6 Sena\u00ad\ntor Huddleston also agreed, in a floor colloquy with Senator Javits on S. 2284,\nwith the following statement by Senator Javits:\n1 agree thoroughly with the need for simplifying [the practice of\nthe oversight committees]. There are some seven committees here\nthat could have had this wrestling match with the executive . . . . I am satisfied ... that the method we now have chosen ... repre\u00ad\nsents a fair, effective, and objective way in which to accomplish\nthe results of simplifying the intelligence relations between the\nPresident and Congress ... and limiting further the opportunities\nfor misadventure, premature disclosure, and so forth . . . . What\nwe are doing is simply legislating... a new arrangement or modus\nvivendi for the handling of information and consultations between\nCongress and the intelligence agencies ... ? The Senate report on S. 2284 also confirms the understanding that congres\u00ad\nsional oversight with respect to intelligence matters was to be limited to the in\u00ad\ntelligence committees. In the \u201cgeneral statement\u201d that preceded the section by\nsection analysis, the report noted: Out of necessity, intelligence activities are conducted primar\u00ad\nily in secret. Because of that necessary secrecy, they are not sub\u00ad\nject to public scrutiny and debate as is the case for most foreign\npolicy and defense issues. Therefore, the Congress, through its in\u00ad\ntelligence oversight committees, has especially important duties\nin overseeing these vital activities by the intelligence agencies of\nthe United States.

The Executive branch and the intelligence oversight committees\nhave developed over the last four years a practical relationship\nbased on comity and mutual understanding, without confronta\u00ad\ntion. The purpose of [section 413] is to carry this working rela\u00ad\ntionship forward into statute. 8 Based on the evidence of intent on the part of both the legislative and execu\u00ad\ntive branches that oversight by the intelligence committees would be the exclu\u00ad\nsive method of congressional oversight concerning intelligence information, we\nconclude that 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 413 stands as statutory authority for the Administra\u00ad\ntion to decline to provide GAO with access to any intelligence information sought\nin the Noriega investigation. II. Executive Privilege Should GAO, in response to an appropriate direction from Congress, subse\u00ad\nquently undertake an investigation properly related to its statutory authority, it\nwould then be necessary to review established principles concerning the main\u00ad\ntenance of confidentiality with respect to certain executive branch information. Congressional investigations normally do not pose this problem to the degree\nsuggested by the pending GAO investigation because they are properly tailored\nto address non- confidential subjects. Disturbingly, and in contrast, the type of\ninformation in which GAO expressed interest in its letter of June 23, 1988 sug\u00ad\ngests a desire to review confidential material generally not available outside the\nexecutive branch, such as intelligence, law enforcement, and deliberative process\ninformation. 9 Since GAO has not yet made any specific requests, we cannot analyze the case\nfor withholding any particular document or information. What we do below is\nsummarize briefly the general executive privilege principles that apply in the in\u00ad\ndividual contexts of intelligence, law enforcement, and deliberative process in\u00ad\nformation. A. Protection of Intelligence Information In the hierarchy of executive privilege, the \u201cprotection of national security\u201d\nconstitutes the strongest interest that can be asserted by the President and one to\n8 S Rep. No. 730, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1980) (emphasis added) More specifically, the Senate report stated\nthat \u201c[t]his amendment repeals the congressional reporting requirement of the Hughes-Ryan Amendment of 1974\n. . . The effect is to limit reporting to the two intelligence oversight committees, as compared with the seven com\u00ad\nmittees that now receive such reports . . . \u201d Id at 5.\n9 This subject is usually discussed in terms of \u201cexecutive privilege,\u201d and we will use that convention here. The\nquestion, however, is not strictly speaking just one of executive privilege. The pnvdege itself need not be claimed\nformally vis-a-vis Congress except m response to a lawful subpoena 176 which the courts have traditionally shown the utmost deference. In United States\nv. Nixon, for instance, the Court contrasted President Nixon\u2019s claim of executive\nprivilege based on the Executive\u2019s general interest in confidentiality with a claim\nbased on the President\u2019s national security responsibilities:\n[President Nixon] does not place his claim of privilege on the\nground they are military or diplomatic secrets.

Protection of Law Enforcement Information With respect to open law enforcement files, it has been the policy of the ex\u00ad\necutive branch throughout our Nation\u2019s history to protect these files from any\nbreach of confidentiality, except in extraordinary circumstances. Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral Robert H. Jackson well articulated the basic position: It is the position of this Department, restated now with the ap\u00ad\nproval of and at the direction of the President, that all investiga\u00ad\ntive reports are confidential documents of the executive depart\u00ad\nment of the Government, to aid in the duty laid upon the President\nby the Constitution to \u201ctake care that the Laws be faithfully exe\u00ad\ncuted,\u201d and that congressional or public access to them would not\nbe in the public interest. Disclosure of the reports could not do otherwise than seriously\nprejudice law enforcement. Counsel for a defendant or prospec\u00ad\ntive defendant, could have no greater help than to know how much\nor how little information that Government has, and what witnesses\nor sources of information it can rely upon. This is exactly what\nthese reports are intended to contain. 40 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 45, 46 (1941). There are, however, circumstances in which the Department of Justice may\ndecide to disclose to Congress information about prosecutorial decisions. This is\nparticularly true where an investigation has been closed without further prose\u00ad\ncution. In such a situation concerns about real or perceived congressional inter\u00ad\nference with an investigation, and about the effects of undue pretrial publicity on\na jury, would disappear. Still, extreme caution must be applied whenever the dis\u00ad\nclosure of such records is contemplated. Much of the information in a closed\ncriminal enforcement file such as unpublished details of allegations against par\u00ad\n177 ticular individuals and details that would reveal confidential sources and inves\u00ad\ntigative techniques and methods would continue to merit protection. C. Protection of Deliberative Process Information The Constitution gives the President the power to protect the confidentiality\nof deliberations within the executive branch. See Nixon v. Administrator of Gen.\nServs., 433 U.S. 425, 446 455 (1977); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 708. This is independent of the President\u2019s power over foreign affairs or national se\u00ad\ncurity, or law enforcement; it is rooted instead in \u201cthe necessity for protection of\nthe public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Pres\u00ad\nidential decisionmaking.\u201d Id. at 708. The Supreme Court has held that, for this\nreason, communications among the President and his advisers enjoy \u201ca pre\u00ad\nsumptive privilege\u201d against disclosure in court. Id. The reasons for this privilege, the Court said in United States v. Nixon, are\n\u201cplain.\u201d \u201cHuman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemina\u00ad\ntion of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances\nand for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process. \u201d Id.\nat 705.

Advisors change\ntheir views, or make mistakes which others correct; this is indeed the purpose\nof internal debate. The result is that advisors are likely to be inhibited if they\nmust anticipate that their remarks will be disclosed to others, not party to the\ndebate, who may misunderstand the significance of a particular statement or\ndiscussion taken out of context. Some advisors may hesitate out of self interest\nto make remarks that might later be used against their colleagues or superiors. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[a] President and those who assist him must\nbe free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making de\u00ad\ncisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except pri\u00ad\nvately.\u201d Id. at 708. These reasons for the constitutional privilege have at least as much force when\nit is Congress, instead of a court, that is seeking information. 10The United States\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has explicitly held that\nthe privilege protects presidential communications against congressional in\u00ad\nquiries.\" 10 The Supreme Court has assumed that the constitutional privilege protects executive branch deliberations\nagainst Congress to some degree. See United States v Nixon, 418 U S. at 712 n.19. Moreover, in Nixon v. Admin\u00ad\nistrator o f Gen. Servs., 433 U.S. 425 (1977), the Court held that the constitutional privilege protects executive\nbranch deliberations from disclosure to members of the same branch in a later administration; the Court rejected\nthe specific claim of privilege in that case not because the privilege was inapplicable but because the intrusion was\nlimited and the interests justifying the intrusion were strong and nearly unique. See id. at 446-55. 11 During the Watergate investigation the court of appeals rejected a Senate committee\u2019s efforts to obtain tape\nrecordings of conversations in President Nixon\u2019s offices The court held that the tapes were constitutionally privi\u00ad\nleged and that the committee had not made a strong enough showing to overcome the privilege. Senate Select Comm,\non Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d 725 (D.C Cir 1974) (en banc). The court held that the com\u00ad\nmittee was not entitled to the recordings unless it showed that \u201cthe subpoenaed evidence is demonstrably critical\nto the responsible fulfillment of the Committee\u2019s functions \u201d Id at 731 (emphasis added). 178 D. Accommodation with Congress 1. Governing Principles Because a claim of executive privilege is not absolute, the executive branch\nhas a duty to seek to accommodate requests that are within Congress\u2019 legitimate\noversight powers. See United States v. AT&T, 567 F.2d 121, 127 130 (D.C. Cir.\n1977) (suggesting that, even when a claim of executive privilege rests on national\nsecurity grounds, the Executive does not enjoy clear and absolute discretion to\ndeny legitimate congressional requests for information, but that each of the two\nbranches must attempt to balance and accommodate the legitimate needs of the\nother).",

In this spirit, the Executive has occasionally offered Congress sum\u00ad\nmaries of documents prepared in such a manner as not to disclose, for example,\ndeliberative aspects that might chill executive branch decisionmaking. See id. at\n22-23. The nature of the accommodation required in responding to a congressional\nrequest for information depends on the balance of interests between the Execu\u00ad\ntive and Congress. In order for its interests to be given weight, Congress must ar\u00ad\nticulate its need for the particular materials; it must \u201cpoint[] to . .. specific leg\u00ad\nislative decisions that cannot responsibly be made without access to materials\nuniquely contained\u201d in the presumptively privileged documents (or testimony) it\nhas requested, and show that the material \u201cis demonstrably critical to the re\u00ad\nsponsible fulfillment of the Committee\u2019s functions.\u201d Senate Select Comm, on\nPresidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d at 731, 733.13\n12 It should be emphasized, however, that in United States v. AT&T the information Congress sought related to\nwiretaps on American citizens placing telephone calls from the United States. Although these wiretaps were justi\u00ad\nfied on national security grounds and the President, in turn, could assert national security as a basis for withhold\u00ad\ning the information, Congress clearly had a substantial interest in this subject matter, because the wiretaps impli\u00ad\ncated the individual rights of American citizens. Accordingly, we believe that a court may view the relative weights\nof executive and legislative interests differently when the information sought relates directly to the conduct of for\u00ad\neign relations rather than to the rights of American citizens. 13 In Senate Select Committee, for example, the court held that the committee had not made a sufficient show\u00ad\ning of need for copies of the presidential tape recordings, given that the President had already released transcripts\nof the recordings. The committee argued that it needed the tape recordings \u201cin order to verify the accuracy o f\u2019 the\ntranscripts, to supply the deleted portions, and to gain an understanding that could be acquired only by hearing the\ninflection and tone of voice of the speakers. But the court answered that in order to legislate a committee of Con\u00ad\ngress seldom needs a \u201cprecise reconstruction of past events.\u201d 498 F.2d at 732. \u201cThe Committee has . . . shown no\nmore than that the materials deleted from the transcripts may possibly have some arguable relevance to the subjects\nit has investigated and to the areas in which it may propose legislation. It points to no specific legislative decisions\nthat cannot responsibly be made without access to materials uniquely contained in the tapes or without resolution\nof the ambiguities that the transcripts may contain.\u201d Id. at 733.",

For this reason, the court stated, \u201cthe need demon\u00ad\nstrated by the Select Committee .. is too attenuated and too tangential to its functions\u201d to override the President\u2019s\nconstitutional privilege Id 179 2. Procedural Issues Only rarely do congressional requests for information result in a subpoena of\nan executive branch official or in other congressional action. In most cases the\ninformal process of negotiation and accommodation recognized by the courts,\nand mandated for this Administration by President Reagan,14 is sufficient to re\u00ad\nsolve any dispute. On occasion, however, the process breaks down, and a sub\u00ad\npoena is issued by a congressional committee or subcommittee. 15 At that point,\nit would be necessary to consider asking the President to assert executive privi\u00ad\nlege. Under the terms of the President\u2019s Memorandum, executive privilege can\u00ad\nnot be asserted vis-a-vis Congress without specific authorization by the Presi\u00ad\ndent, based on recommendations made to him by the concerned department head,\nthe Attorney General, and the Counsel to the President. Conclusion We believe that there are statutory grounds which preclude GAO\u2019s present re\u00ad\nquest for access to executive branch agencies for the purposes of conducting the\ninvestigation described in its letter of June 23, 1988. Should GAO\u2019s request be\nreformulated in a manner which properly relates it to a congressional interest\nwithin the terms of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 717(b) and which comports with the statutory re\u00ad\nstrictions on access to intelligence information found in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 413, it will\nbe appropriate at that time to consider the application of additional lawful au\u00ad\nthority to withhold particular national security, intelligence, law enforcement, or\ndeliberative process information. This Office is available for consultation with\nrespect to requests for particular documents or information. D o u g l a s W . K m ie c Acting Assistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel\n14 President Reagan\u2019s November 4,1982 Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\non \u201cProcedures Governing Responses to Congressional Requests for Information\u201d states: The policy of this Administration is to comply with Congressional requests for information to the\nfullest extent consistent with the constitutional and statutory obligations of the Executive Branch . [E]xecutive pnvilege will be asserted only in the most compelling circumstances, and only after care\u00ad\nful review demonstrates that assertion of the privilege is necessary Historically, good faith negotia\u00ad\ntions between Congress and the Executive Branch have minimized the need for invoking executive\nprivilege, and this tradition of accommodation should continue as the primary means of resolving con\u00ad\nflicts between the Branches. 15 In the current context, such a subpoena could only be issued after GAO had reported to its congressional re\u00ad\nquester that it was unable to obtain the information from the executive branch. Before requesting that a congres\u00ad\nsional committee issue a subpoena, GAO might attempt to enforce its request for information pursuant to the judi\u00ad\ncial enforcement mechanism authorized under 3 1 U S C \u00a7716.",
