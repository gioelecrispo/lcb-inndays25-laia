      "content": "Authority of Acting FBI Officials to\nSign National Security Letters\nUnder the statutes authorizing the FBI to issue national security letters, the Director of the\nFBI may designate Acting Deputy Assistant Directors and Acting Special Agents in\nCharge to sign national security letters. January 16, 2009 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL\nFEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION You have asked whether an official acting temporarily in the position\nof Deputy Assistant Director at the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) or Special Agent in Charge of an FBI field office\nmay sign national security letters (\u201cNSLs\u201d). By statute, NSLs may be\nissued by \u201c[t]he Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or his\ndesignee in a position not lower than Deputy Assistant Director at Bureau\nheadquarters or a Special Agent in Charge in a Bureau field office designated by the Director.\u201d E.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2709(b) (2006). 1 We conclude\nthat, under the NSL statutes, the Director of the FBI (\u201cDirector\u201d) may\ndesignate Acting Deputy Assistant Directors and Acting Special Agents in\nCharge to sign NSLs. 2 1 Memorandum for the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal\nCounsel, from Valerie E. Caproni, General Counsel, Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(Mar. 27, 2008) (\u201cFBI Memorandum\u201d). 2 You also raise the question whether the conferral of authority to sign NSLs on Acting\nDeputy Assistant Directors and Acting Special Agents in Charge would square with the\nAppointments Clause; your memorandum assumes that the authority to sign NSLs implicates the Appointments Clause and that employees who sign NSLs must be appointed in\naccordance with that Clause. See FBI Memorandum at 6. We understand that the Director\nselects Acting Deputy Assistant Directors and Special Agents in Charge from among\nspecial agents and members of \u2018the FBI Senior Executive Service, and that the authority\nto appoint these officials has been delegated (and, in some cases, redelegated) from the\nAttorney General to subordinate officials of the FBI. See id. at 1, 6\u20137. As our Office\npreviously has stated, the \u201cquestion whether [the head of a department may] delegate\nappointment authority to an officer below the head of the department is a difficult one,\nand we cannot provide a definitive answer at this time.\u201d Assignment of Certain Functions\nRelated to Certain Military Appointments, 29 Op. O.L.C. 133, 135 (2005). We noted in\nparticular that \u201c[t]he Clause was designed to \u2018limit[] the universe of eligible recipients of 146 Authority of Acting FBI Officials to Sign National Security Letters I.\nUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2709 (2006), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3414 (2006), and 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1681u (2006), the FBI may issue NSLs seeking information relevant to\nnational security investigations. 3 In particular, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2709(b) allows\nthe FBI to obtain from a wire or electronic communications service provider the name, address, length of service, and billing records of a subscriber, while 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3414 deals with customer records from financial institutions, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681u with certain information from\nconsumer reporting agencies. To issue an NSL under these statutes, the\nFBI must certify in writing that the information requested \u201cis sought for\nthe conduct of an authorized investigation to protect against international\nterrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.\u201d",

Id.\n\u00a7 1681v(b). We understand that, despite this textual difference, the FBI\u2019s policy is to\nfollow the same procedures for issuing NSLs under section 1681v as for other NSLs. 147 33 Op.

See Memorandum for Richard L.\nThornburgh, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, from Antonin Scalia, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re:\nDesignation of a Deputy Assistant Attorney General to Act as Assistant\nAttorney General at 3\u20134 (Sept. 9, 1975) (\u201cDesignation of a Deputy Assistant Attorney General \u201d); Memorandum for Stephen S.

Applying this principle, a 1975 opinion of our Office concluded that\nthe federal wiretap statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516 (1970), permitted an Acting\nAssistant Attorney General to authorize wiretap applications, even though\nthe statute provided for authorization by the \u201c[t]he Attorney General, or\nany Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney\nGeneral.\u201d See Designation of a Deputy Assistant Attorney General at 3, 6. Our opinion was prompted by dicta in United States v. Acon, 513 F.2d\n513, 516 (3d Cir. 1975), stating that Acting Assistant Attorneys General\ncould not authorize wiretap applications because the statute did not list\nthem. We disagreed with that view. We argued that Acon had erroneously\nrelied on United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505 (1974), which had held\nthat the Attorney General\u2019s Executive Assistant could not approve a\n148 Authority of Acting FBI Officials to Sign National Security Letters wiretap application because the statute did not name the \u201cExecutive\nAssistant\u201d as among the officials to whom the Attorney General could\ndelegate his authority, and the statute\u2019s legislative history revealed an\nintent to restrict the delegation of authority to a small group of politically\nresponsive, senior Department of Justice officials. See Designation of a\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General at 2. Giordano was not relevant to the\nissue at hand, we explained, because whether a power may be delegated to\na particular official and whether an acting official may exercise that\npower are two distinct issues; Acon erred by failing to distinguish between\nan intent to limit delegation and the \u201cextraordinary\u201d intent \u201cto reverse the\nnormal rule concerning authority of acting officers.\u201d Id. at 4. We noted\nthat reading a delegation limitation to exclude acting officials from a\nfunction would substantially expand the restriction with relatively small\nbenefits. Id. Any such exceptions to the general rule about acting officials,\nwe also noted, would impose a significant burden on acting officials by\nmaking it difficult to determine which powers of the permanent office\nthey possess.

Id. at 6 (citing Pellicci, 504 F.2d at 1107). Thus, although\nwe recognized that \u201ccongressional concern for the sensitivity of a function\ncould result in not merely the commitment of that function to particular\nofficials but also in a prohibition against exercise of the function by any\nacting holders of the named offices,\u201d we concluded that evidence of intent\nto limit the delegability of a function alone would not show that Congress\nalso intended to preclude acting officials from performing that function. Id. at 4.\nA 1984 opinion of our Office reaffirmed the conclusions of our 1975\nopinion. Nonetheless, we observed that intervening court cases had extended Giordano\u2019s analysis to preclude Acting Assistant Attorneys General from authorizing wiretap applications. See Authority of Acting Assistant Attorney General at 1. We therefore advised caution in pursuing the\nposition that the wiretap statute permitted Acting Assistant Attorneys\nGeneral to approve wiretap applications. The wiretap statute, however,\npresented a specialized concern that is not presented by the NSL statutes. As described in Giordano, the legislative history of the wiretap statute\nrevealed congressional intent to limit authority to approve wiretap applications to officials who could be held accountable through the political\nprocess, and it suggested that perhaps only Senate-confirmed presidential\nappointees are politically responsive in the relevant sense. See id. at 2\u20133\n149 33 Op. O.L.C. 146 (2009) (citing Giordano, 416 U.S. at 520 & n.9). Thus, cases such as Acon stated\nthat \u201can acting assistant attorney general [does not] meet the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s test of political responsiveness.\u201d Acon, 513 F.2d at 516. The NSL\nstatutes, in contrast, expressly authorize the issuance of NSLs by officials\nwho are not Senate-confirmed and arguably are not politically responsive\naccording to Giordano, and the legislative history of the NSL statutes,\ndescribed in more detail below, does not reveal any special concern about\nthe political accountability of officials who issue NSLs. If the NSL statutes simply named \u201cDeputy Assistant Directors\u201d and\n\u201cSpecial Agents in Charge\u201d as among the officials whom the Director\ncould designate to issue NSLs, the presumption about acting officials and\nour 1975 opinion would lead directly to the conclusion that Acting Deputy Assistant Directors and Acting Special Agents in Charge could sign\nNSLs. See Designation of Deputy Assistant Attorney General at 5 (\u201c[T]he\nnaming of the office[] goes merely to the level of which delegation is\npermitted and not to the issue of whether, for an interim period, a temporary holder of that office can perform the delegated function.\u201d). The text\nof these statutes, however, raises a substantial and difficult question\nwhether \u201ccongressional concern for the sensitivity of \u201d NSL functions has\nresulted \u201cin a prohibition against exercise of [such] function[s] by any\nacting holders of the named offices.\u201d Id. at 4.

This language is\nunusual and might suggest a congressional intent to limit the exercise of\nNSL authority to permanent appointees, who, unlike acting officials,\nperhaps are more fittingly characterized as \u201cin a position.\u201d 4\n4 We are aware of two other statutes that use the formulation \u201cin a position not lower\nthan.\u201d See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g( j ) (2006) (authorizing \u201cthe Attorney General (or any\nFederal officer or employee, in a position not lower than an Assistant Attorney General,\ndesignated.by the Attorney General),\u201d to seek an ex parte court order allowing access to\neducational records in connection with terrorism investigations or prosecutions (emphasis\nadded)); id. \u00a7 9573(e) (similar). Neither our Office nor any court has considered the\nmeaning of these provisions. 150 Authority of Acting FBI Officials to Sign National Security Letters II. Statutes about the designation of acting officials typically do not refer\nto such officials as being \u201cin a position.\u201d The Vacancies Reform Act\n(\u201cVRA\u201d), for example, says that an acting officer \u201cshall perform the\nfunctions and duties\u201d of the vacant office. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345(a) (2006). Other statutes use similar language or provide that the acting official shall\n\u201cserve as\u201d or shall \u201cbe\u201d \u201cActing [Title]\u201d in the event of a vacancy, absence, or disability. See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 154(d) (2006) (providing that\n\u201cthe Vice Chairman [of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] acts as Chairman and\nperforms the duties of the Chairman until a successor is appointed or the\nabsence or disability ceases\u201d); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462a(c)(3)(B) (2006) (\u201cIn the\nevent of a vacancy in the position of Director [of the Office of Thrift\nSupervision] or during the absence or disability of the Director, the Deputy Director shall serve as Acting Director.\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 508 (2006) (\u201cIn\ncase of a vacancy in the office of Attorney General, or, of his absence or\ndisability, the Deputy Attorney General may exercise all the duties of that\noffice.\u201d) (emphases added). The existence of these formulations, however, does not demonstrate\nthat by using the language \u201cin a position not lower than,\u201d Congress sought\nto preclude Acting Deputy Assistant Directors from exercising NSL\nfunctions. Nothing in the statutes speaks directly to the issue of acting\nofficials, and the phrase \u201cin a position not lower than\u201d easily could refer\nto the level to which the function may be delegated. In light of the distinction we drew in our 1975 opinion between provisions that restrict delegability and those that exclude acting officials from performing a function, and in light of the well-established presumption that acting officials\nmay exercise the same authorities as permanent officeholders, the NSL\nstatutes are best read as placing a limit on delegation, not overturning the\nordinary presumption about acting officials.",

The legislative history of the NSL statutes generally supports the view\nthat Congress sought to limit the delegation of NSL functions to FBI\nofficials at the level of Deputy Assistant Director or above, rather than\nto preclude Acting Deputy Assistant Directors from issuing NSLs. As\n151 33 Op.

In the conference reports accompanying 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3414 and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681u,\nhowever, the conferees stated that the Director should not delegate NSL\nauthority below the level of Deputy Assistant Director.

(\u201cAs is the case with the FBI\u2019s existing National Security Letter\nauthority . . . , the conferees expect, that if the Director of the FBI delegates th[ese] function[s] under [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681u], the Director will\ndelegate [them] no further than the level of FBI Deputy Assistant Director.\u201d); see also H.R.

As a preliminary matter, we note\nthat the language in the NSL statutes, \u201cin a position not lower than,\u201d may\nnot apply to Special Agents in Charge of FBI field offices.

Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001). On this reading, because the \u201cin a position not lower than\u201d language\nwould not apply to Special Agents in Charge, they would simply be\nnamed among the officials whom the Director could designate to exercise\nNSL authorities.

      "content": "Even if the phrase \u201cin a position not lower than\u201d applies to Special\nAgents in Charge, however, we would still read the statute as limiting\ndelegation only, rather than overturning the presumption that acting\nofficers may exercise the full powers of the offices in which they temporarily serve. Like the legislative history discussed above, the legislative\nrecord behind the addition of Special Agents in Charge to the NSL statutes does not show any congressional concern about the issuance of NSLs\nby acting officials. When Congress added Special Agents in Charge to the\nNSL statutes, it sought to expand, not restrict, the class of officials who\nmay be authorized to issue NSLs. In 2001, Congress amended the NSL\nstatutes to permit the Director to designate a \u201cSpecial Agent in Charge in\na Bureau field office,\u201d in addition to headquarters officials at the level of\nDeputy Assistant Director or above. Pub. L. No. 107-56, \u00a7 505, 115 Stat.\nat 365\u201366. In hearings on the proposed legislation, a Department of Justice official explained that the proposed amendment would \u201callow special\nagents in charge\u2014that is, the top-ranking FBI field agent in each of the\nFBI\u2019s 56 field offices\u2014to issue one of these letters rather than requiring\nthe letter to be sent out by an Assistant Director at headquarters.\u201d S. 1448,\nThe Intelligence to Prevent Terrorism Act of 2001 and Other Legislative\nProposals in the Wake of the September 11, 2001 Attacks: Hearing Before\nthe S. Select Comm. on Intelligence, 107th Cong. 24 (2001) (statement of\nDavid Kris, Associate Deputy Attorney General). A section-by-section\nanalysis similarly explained that, \u201cbecause [NSLs] require the signature of\na high-ranking official at FBI headquarters, they often take months to be\nissued. . . . In many cases, counterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations suffer substantial delays while waiting for NSLs to be prepared,\nreturned from headquarters, and served. The section would streamline the\nprocess of obtaining NSL authority.\u201d Administration\u2019s Draft AntiTerrorism Act of 2001: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on the Judiciary,\n107th Cong. 57\u201358 (2001). In view of the statutory presumption about\nacting officials and this indication of congressional intent to expand the\n154 Authority of Acting FBI Officials to Sign National Security Letters class of officials who may issue NSLs, we think that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2709, 12\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3414, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681u permit Acting Special Agents in\nCharge to sign NSLs. 6\nDANIEL L. KOFFSKY\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel It might be argued that Acting Deputy Assistant Directors and Acting Special Agents\nin Charge should not be permitted to issue NSLs under the NSL statutes because the\nDirector could designate relatively low-level employees to serve in these roles. See 136\nCong. Rec. 35,806, 35,817 (Oct. 26, 1990) (statement of Sen. Boren) (introducing\namendment to NSL statutes that \u201cadds the requirement that the Director\u2019s designee be of\nat least the rank of Deputy Assistant Director . . . due, in part, to the finding that critical\ndecisions [concerning NSLs] were made at low levels at FBI Headquarters\u201d). We do not\nthink this possibility undermines our interpretation of the NSL statutes.",

Congress vested\nthe authority to issue NSLs in Deputy Assistant Directors and Special Agents in Charge\ndesignated by the Director, and there is no indication of congressional intent to preclude\nissuance of NSLs by officials acting in these positions. Moreover, as the FBI Memorandum notes (at pages 1 and 7), the Director selects permanent and acting Deputy Assistant\nDirectors and Special Agents in Charge from the same pool of FBI employees (special\nagents and members of the FBI Senior Executive Service). This practice further supports\nthe view that the issuance of NSLs by Acting Deputy Assistant Directors and Special\nAgents in Charge should not raise any special concern under the NSL statutes. 6 155",
