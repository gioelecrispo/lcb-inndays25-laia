February 29, 2008 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE DIRECTOR\nOFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (\u201cEIGA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 95-521, 92 Stat.\n1824 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. app., EIGA \u00a7\u00a7 101\u2013111, 401\u2013408, 501\u2013\n505 (2000 & Supp. V 2005)), established the Office of Government Ethics\n(\u201cOGE\u201d) and charged it with developing and implementing ethics policies for the\nExecutive Branch. You have asked whether the Smithsonian Institution and its\npersonnel (the \u201cSmithsonian\u201d or \u201cInstitution\u201d) are subject to OGE\u2019s authority to\nadminister the Executive Branch ethics program. 1 We conclude that they are not. I.\nWith limited exceptions not applicable here, OGE\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to an entity outside the Executive Branch. The text and structure of EIGA\nunmistakably support this conclusion. EIGA clearly indicates that the Executive Branch is the focus of OGE\u2019s jurisdiction. EIGA establishes a tripartite structure for the federal government\u2019s ethics\nprogram that tracks the Constitution\u2019s three-branch structure. Title I of EIGA,\nwhich governs financial disclosure requirements for federal officials and employees, creates a separate \u201csupervising ethics office\u201d for each of the three branches. It\nspecifies that OGE is the \u201csupervising ethics office . . . for all executive branch\nofficers and employees,\u201d 5 U.S.C. app., EIGA \u00a7 109(18), and authorizes its\nDirector (along with certain agency officials) to administer financial disclosure\nrequirements for Executive Branch officials and employees, id. \u00a7 111(1). EIGA\nprovides that the ethics committees in the Senate and House of Representatives\nperform those functions for members of Congress, \u201cofficers and employees\u201d of the\ntwo houses, and \u201cemployees of the legislative branch,\u201d id. \u00a7 109(18)(A), (B); id.\n\u00a7 111(2); and the Judicial Conference does so \u201cfor judicial officers and judicial\n1\nSee Letter for Steven G. Bradbury, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel,\nfrom Robert I. Cusick, Director, Office of Government Ethics (Apr. 26, 2007) (\u201cOGE Letter\u201d). We also\nhave received the views of the Smithsonian Institution. See Letter for John P. Elwood, Deputy\nAssistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, from John E. Huerta, General Counsel,\nSmithsonian Institution (May 11, 2007) (\u201cSmithsonian Letter\u201d). 56 Office of Government Ethics Jurisdiction Over the Smithsonian Institution employees,\u201d id. \u00a7 109(18)(C); id. \u00a7 111(3). Title V of EIGA, which imposes\nrestrictions on outside sources of income or employment by high-level federal\nemployees, distributes administrative and regulatory authority in the same manner;\nOGE is directed to issue rules and regulations to implement its provisions \u201cwith\nrespect to officers and employees of the executive branch.\u201d Id. \u00a7 503(2). EIGA directs OGE to develop and implement ethics policies for the Executive\nBranch. Title IV of EIGA, which constitutes OGE\u2019s \u201corganic law,\u201d OGE Letter\nat 2, authorizes OGE\u2019s Director to \u201cprovide . . . overall direction of executive\nbranch policies related to preventing conflicts of interest on the part of officers and\nemployees of any executive agency.\u201d Id. \u00a7 402(a).",

The Director\u2019s duties include,\namong other things, developing rules and regulations to address conflicts of\ninterest and ethics in the Executive Branch, id. \u00a7 402(b)(1)\u2013(2), monitoring\nExecutive Branch compliance with financial disclosure and reporting requirements, id. \u00a7 402(b)(3)\u2013(5), and ensuring that executive agencies develop and\nimplement appropriate ethics rules, id. \u00a7 402(c)\u2013(f). Other authorities also direct OGE to oversee Executive Branch ethics programs. Sections 7351 and 7353 of title 5 of the United States Code authorize OGE to\nimplement statutory restrictions on gifts to federal employees and gifts from federal\nemployees to their superiors by issuing regulations \u201cfor all executive branch officers\nand employees.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7351(c), 7353(b), (d) (2000 & Supp. V 2005). And the\nPresident has delegated OGE authority under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301 (2000) to \u201cprescribe\nregulations for the conduct of employees in the executive branch.\u201d Exec. Order No.\n12731, \u00a7 403, 3 C.F.R. 306, 310 (1990 Comp.). Thus, the authorities that created\nOGE and articulate its jurisdiction and responsibilities make clear that, with limited\nexceptions not implicated here, OGE supervises only entities and employees in the\n\u201cexecutive branch.\u201d 2 The term \u201cexecutive branch\u201d is defined for purposes of title I of EIGA as follows: For the purposes of this title, the term . . . \u201cexecutive branch\u201d includes each Executive agency (as defined in section 105 of title 5,\nUnited States Code), other than the Government Accountability Office, and any other entity or administrative unit in the executive\nbranch . . . . 2\nUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(b)(2) and (d)(2) (2000), OGE is authorized to issue regulations exempting\nemployees from a criminal conflict of interest statute that applies to \u201can officer or employee of the\nexecutive branch of the United States Government, or of any independent agency of the United States,\na Federal Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee of the District of\nColumbia, including a special Government employee.\u201d Id. \u00a7 208(a). You have not asked us to consider\nany issues regarding the application of section 208 to the Smithsonian or the extent of OGE\u2019s authority\nunder that provision. See OGE Letter at 2 n.1. 57 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 32 5 U.S.C. app., EIGA \u00a7 109. OGE has adopted a similar definition in its regulations\nimplementing title IV:\nExecutive branch includes each executive agency as defined in 5\nU.S.C. 105 and any other entity or administrative unit in the executive branch. However, it does not include any agency, entity, office\nor commission that is defined by or referred to in 5 U.S.C. app.\n109(8)\u2013(11) of the Act as within the judicial or legislative branch. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2638.104 (2006); see also 5 U.S.C. app., EIGA \u00a7 109(8)\u2013(11) (defining\nthe terms \u201cjudicial employee,\u201d \u201cJudicial Conference,\u201d \u201cjudicial officer,\u201d and\n\u201clegislative branch\u201d).",

We see no reason to believe that Congress intended that the\nterm would have another meaning under the other authorities providing OGE with\njurisdiction over \u201cexecutive branch\u201d officers and employees. See Enfield ex rel. Enfield v. A.B. Chance Co., 228 F.3d 1245, 1251 (10th Cir. 2000) (\u201cIt is a well\nrecognized rule of statutory construction used to determine legislative intent that\nordinarily identical words or terms used in different statutes on a specific subject\nare interpreted to have the same meaning in the absence of anything in the context\nto indicate that a different meaning was intended.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). The definition of \u201cexecutive branch\u201d set forth in title I provides that the term\n\u201cincludes each Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105.\u201d Section 105\u2019s\ndefinition is also referenced in title IV of the Act. See 5 U.S.C. app., EIGA\n\u00a7 402(a) (stating that the Director shall provide \u201coverall direction of executive\nbranch policies\u201d related to preventing conflicts of interest on the part of \u201cofficers\nand employees of any executive agency, as defined in section 105 of title 5, United\nStates Code\u201d); cf. Exec. Order No. 12731, \u00a7 503(c), 3 C.F.R. at 310 (\u201c\u2018Agency\u2019\nmeans any executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105 . . . .\u201d). 3 The clear focus of\nsection 105 is on Executive Branch entities: \u201can Executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 105 (2000). All\n\u201cExecutive department[s]\u201d are within the Executive Branch. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n(2006); see also Haddon v. Walters, 43 F.3d 1488, 1490 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (referencing the \u201cexclusive list of Executive departments\u201d in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 101). Similarly,\nthe term \u201cindependent establishment\u201d is defined as \u201c(1) an establishment in the\nexecutive branch,\u201d and \u201c(2) the Government Accountability Office.\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 104 (2006). The definitions in both title I of EIGA and the regulations implementing title IV, however, explicitly exclude from their reach the Government\nAccountability Office, which is a Legislative Branch agency, see Bowsher v.\nSynar, 478 U.S. 714, 730\u201332 (1986). While the definition of \u201cGovernment\n3 The term \u201cExecutive agency\u201d itself plainly suggests agencies within the Executive Branch. Although the term does encompass at least one agency in the Legislative Branch\u2014the Government\nAccountability Office\u2014it does so only by virtue of an explicit statutory provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(2)\n(Supp. V 2005), that tends to underscore that GAO would not otherwise come within the scope of the\nterm. 58 Office of Government Ethics Jurisdiction Over the Smithsonian Institution corporation\u201d in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 (2000) is not necessarily limited to Executive\nBranch entities, this Office has opined that the Smithsonian is not a \u201cGovernment\ncorporation\u201d for purposes of a similar definition of \u201cagency\u201d under the Freedom of\nInformation Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)(1) (2000).",

Moreover, the phrase \u201cexecutive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105\u201d in section\n109 is followed by the catch-all phrase \u201cany other entity or administrative unit in\nthe executive branch,\u201d confirming that Congress understood the term \u201cExecutive\nagency\u201d to be within that category. The D.C. Circuit applied this principle, which\nit termed \u201creverse ejusdem generis,\u201d in a similar context. Construing the definition\nof \u201cagency\u201d within the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a (2000 & Supp. V 2005)\u2014\n\u201cany executive department, military department, Government corporation,\nGovernment controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch\nof the Government,\u201d id. \u00a7 552(f)(1) (2000)\u2014the court held that the phrase applied\nonly to establishments in the Executive Branch. Dong, 125 F.3d at 879\u201380. The\ncourt reasoned, \u201cCongress evidently viewed the four specified classes as examples\nof \u2018establishments in the executive branch,\u2019 so that an entity clearly outside the\nexecutive branch would not qualify even if it could otherwise be shoehorned into\nthe concept of a \u2018Government controlled corporation.\u2019\u201d Id. at 879. This Office\nfound that argument compelling in construing the same definition in the Ulman\nMemorandum, where we stated that the argument \u201clend[s] considerable credence\nto the contention that an authority must be within the Executive branch in order to\nbe covered by\u201d the Privacy Act. Id. at 4\u20135. We therefore conclude that, with limited exceptions not applicable here, OGE\u2019s\njurisdiction does not extend to an entity outside the Executive Branch, regardless\nof whether that entity otherwise meets the definition of \u201cexecutive agency\u201d found\nin 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 105. 59 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 32 II.

It would also run afoul of\nthe Incompatibility Clause, which forbids members of Congress from holding \u201cany\nOffice under the United States.\u201d Id. art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 2.\nMoreover, the President exercises no control over the Smithsonian and has no\npower to remove its board members. See Dong, 125 F.3d at 879 (\u201c[T]here is no\nevidence that the Secretary of the Smithsonian answers to the President . . . .\u201d);\nUlman Memorandum at 5 (Smithsonian is \u201cunder no executive power of control or\nappointment whatever\u201d). Instead, Congress presumably retains the ability to\nremove those members it appoints. See generally President\u2019s Removal Power at 3\n(\u201c[T]he fundamental principle applicable in removal cases is that, absent contrary\nindications, the power to appoint implies the power to remove.\u201d). Indeed, Congress did remove and replace a board member at least once in the Smithsonian\u2019s\nhistory. See Act of Feb. 21, 1863, Pub. Res. No. 37-21, 12 Stat. 825 (removing and\nreplacing a Board member for \u201cgiving aid and comfort to\u201d the Confederacy). If the\nSmithsonian were in the Executive Branch, the President\u2019s inability to supervise\nits operation through removal of its Board members, and Congress\u2019s authority\nover the Institution, would implicate fundamental separation of powers principles. Dong, 125 F.3d at 879; see generally Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 726, 730. Finally, structural and functional aspects of EIGA indicate that the Smithsonian\nis not part of the Executive Branch for purposes of the Act. As noted above, OGE\nis the supervising ethics office for the Executive Branch, while the Legislative and\nJudicial Branches have their own supervising ethics offices. Members of Congress\nand the Chief Justice fill seven of the positions on the Institution\u2019s Board of\nRegents. If the Smithsonian fell within OGE\u2019s jurisdiction, OGE would exercise\nauthority over members of Congress and the Chief Justice in their capacity as\nRegents. Moreover, OGE\u2019s ability to conduct its ethics programs under title IV of\nEIGA ultimately relies on the President\u2019s authority to supervise the Executive\nBranch. OGE\u2019s Director is required to monitor compliance with EIGA\u2019s requirements and may order an agency or its employees under OGE\u2019s jurisdiction to take\ncorrective action when necessary. 5 U.S.C. app., EIGA \u00a7 402(b)(9).",

Id. \u00a7 402(f)(1)(B), (f)(2)(A)(ii)\u2013(iv),\n(f)(3)(B). Those notification provisions would make little sense if applied to\nentities and persons, such as the Smithsonian and its board members, over which\nthe President has no removal or disciplinary authority. See S. Rep. No. 100-392, at\n16 (1988) (report on reauthorization of OGE) (\u201c[I]n the final analysis, the OGE\nDirector\u2019s enforcement authority lies with his or her powers of persuasion and\nability to appeal to the President and the public.\u201d) (emphasis added). 62 Office of Government Ethics Jurisdiction Over the Smithsonian Institution While the Smithsonian\u2019s place in the taxonomy of government may not be\nentirely clear, it is certainly not within the Executive Branch for purposes of\nEIGA. 4 See Status of GPO and Smithsonian at 2 (\u201cThe Smithsonian Institution is\nnot within the Executive branch of the Government.\u201d); Ulman Memorandum at 5\n(\u201cIt is readily apparent that the Smithsonian, . . . under no executive power of\ncontrol or appointment whatever, is not within the Executive branch.\u201d). Therefore,\nwe conclude that OGE\u2019s authority to administer the Executive Branch ethics\nprogram does not extend to the Smithsonian. III. Our conclusion that OGE does not supervise the Smithsonian under EIGA is\nconsistent with longstanding practice. Before EIGA\u2019s passage, standards of ethical\nconduct for Executive Branch employees were governed by Executive Order\n11222, 3 C.F.R. 130 (1965 Supp.). That order outlined rules relating to conflicts of\ninterest, outside employment, receipt of gifts, and financial disclosure, to be\nadministered by agency heads and the Civil Service Commission. The Institution\nfirst adopted standards of conduct in October 1961. Smithsonian Letter at 2. Shortly after issuance of the Executive Order, the Smithsonian issued revised\nstandards \u201c[p]ursuant to and in conformity with sections 201 through 209 of the\nUnited States Code, Executive Order 11222,\u201d and the regulations implementing\nthe order, \u201cset[ting] forth minimum standards of conduct\u201d for Smithsonian\nemployees. Smithsonian Institution Standards of Conduct, 31 Fed. Reg. 4512\n(Mar. 17, 1966). Those regulations were published annually in the Code of Federal\nRegulations. See 36 C.F.R. pt. 500 (1966\u20131983). Shortly after Congress enacted EIGA, the Smithsonian sought OGE\u2019s opinion\nabout whether its board members and employees were subject to the financial\ndisclosure requirements of EIGA. OGE concluded that, because the Smithsonian\nwas not in the Executive Branch, EIGA\u2019s disclosure requirements for Executive\nBranch employees did not apply. Memorandum for Peter G. Powers, General\nCounsel, Smithsonian Institution, from Bernhardt K. Wruble, Director, Office of\n4 We do not address whether the Smithsonian might be deemed part of the federal government or an\nexecutive agency for other statutory purposes.

In a 1988 opinion, for example, this Office concluded\nthat the Smithsonian was an \u201cexecutive agency\u201d for purposes of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (\u201cProperty Act\u201d). The Status of the Smithsonian Institution under the Federal\nProperty and Administrative Services Act, 12 Op. O.L.C. 122 (1988). That determination rested on the\nProperty Act\u2019s particular legislative history. Section 201(c) of the Property Act, which granted\nauthority to \u201cany executive agency,\u201d replaced an earlier statute that had explicitly covered the\nSmithsonian. Because the legislative history of section 201(c) indicated that it was meant to \u201cpreserve\nall . . . existing authority,\u201d we concluded that the Smithsonian was included within its reach. Id. at 126\n(quotation marks omitted). By contrast, there is no indication that the Executive Branch ethics program\nthat existed before EIGA was meant to encompass the Smithsonian. See Exec. Order No. 11222,\n3 C.F.R. 130 (1965 Supp.); see generally S. Rep. No. 95-170, at 28\u201331 (1977) (describing the ethics\nprogram that existed before EIGA). 63 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 32 Government Ethics, Re: Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (Apr. 13, 1979). OGE\ninformally reaffirmed that conclusion in 1990, see OGE Letter at 6, and continues\nto abide by it today. Thus, during the thirty years since enactment of EIGA, OGE\nhas not asserted jurisdiction over the Smithsonian or its personnel. OGE has not\nsought\u2014nor has the Smithsonian submitted\u2014an annual ethics program report, as\nrequired of executive agencies under 5 U.S.C. app., EIGA \u00a7 402(e). Nor has the\nSmithsonian sought OGE\u2019s guidance in resolving ethics questions. See OGE Letter\nat 6\u20137; Smithsonian Letter at 1. Following the passage of EIGA, the Smithsonian continued to publish its own\nethics regulations, which did not refer to OGE or EIGA. The Institution ceased to\npublish the regulations in 1984. The Smithsonian\u2019s General Counsel explained:\nThe Smithsonian Institution is not a government agency as that term\nis traditionally used, but for a number of years the Standards of Conduct for Smithsonian employees . . . have been published in the format of government agency regulations as Part 500 . . . of Title 36 of\nthe Code of Federal Regulations. Part 500 . . . [is] obsolete and [is]\nbeing removed from Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Henceforth, in keeping with the Institution\u2019s status, current Standards of Conduct for Smithsonian employees . . . will be promulgated internally . . . .\n49 Fed. Reg. 9171 (Mar. 12, 1984); see also Smithsonian Institution, Smithsonian\nDirective 103, Smithsonian Institution Standards of Conduct (Feb. 13, 2006)\n(current ethics standards). Since then, Congress has amended EIGA and reauthorized OGE without modifying the definitions of \u201cexecutive branch\u201d or \u201cexecutive agency,\u201d and without\ntaking other action to bring the Smithsonian within OGE\u2019s jurisdiction.",
