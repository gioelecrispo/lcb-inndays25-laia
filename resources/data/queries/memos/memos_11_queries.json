Although you have not inquired as to the\napplicability of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(c), we conclude that, while the provision would\napparently apply to the carrier\u2019s transmission of such location information to pub\u00ad\nlic safety organizations, the caller, by dialing 911, has impliedly consented to\nsuch disclosure, thus permitting the federal government to require the carrier to\ndisclose such information without a warrant or court order.

F acts In its recently issued rule regarding Compatibility of Wireless Services With\nEnhanced 911 ( \u201c E-911\u201d ), the Federal Communications Commission (the \u201c FCC\u201d )\nestablished a timetable for the development and deployment of new technologies\nthrough which wireless carriers (cellular telephone companies) will automatically\nprovide a designated public safety answering point (\u201c PSAP\u201d ) 2 with information\nregarding the physical location of a caller who dials 911 on a wireless cellular\ntelephone. Commercial Mobile Radio Services, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a720.3, 20.18 (1996). 3 This information will significantly enhance the effectiveness of wireless 911 serv\u00ad\nices by helping emergency service personnel locate the caller and more rapidly\nand accurately determine where the emergency has occurred. The implementation and deployment of enhanced 911 features and functions\nwill be accomplished in two phases. In phase one, covered carriers must relay\nto the PSAP the 911 caller\u2019s telephone number and the location of the cell site\nor base station through which the call originates. See id. \u00a720.18(d). This informa\u00ad\ntion will identify the caller\u2019s location only in quite general terms,4 but will enable\nemergency service providers to call back if a 911 call is disconnected. See id. We understand that the information provided in phase one is currently available\nto wireless carriers, as it is regularly captured by them as part of their transmission\nof calls from cellular phones,5 but some carriers must develop the ability to pass\nit on to a third party. A more precise identification of the caller\u2019s location will occur in phase two,\nwhen the carrier must provide the designated PSAP with the physical location\nof the mobile unit making the call by longitude and latitude within a radius of\n125 meters in 67% of all cases. See id. \u00a7 20.18(e). According to FCC representa\u00ad\ntives, the more precise location determination required in phase two will occur\n2 A public safety answering point is a facility designated to receive 911 calls and route them to emergency service\npersonnel. See A l C.F.R. \u00a720.3. 3 An E -9 11 system automatically identifies on a screen at the PSAP the telephone num ber and geographical location\nfrom which the call was made. This system permits a more efficient response to calls received, mcluding silent\ncalls, and deters false alarms, because such calls are capable o f being traced. In many jurisdictions, E-911 systems\nare already operational for landline phones, identifying the telephone num ber and the address associated with that\ntelephone number. The address o f the subscriber to the cellular telephone will often be insufficient to identify the\nc aller\u2019s physical location at the time of a call, however, because cellular telephones are mobile and calls are frequently\nmade from som eplace other than the c aller\u2019s address. The need for this critical information regarding the location\no f the caller was the impetus for the new F C C rule. 4The physical size o f a cell depends upon the density o f use: it could encompass only a few blocks in a populated\ncity, or m iles in a rural area.",

A MIN is a 34-bit binary number\nthat a cellular handset transm its as part o f the process o f identifying itself to wireless networks.

A caller\u2019s signal, and its strength, are already\noften picked up by more than one cell site. In addition, many cell sites have\nsectorized antennas, and, depending upon the angle of the signal\u2019s arrival, a par\u00ad\nticular antenna will pick up the signal, thus informing the carrier what sector of\nthe cell the caller is located in. Finally, each site records the arrival time of a\nsignal. By developing new computer programs, switching technology, protocols\nand network architecture, the carrier will be able to combine and analyze all of\nthis information\u2014 the strength of the signal at each of the cell sites picking up\nthe signal, the sector of a cell from which a signal emanates, and the time that\nit takes for the signal to arrive at one cell site compared to other sites\u2014 to identify\nmore precisely the caller\u2019s location. B. Relevant Statutory Provisions\nThe Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994\n(\u201c CALEA\u201d ), among other things, requires telecommunications carriers to ensure\nthat their equipment is capable of permitting the government (pursuant to a court\norder or other lawful authorization) to access certain \u201c call-identifying informa\u00ad\ntion\u201d 6 that is reasonably available to the carrier. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a)(2). CALEA\nincludes limitations, however, and specifically prohibits telecommunications car\u00ad\nriers from providing the government with \u201c information acquired solely pursuant\nto the authority for pen registers and trap and trace devices (as defined in section\n3127 of title 18) . . . that may disclose the physical location of the subscriber\n(except to the extent that the location may be determined from the telephone num\u00ad\nber).\u201d Id. \u00a7 1002(a)(2)(B).7 Section 3127 of title 18 (part of the Electronic Com\u00ad\nmunications Privacy Act of 1986 (\u201c ECPA\u201d )) in turn prohibits the installation\nor use of pen registers and trap and trace devices absent a court order, with the\nexception of particular uses by providers of electronic or wire communication\nservices.",

The caller is the source of the loca\u00ad\ntion information needed by the government to respond, and his call evidences\nnot merely an expectation, but in fact a purpose, of conveying that information\nto the authorities. If the caller himself does not tell the authorities where he is\nlocated (which he generally does), it is presumably due to the exigent cir\u00ad\ncumstances resulting from the emergency, and not to any desire to withhold such\ninformation. Even if the emergency is in a different location, his decision to reach\nout to government officials to seek their help indicates that he would similarly\ntell them his location if it would help them respond to the emergency. 13 The\nmere possibility that a caller subjectively does not wish his location to be revealed\nwould not negate the consent presumed from his making the 911 call. 14\nC.

The second question is\n\u201c whether the individual\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy is \u2018one that society\nis prepared to recognize as \u201c reasonable,\u201d \u2019 \u201d \u2014 whether \u201c the individual\u2019s expec\u00ad\ntation, viewed objectively, is \u2018justifiable\u2019 under the circumstances.\u201d Id. (quoting\nKatz, 389 U.S. at 361 (Harlan, J., concurring), 353). In our opinion, a cellular caller dialing the 911 emergency line has not exhibited\nan \u201c actual (subjective) expectation of privacy\u201d in information regarding his phys\u00ad\nical location, much less a \u201c reasonable\u201d one. It is hard to imagine any clearer\nindication of the absence of an expectation of privacy than a cry for help; by\nreaching out to government officials to seek their help, the caller indicates that\nhe has no expectation of privacy in information that could help the authorities\nrespond to the emergency. 15\nEven assuming that, in some number of cases, the caller actually expects his\nphysical location to remain private, we believe that expectation is not \u201c one that\nsociety is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d Katz, 389 U.S. at 361. A caller\ndialing 911 seeking assistance cannot reasonably expect that information regarding\nhis location will remain private when public service organizations need such infor\u00ad\nmation first and foremost to expeditiously provide the emergency assistance re\u00ad\nquested by the caller, and secondly to ensure that the call is legitimate and thus\nworthy of response. 16 In addition, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a person has no expecta\u00ad\ntion of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties. 17 In order\nto complete his call, the cellular caller must convey his signal and its cor\u00ad\nresponding cell site location to the carrier. The caller therefore has no reasonable\n13 Although no court has directly addressed this issue, our conclusion is supported by cases holding that a person\ncalling 911 has no expectation o f privacy in the contents o f his call.",

Instead, there is an expectation that the information provided will be recorded and dis\u00ad\nclosed to the public.\u201d State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Hamilton County, Ohio, 662 N.E.2d 334, 337 (O hio\n1996) (tape recordings o f 911 calls are public records that are not exempt from disclosure and must be immediately\nreleased upon request); see also State v.

Van Poyck, 77 F.3d 285, 290-91 (9th Cir.) (prisoner has no reasonable expectation of\nprivacy in outbound calls), cert, denied , 519 U.S. 912 (1996); People v. Suite, 161 Cal. Rptr. 825, 829 (Cal.

And\nit is the strength of this same signal \u2014 information voluntarily turned over by the\ncaller to a third party\u2014 that would be measured from different antennas and cell\nsites, and then analyzed in phase two in order more precisely to determine his\nlocation. An expectation of privacy simply is not \u201cjustified\u201d in these cir\u00ad\ncumstances. In sum, because a cellular caller dialing 911 has no actual or reasonable expecta\u00ad\ntion of privacy as to information regarding his physical location, there will be\nno \u201c search\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and thus no con\u00ad\nstraints imposed by the Fourth Amendment, when wireless carriers transmit such\ninformation to public safety authorities.",

C ellular C allers Dialing 911 Have Impliedly Consented to the Transmission\no f Information Regarding Their Physical Location\nEven assuming that the provision to public safety agencies of information re\u00ad\ngarding the physical location of a cellular caller dialing 911 would constitute a\nsearch within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, that search would be lawful\nif the caller consented to it, as consent is \u201c one of the specifically established\nexceptions to the requirements of both a warrant and probable cause.\u201d Schneckloth\nv. Bustam onte, 412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973). As set forth above, we believe that\ndialing 911 evidences such consent. Consent to a warrantless search can be explicit or can be implied from conduct. The Seventh Circuit recently reviewed the caselaw on implied consent, summa\u00ad\nrizing the pertinent analysis as follows:\nGenerally, in deciding whether to uphold a warrantless search on\nthe basis of implied consent, courts consider whether (1) the person\nsearched was on notice that undertaking certain conduct, like at\u00ad\ntempting to enter a building or board an airplane, would subject\nhim to a search, (2) the person voluntarily engaged in the specified\nconduct, (3) the search was justified by a \u2018vital interest\u2019, (4) the\nsearch was reasonably effective in securing the interests at stake,\n(5) the search was only as intrusive as necessary to further the inter\u00ad\nests justifying the search and (6) the search curtailed, to some ex\u00ad\ntent, unbridled discretion in the searching officers. M cGann v. N ortheast III. Regional Commuter R.R., 8 F.3d 1174, 1181 (7th Cir. 1993) (citations omitted).18\n18 44W e decline to regard these six factors as dispositive criteria. Rather, these factors should be examined carefully\nin each case in evaluating the totality o f the circumstances and in respecting the consideration that the courts not\nunnecessarily extend exceptions to the warrant requirem ent.\" Id. at 1181. See also Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 322 Transmission by a Wireless Carrier o f Information Regarding a Cellular Phone U ser\u2019s Physical\nLocation to Public Safety Organizations Applying this analysis to the \u201c search\u201d here at issue leads us to conclude that\na person using his cellular telephone to call 911 impliedly consents to the carrier\nproviding public safety officials with information as to his physical location. Al\u00ad\nmost all, if not all, of the above-enumerated factors will be satisfied. The caller\nwill have voluntarily called 911; the search will be justified by a vital interest\nin responding to an emergency and should be quite effective in facilitating that\nresponse; and the search will be limited to determining the caller\u2019s physical loca\u00ad\ntion, and thus will be only as intrusive as necessary to respond quickly and effi\u00ad\nciently to the emergency and should minimize any risk of unbridled discretion\nby officers. The only factor possibly raising a question would be the first. In\nmost instances, a person calling 911 will be doing so to obtain help for himself\nor someone in his immediate vicinity, and thus he will undoubtedly be \u201c on no\u00ad\ntice\u201d that calling 911 will entail disclosure of his location.",
