T he INS can exercise this enforcem ent authority against persons and entities within all three branches\no f the federal governm ent in a m anner consistent with the C onstitution. March 15, 2000\nM em orandum O p in io n I m m ig r a t i o n and fo r th e G en era l C o u n sel N a t u r a l iz a t io n S e r v ic e You have requested our advice as to whether section 274A of the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (\u201c INA\u201d ), which establishes employer verification require\u00ad\nments and authorizes the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201c INS\u201d ) to take\nenforcement action against employers for failure to comply with those require\u00ad\nments, can be applied to federal government entities, in light of the possible con\u00ad\nstitutional concerns that such enforcement action might raise. As we explain more\nfully below, we believe that section 274A clearly contemplates the imposition\nof employer sanctions against federal government entities. Moreover, with respect\nto employers within all three branches, we conclude that the INS can exercise\nits authority to take enforcement actions against such persons or entities consistent\nwith the Constitution. BACKGROUND Section 274A of the INA provides for the assessment of civil monetary penalties\nand cease and desist orders against any \u201c person or other entity\u201d who has know\u00ad\ningly hired, or knowingly continued to employ, any unauthorized alien or who\nhas failed to comply with the employment verification system mandated by section\n274A(b).' 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1324a(e)(4Me)(5) (1994 & Supp. II 1996). As used in\nsection 274A, the term \u201c entity\u201d includes \u201c an entity in any branch of the Federal\nGovernment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1324a(a)(7). The INS has the authority to investigate complaints of potential violations of\nsection 274A by inspecting employment eligibility verification forms maintained\nby employers and compelling the production of evidence or the attendance of\nwitnesses by subpoena. Id. \u00a7 1324a(e)(2). If, based upon such an investigation,\nthe INS determines that an employer has violated section 274A, it serves a Notice\n1 Criminal penalties and injunctive relief may also be imposed against persons or entities engaged in a \u201c pattern\nor practice o f violations\u201d of section 274A. See 8 U.S C. \u00a7 1324a(f)( 1M 2 ) 33 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 24 o f Intent to Fine ( \u201c NTF\u201d ) on the employer. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.9 (1998).

      "content": "o f Intent to Fine ( \u201c NTF\u201d ) on the employer. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.9 (1998). An employer\nserved with a NIF may request an evidentiary hearing before an Administrative\nLaw Judge ( \u201c ALJ\u201d ). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(e)(3). If the employer does not request\na hearing, the NIF becomes a final, unappealable order, id.\\ if a hearing is\nrequested, the ALJ\u2019s subsequent decision and order become the final decision and\norder of the Attorney General, unless a reviewing official or the Attorney General\nherself modifies or vacates the order, pursuant to regulations. See id. \u00a7 1324a(e)(7). Section 274A also provides for judicial review and judicial enforcement of final\norders. Under section 274A(e)(8), \u201c [a] person or entity adversely affected by a\nfinal order respecting an assessment may, within 45 days after the date the final\norder is issued, file a petition in the Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit\nfor review of the order.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(e)(8). If a person or entity refuses\nto comply with any final order, the statute provides that \u201c the Attorney General\nshall file a suit to seek compliance with the order in any appropriate district court\nof the United States.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1324a(e)(9). DISCUSSION As noted above, section 274A authorizes the INS to assess civil monetary pen\u00ad\nalties against any \u201c person or other entity\u201d that violates the employment\nverification provisions of that section. Section 274A(a)(7) provides: \u201c For purposes\nof this section, the term \u2018entity\u2019 includes an entity in any branch of the Federal\nGovernment.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(a)(7). We must first determine whether Congress intended to authorize the INS to\nassess administrative penalties and otherwise bring enforcement proceedings\nagainst governmental employers. A straightforward reading of the statutory text\nleads us to conclude that that was clearly Congress\u2019s intent. Prior to passage of\nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n( \u201c IIRIRA\u201d ), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, section 274A contained\nno provision defining the scope of the term \u201c entity.\u201d In fact, this Office deter\u00ad\nmined in 1992 that the absence at that time of any definition of the phrase \u201c person\nor other entity\u201d from the INA, together with the lack of evidence that Congress\nintended the phrase to include federal agencies, precluded application of the term\n\u201c entity\u201d to a federal government agency in the context of the employer antidiscrimination provision of section 274B. See Enforcement Jurisdiction o f the Spe\u00ad\ncial Counsel fo r Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices, 16 Op.\nO.L.C. 121, 123-24 (1992). In 1996, Congress amended section 274A to make clear that the term \u201c entity\u201d\ndid apply to federal government entities. Section 412(d) of IIRIRA added new\nsubparagraph 274A(a)(7) to the INA:\n34 Enforcement o f INA Employer Sanctions Provisions Against Federal Government Entities \u201c Application to Federal Government \u2014 For purposes of this sec\u00ad\ntion, the term \u2018entity\u2019 includes an entity in any branch of the Fed\u00ad\neral Government.\u201d\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(a)(7). We believe the language of that provision is manifest:\nfor purposes of section 274A, the term \u201c entity\u201d applies to all federal government\nemployers, including agencies within the executive, judicial and legislative\nbranches.",

The House Conference Report accompanying IIRIRA confirms our\nreading of section 412(d): \u201c This provision clarifies that the Federal government\nmust comply with section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act . . . .\u201d\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104\u2014828, at 237 (1996). The plain text of the statute, together\nwith its legislative history, thus leaves no question as to Congress\u2019s intent that\nfederal government entities be covered by section 274A, including the investiga\u00ad\ntion, assessment and enforcement provisions of section 274A(e). Having concluded that Congress intended to authorize the INS to assess civil\npenalties and bring enforcement actions against other governmental employers,\nwe further conclude that the INS can exercise that authority consistent with the\nConstitution. Because different constitutional issues are raised by INS enforcement\nof section 274A against executive agencies, the judiciary, and Congress, we will\nseparately address application of the statute to each branch. Enforcement Actions Against Executive Branch Agencies The President has authority under Article II of the Constitution to supervise\nthe executive branch, which includes the authority to resolve disputes within that\nbranch. Authorizing the INS to assess civil penalties against other agencies does\nnot give rise to a constitutional problem under Article II. The critical point is\nthat the INA \u201c does not preclude the President from authorizing any process he\nchooses to resolve disputes between [the INS] and other federal agencies regarding\nthe assessment of administrative penalties.\u201d Administrative Assessment o f Civil\nPenalties Against Federal Agencies Under the Clean A ir Act, 21 Op. O.L.C. 109,\n116 (1997) (\u201c EPA Opinion\u201d ). Under section 274A, any agency that disputes an\nINS assessment has the opportunity to voice its objections in an administrative\nhearing before an ALJ, whose decision is subject to review by the Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral or her delegate. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(e)(7). There is no limitation in the statute\non the President\u2019s authority to review the matter if he chooses to do so, and the\nabsence of any such restriction on his discretion is dispositive. EPA Opinion, 21\nOp. O.L.C. at 116. In the context of one federal executive agency assessing civil penalties against\nanother, the statutory provision of judicial procedures to enforce those penalties\nalso might be thought to raise constitutional concerns related to the Article III\nlimitation on the jurisdiction of the federal courts to actual cases and controversies. 35 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 24 The civil action provisions contained in sections 274A(e)(8) and (9) might be\nconstrued to suggest that one executive branch agency may sue another in federal\ncourt over an administrative penalty. This Office has consistently held that \u201c \u2018law\u00ad\nsuits between two federal agencies are not generally justiciable.\u2019 \u201d EPA Opinion,\n21 Op.

Federal courts may adjudicate only actual cases and controversies, and\na lawsuit involving the same party as both plaintiff and defendant \u2014 which would\ngenerally be the result if one executive agency sued another \u2014 does not constitute\nan actual controversy. However, in practice, such a scenario would not arise, for the internal executive\nbranch dispute-resolution process described above would either obviate the need\nfor a final administrative order or preclude noncompliance with such an order. In the event o f any dispute between INS and another executive agency as to a\ncivil penalty assessment, the President, as head of the executive branch, has the\nauthority either to direct the Attorney General not to impose a final order or to\norder the agency to comply with such an order. In either case, the judicial review\nprovisions of sections 274A(e)(8) and (9) simply would not be triggered. 2\nEnforcement Actions Against the Judiciary As noted above, the definition o f \u201c person or other entity\u201d applies to the judicial\nbranch, as well as to the legislative and executive branches. Application of section\n274A to the judiciary raises questions concerning the possible assertion of judicial\nimmunity. W e do not believe that any plausible claim of judicial immunity from section\n274A could be made in the wake of Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219 (1988). In F orrester, the Supreme Court concluded that questions regarding the scope\no f absolute judicial immunity must be evaluated in light of the purposes served\nby such immunity. Id. at 226-27. That \u201c functional approach\u201d looks at the nature\no f the official functions exercised and evaluates \u201c the effect that exposure to par\u00ad\nticular forms of liability would likely have on the appropriate exercise of those\nfunctions.\u201d Id. at 224. The Court in Forrester applied the functional approach\nto reject a judge\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from civil liability for his decision\nto demote and discharge a probation officer. In doing so, the Court distinguished\nbetween \u201cjudicial acts\u201d and \u201c the administrative, legislative, or executive func\u00ad\ntions that judges may on occasion be assigned by law to perform.\u201d Id. at 227. It reasoned that, with respect to the latter category, the danger of \u201c officials\u2019 being\ndeflected from the effective performance o f their duties\u201d was not substantial\nenough to warrant absolute immunity. Id. at 230. The Court held that administra\u00ad\n2 Indeed, the Executive Branch has various procedures in place to avoid litigation and promote internal dispute\nresolution See, e g , Exec.

Forrester's holding makes clear that personnel decisions such as those that are\nthe subject of section 274A enforcement actions do not warrant absolute judicial\nimmunity. Such actions fall into the category of \u201c administrative, legislative, or\nexecutive functions\u201d that a judge might perform, rather than \u201cjudicial acts\u201d that\nmerit the protection offered by absolute immunity. Nor do we see any separation of powers problem with executive enforcement\nof section 274A against the judiciary. The Supreme Court has made clear that\nnot all interactions between the judiciary and the executive branches, even those\nthat might be categorized as \u201c quite burdensome,\u201d are necessarily constitutionally\nforbidden. Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 702 (1997). It is only where the burden\nimposed by one branch is so onerous as to \u201c impair another in the performance\nof its constitutional duties\u201d that the general separation of powers principle is vio\u00ad\nlated. Id. at 701 (citing Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748 (1996)). Although\nan enforcement action under section 274A would impose some administrative bur\u00ad\ndens upon its subject \u2014 to the extent, for example, that it required compliance\nwith subpoenas issued or cooperation with investigative efforts \u2014 such burdens\nwould certainly not be so demanding as to interfere with the judiciary\u2019s proper\nexecution of its constitutional obligations. See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S.\n361, 409 (1989) (President\u2019s appointment and removal power over federal Sen\u00ad\ntencing Commission does not \u201c prevent[], even potentially, the Judicial Branch\nfrom performing its constitutionally assigned functions\u201d ). Indeed, in the context of criminal law enforcement, courts have consistently\nupheld the power of the executive branch to prosecute sitting judges, notwith\u00ad\nstanding the more significant intrusion upon the judiciary occasioned by such\nenforcement, and have rejected the judges\u2019 claims that such executive action\nundermines judicial autonomy. See, e.g., United States v. Claiborne, 727 F.2d\n842, 8 4 5 ^ 9 (9th Cir. 1984); United States v. Hastings, 681 F.2d 706, 709-11\n(11th Cir. 1982); United States v. Isaacs, 493 F.2d 1124, 1 1 4 2 ^4 (7th Cir.), cert,\ndenied, 417 U.S. 976 (1974). As the court in Hastings explained in rejecting a\nrule that would have granted sitting federal judges immunity from criminal\nprosecution: \u201c [T]he minuscule increment in judicial independence that might be\nderived from the proposed rule would be outweighed by the tremendous harm\nthat the rule would cause to another treasured value of our constitutional system:\nno man in this country is so high that he is above the law.\u201d 681 F.2d at 711. If executive enforcement of the criminal laws against the judiciary (which could\ninclude indictment, prosecution, and imprisonment of a sitting judge) does not\nundermine judicial independence, we cannot say that the comparatively negligible\nintrusion upon the judiciary that might be occasioned by executive enforcement\nof section 274A is a threat to judicial autonomy. 37 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 24 Enforcement Actions A gainst Congress",

The more significant question is whether\nenforcement actions may be initiated against Members of Congress or congres\u00ad\nsional offices consistent with the legislative immunity accorded by the Speech\nor Debate Clause of the Constitution. 3 The Speech or Debate Clause provides\nthat, \u201c for any Speech or Debate in either House, [Senators and Representatives]\nshall not be questioned in any other Place.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a76, cl. 1.\nIn interpreting the Speech or Debate Clause, the Supreme Court has not confined\nits protections literally to \u201c Speech or Debate in either House\u201d but has given it\n\u201c a practical rather than a strictly literal reading which would limit the protection\nto utterances made within the four walls of either Chamber.\u201d Hutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. I l l , 124 (1979). Thus, in United States v. Johnson , 383 U.S.\n169 (1966), the Court foreclosed prosecution of a Member of the House of Rep\u00ad\nresentatives for allegedly taking a bribe in return for delivering a speech on the\nfloor of the House. The indictment necessarily focused upon both Johnson\u2019s\nmotives in making the speech and the contents of the speech itself, and the Court\nconcluded that the Congressman\u2019s motive \u201c is precisely what the Speech or Debate\nClause generally forecloses from executive and judicial inquiry.\u201d Id. at 180. In\nholding Johnson immune from prosecution under the Speech or Debate Clause,\nhowever, the Court emphasized that its holding was limited to the facts before\nit, and reserved the question whether Speech or Debate immunity would preclude\n\u201c a prosecution which, though as here founded on a criminal statute of general\napplication, does not draw in question the legislative acts of the defendant member\nof Congress or his motives for performing them.\u201d Id. at 185. Six years later, in United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501 (1972), the Supreme\nCourt resolved that question by holding that Speech or Debate immunity did not\nbar prosecution of a member of Congress for soliciting and receiving sums of\nmoney in return for \u2018 \u2018official acts performed by him in respect to his action, vote\nand decision\u201d on proposed postal rate legislation, where the Member could\nsuccessfully be prosecuted without inquiry into either legislative acts or their moti\u00ad\nvation: The question is whether it is necessary to inquire into how\nappellee spoke, how he debated, how he voted, or anything he did\nin the chamber or in committee in order to make out a violation\n3 With respect to the applicability o f section 274A against Congress, we will here address only the general question\no f the availability o f speech and debate immunity W e do not address the more specific question of who the proper\ndefendant may be in individual enforcement actions.",

The illegal conduct is taking or agreeing to take\nmoney for a promise to act in a certain way. There is no need\nfor the Government to show that appellee fulfilled the alleged\nillegal bargain; acceptance of the bribe is the violation of the\nstatute, not performance of the illegal promise. Taking a bribe is, obviously, no part of the legislative process\nor function; it is not a legislative act. . . . Nor is inquiry into a\nlegislative act or the motivation for a legislative act necessary to\na prosecution under this statute or this indictment. Id. at 526. Accordingly, the Court in Brewster confirmed that the Clause does not protect\nall conduct relating in any way to the legislative process, but is \u201c limited to an\nact which was clearly a part of the legislative process \u2014 the due functioning of\nthe process.\u201d Id. at 515-16 (emphasis in original). Proper attention to the history\nand purposes of the Clause, including the underlying separation of powers con\u00ad\ncerns, did not justify a broader reading: We would not think it sound or wise, simply out of an abundance\nof caution to doubly insure legislative independence, to extend the\nprivilege beyond its intended scope, its literal language, and its his\u00ad\ntory, to include all things in any way related to the legislative\nprocess. Given such a sweeping reading, we have no doubt that\nthere are few activities in which a legislator engages that he would\nbe unable somehow to \u201c relate\u201d to the legislative process. Id. at 516. The Court further clarified the proper scope of the Speech or Debate Clause\nin Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972), decided the same day as\nBrewster. Senator Gravel made copies of the Pentagon Papers part of the public\nrecord of a meeting of the Senate subcommittee that he chaired.

The Court began its analysis by noting that simply because \u201c Senators generally\nperform certain acts in their official capacity as Senators does not necessarily\nmake all such acts legislative in nature.\u201d Id. at 625. It then explained:\nThe heart of the Clause is speech or debate in either House. Insofar\nas the Clause is construed to reach other matters, they must be an\nintegral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by\nwhich Members participate in committee and House proceedings\nwith respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of pro\u00ad\nposed legislation or with respect to other matters which the Con\u00ad\nstitution places within the jurisdiction o f either House. Id. The hearings were complete and the record of the hearings was available. Subsequent publication of the Pentagon Papers by a nonprofit press was neither\nrequested nor authorized by the Senate and \u2018 \u2018was in no way essential to the delib\u00ad\nerations of the Senate.\u201d Id. Because questioning regarding that publication did\nnot \u201c threaten the integrity or independence of the Senate by impermissibly\nexposing its deliberations to executive influence,\u201d the Court determined that this\nconduct was not protected by the Speech or Debate Clause. Id. Although the Supreme Court has thus delineated the general scope of Speech\nor Debate immunity, it has not yet resolved the question of its applicability to\nemployment-related decisions.

Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979), the\nCourt specifically reserved the question whether a Congressman\u2019s allegedly\ndiscriminatory decision to fire his administrative assistant was shielded by the\nclause. Id. at 236 n .l l , 248-49. Two courts of appeals, however, have addressed\nthis issue. In the original panel decision in D avis,5 the Fifth Circuit determined that the\nSpeech or Debate Clause did not protect a Congressman from a suit by a former\naide who alleged that the Congressman unconstitutionally discriminated against\nher on the basis of her sex when he dismissed her. 544 F.2d 865, 878 (5th Cir.\n1977), r e v \u2019d on other grounds, 571 F.2d 793 (1978) (en banc), rev\u2019d, 442 U.S.\n228 (1979).

Reciting familiar passages from Gravel\nthat limit the scope of the clause to \u201c legislative acts,\u201d the panel concluded:\n[Representatives are not immune from inquiry into their decisions\nto dismiss staff members. Such dismissal decisions certainly are not\n\u201c an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes\nby which Members participate in committee and House proceedings\n. . . .\u201d [quoting Gravel, 408 U.S. at 625]. Peripheral or tangential\nactivities of a representative must not be confused with the legisla\u00ad\ntive core. . . . When members of Congress dismiss employees they\nare neither legislating nor formulating legislation. The fear of\njudicial inquiry into dismissal decisions cannot possibly affect a\nlegislator\u2019s decisions on matters pending before Congress. The\ndemocratic process remains unfettered.

The court, relying on\nGravel, asserted that:\nPersonnel decisions are an integral part of the legislative process\nto the same extent that the affected employee\u2019s duties are an\nintegral part of the legislative process. . . . Thus, if the employee\u2019s\nduties are an integral part of the legislative process, such that they\nare directly assisting members o f Congress in the \u201c discharge of\ntheir functions,\u201d personnel decisions affecting them are correspond\u00ad\ningly legislative and shielded from judicial scrutiny. Id. at 928-29 (citation omitted). Applying this standard, the court discussed at length the importance of the role of an Official Reporter in the communicative\nand deliberative processes of Congress, and concluded that such reporting was\n41 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 24 indeed an integral part of legislative functioning. Id. at 929-30. In coming to\nthis conclusion, the court pointed out that, in order to resolve Browning\u2019s claims,\nthe judiciary\nwould necessarily have to inquire about matters at the very heart\nof the legislative process, such as the nature of the hearings to\nwhich Browning was assigned, the purposes underlying those\nhearings, and whether Browning\u2019s performance frustrated those pur\u00ad\nposes. Id. at 930. There are two ways to read the decision in Browning. First, Browning could\nbe read for the proposition that, in determining whether Speech or Debate immu\u00ad\nnity attaches to any particular employment decision, the proper focus is whether\njudicial scrutiny of that decision would necessitate any inquiry into legislative\nconduct or motivations. If so, then the employment decision relates sufficiently\nto the legislative process to merit immunity. See id.; see also House of Representa\u00ad\ntives\u2019 Brief in Opposition to Petition for Certiorari, Browning v. Clerk, House\no f Representatives (No. 86-547), at 5. Alternatively, Browning could be read more\nbroadly, to suggest that the applicability of Speech or Debate immunity in the\nemployment context depends solely upon the nature of the employment at issue. If the employee\u2019s duties can be said to be an \u201c integral part of the legislative\nprocess,\u201d immunity attaches to any personnel decisions regarding that employee;\nif the employee\u2019s duties cannot be so characterized, it does not. Browning, 789\nF.2d at 929. While we acknowledge that there is language in Browning to support the second\nreading that focuses on employment duties, Supreme Court Speech and Debate\nprecedents, as well as the specific facts of Browning, compel our conclusion that\nthe decision must be read more narrowly. 6 Under G ravel and Brewster, the mere\n6 W e note too that there is some question w hether and how the Supreme C ourt\u2019s ruling in Forrester v.

T h e distinction that Forrester makes between \u201c judicial acts\u201d and\n\u201c the administrative, legislative, or executive functions that judges may occasionally be assigned by law to perform\u201d\nis based on the rationale that, with respect to the latter category, the danger of \u201c officials\u2019 being deflected from\nthe effective performance o f their duties\u201d is not substantial enough to warrant absolute immunity Forrester, 484\nU S. at 230. That rationale could be applied equally to the administrative functions of the legislative branch, such\nas hiring o f personnel, and verification that they are not unauthorized aliens. In the wake o f Forrester, the District of C olum bia Circuit, in Gross v Winter, 876 F 2 d 165 (D C . Cir. 1989),\napplied Forrester's functional approach in rejecting a D C. Council m ember\u2019s claim of legislative immunity for\nher allegedly discriminatory decision to fire a probation officer Gross recognized that \u201c [tjhe Supreme Court\u2019s strict\n\u2018functional\u2019 immunity analysis in Forrester . contrasts with the employee-centnc approach this court took in\nB row ning.\" Id at 171 The court found Forrester, not Browning, controlling' The functions o f probation officers and legislative aides are therefore equally important to the due func\u00ad\ntioning o f the judicial and legislative processes, respectively Nonetheless, under Forrester, the functions\njudges and legislators exercise in making personnel decisions affecting such employees are administrative,\nnot judicial or legislative. Forrester's functional approach also forecloses the somewhat curious logic that\nthe greater the em ployee\u2019s importance to the legislative process the greater should be the state legislator\u2019s\nfreedom to violate that em ployee\u2019s constitutional rights 42 Enforcement o f INA Employer Sanctions Provisions Against Federal Government Entities fact that an individual may have some duties that relate to core legislative proc\u00ad\nesses does not make all matters bearing on that person\u2019s employment \u201c an integral\npart of the deliberative and communicative processes by which Members partici\u00ad\npate in committee and House proceedings with respect to the consideration and\npassage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other matters which\nthe Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House.\u201d Gravel, 408 U.S.\nat 625. As the Court noted in Brewster, in a passage relied upon in Browning:\n\u201c The only reasonable reading of the Clause, consistent with its history and pur\u00ad\npose, is that it does not prohibit inquiry into activities that are casually or inciden\u00ad\ntally related to legislative affairs but not a part of the legislative process itself.\u201d Id. at 528, quoted in 789 F.2d at 927. Under that standard, even if a particular\nemployee\u2019s duties could be said to relate to the legislative process, there might\nbe any number of purely administrative decisions made with respect to that\nemployee that would have nothing to do with the employee\u2019s fulfillment of his\nor her duties and that therefore would not merit legislative immunity. 7",

      "content": "7 The Speech or Debate Clause arguably was implicated in Browning not because\nthe job of official reporter for the House of Representatives included duties that\nwere integral to the legislative process, 789 F.2d at 928, but because the disputed\nfactual issue in the employment claim was whether the reporter was fired for\npoor job performance or for racial reasons. Id. at 930. We believe that the more\nsweeping language in Browning must be read in light of those facts. The District\nof Columbia Circuit court concluded that the particular employment decision at\nissue in Browning presented a risk of judicial second-guessing of judgments \u201c at\nthe very heart of the legislative process.\u201d Id. at 930. Legislative immunity was\nwarranted in Browning, on the narrower view, because assessing the adequacy\nof Browning\u2019s job performance would have required the trial court to \u201c inquire\ninto matters at the very heart of the legislative process\u201d \u2014 such as the nature\nand purpose of the hearings to which Browning had been assigned. Id. In contrast, permitting the INS to enforce section 274A against Congress would\nnot, thwart any of the purposes underlying the Speech or Debate Clause, for\nId at 172 However, in applying Forrester to a case involving a D.C. Council member rather than a M ember of\nCongress, the court in Gross expressly noted that it was not reaching the question \u201c whether special considerations\napplicable to members of Congress, such as separation-of-powers concerns, continue to justify the absolute immunity\nstandard for congressional personnel decisions adopted in Brow ning.\" Id More recently, in United States v. Rostenkowski, 59 F.3d 1291, 1303 (D.C. Cir 1995), the District o f Columbia Circuit again reserved the question whether\nBrowning remained good law after Forrester, because the employees at issue lacked \u201c even the most tangential\nrelationship to the \u2018legislative process\u2019 \u201d and employment decisions respecting them thus could not be immunized\neven under the broadest reading of Browning. 7 The broader reading o f Browning is out of step not only with the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents, but also with\nthe District o f Columbia Circuit\u2019s own pnor law The Browning court appeared to misread an earlier decision, Walker\nv. Jones, 733 F.2d 923 (D.C Cir 1984), in which the court denied Speech or Debate Clause immunity to congres\u00ad\nsional defendants who dismissed a food service manager for allegedly discriminatory reasons Id at 931. Browning\ncited Walker as the genesis o f a standard focusing on the nature o f the em ployee\u2019s duties, and immunizing all\npersonnel decisions with respect to employees whose duties closely relate to the legislative process Id at 925. In fact, W alker\u2014 like Johnson, Brewster, and Gravel \u2014 properly focused directly on the legislator\u2019s actions, and\nconsidered the em ployee\u2019s duties only as potentially relevant to the question whether a personnel action regarding\nthat employee might implicate the legislator\u2019s motives Id 43 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 24 executive enforcement would not involve inquiry into legislative acts or the\nmotives for legislative acts.",

Nor would it \u201c threaten the integrity or independence\no f [Congress] by impermissibly exposing its deliberations to executive influence.\u201d Gravel, 408 U.S. at 625. Section 274A applies to the \u201c hiring, recruiting, or refer\u00ad\nring\u201d of individuals for employment in the United States, and requires employers\nto verify, by examining certain specified documents, that individuals being consid\u00ad\nered for employment are not unauthorized aliens. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(b), (b)(1). Once the employer has examined these documents, the employer must attest in\nwriting to the verification and must retain the verification form for future inspec\u00ad\ntion. Id. \u00a7 1324a(b)(l)(A), (b)(3). Any investigation by the INS as to whether an\nemployer has complied with these verification requirements or whether the\nemployer knowingly hired or continued to employ an unlawful alien thus would\nnot involve inquiry into the employee\u2019s duties or job performance. Rather, such\nan investigation would require examination of the verification form, and possibly\nthe circumstances surrounding the employer\u2019s execution of that form, including\nwhether the employer had complied in good faith with the attestation and docu\u00ad\nment retention requirements. Regardless of how integrally connected to the legisla\u00ad\ntive process the employee\u2019s duties might be, the actions of a Member of Congress,\nin complying with these verification requirements or in knowingly hiring an\nunlawful alien, could not be characterized as \u201c legislative acts,\u201d and any inquiry\ninto section 274A compliance would not reach such legislative acts or the motives\nunderlying them. The ministerial requirements imposed under section 274A are\nat most \u201c casually or incidentally related to legislative affairs.\u201d Brewster, 408 U.S.\nat 528. Like the conduct at issue in Brewster, knowingly hiring an unlawful alien\n\u201c is, obviously, no part of the legislative process or function; it is not a legislative\nact.\u201d Id. at 526. We therefore conclude that executive enforcement of section\n274A against legislative branch entities is not precluded by the Speech or Debate\nClause. CONCLUSION The plain language of section 274A makes clear that its enforcement provisions\napply to persons and entities within all three branches of the federal government. We conclude that the INS can exercise its enforcement authority under section\n274A against persons and entities within the executive, judicial, and legislative\nbranches in a manner consistent with the Constitution.
