Other interim designations\nwill expire thirty days after the en d of the current session o f the Senate. 2 Faced\nwith the prospect that a new marshal would not have entered into office by the ex\u00ad\npiration date o f som e o f the interim designations, the Attorney General issued or\u00ad\nders redesignating the same deputies as interim marshals and delegating to them\nauthority to act as m arshals. If this situation recurs, the Attorney General wishes to\npursue a sim ilar course, redesignating the same deputy marshal, or another deputy\nmarshal, to serve as interim marshal and delegating appropriate authority to that\nperson. N one o f the designees has been, or will have been, appointed a marshal by\nthe President, and refused advice and consent by the Senate. II. Section 562 grants the Attorney General authority, subject to specific eligibility\nlim itations, to \u201cdesignate a person to perform the functions o f and act as marshal\u201d\nwhen the office of marshal is vacant. W hile the marshal vacancy statute imposes\nlimits on the authority it grants to the Attorney General, the language of the statute\nis com patible with a grant of authority to make successive designations. 3 The stat\u00ad\nute does not explicitly bar the A ttorney General from issuing a new designation\nwhen a previous one expires. 4 W e hesitate to read such a limitation into the stat\u00ad\nute. Doing so could lead to serious gaps in the United States M arshals Service\u2019s\nlegal authority to perform its vital duties, including its \u201cprimary role and mission\u201d\no f \u201cprovid[ing] for the security\u201d o f the federal courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 566(a). For any\nnum ber o f reasons, a new marshal may not yet have taken office when an interim\nm arshal\u2019s designation expires. T he President may not have submitted a nominee to\nthe Senate; the Senate may fail to act on the nomination, or may reject it. If the Senate is in recess on the date an interim m arshal\u2019s designation terminates\nw ithout a new m arshal\u2019s having taken office, the President may exercise his con\u00ad\nstitutional authority to make a recess appointm ent to the vacant marshal position. 2 We interpret the phrase \"end of the next session o f the Senate,\u201d in 28 U S.C. \u00a7 562(b)(2), to have the\nsame meaning as the nearly identical phrase in the Recess Appointments Clause, U.S. Const, art.

It says little more than that \u00a7 562\n\u201cprovide[s] for the appointment of an Acting Marshal by the Attorney General\u201d and \u201calso assures the tempo\u00ad\nrary nature of such interim appointments . . by providing for the automatic termination of such interim\nappointm ents \u201d 134 Cong.

But the Senate will not necessarily be in recess on the\nthirtieth day following the end of its session, or following its refusal to give advice\nand consent to an appointment. In such circumstances, \u00a7 562, if construed as per\u00ad\nmitting only a single exercise of the authority to designate an interim marshal,\nwould provide no mechanism for conferring upon anyone the authority to perform\nthe functions of a marshal in a district where the m arshal\u2019s office is vacant. Such a\nconstruction would be contrary to the apparent purpose o f \u00a7 562, which is to pro\u00ad\nvide continuity in the performance of the m arshal\u2019s functions. W hile the courts have not addressed the issue o f successive interim designations\nunder the marshal vacancy statute, judicial interpretation of a statute governing\ninterim United States attorney appointments supports our analysis of \u00a7 562. Simi\u00ad\nlar to the marshal vacancy statute, the United States attorney vacancy statute\nauthorizes the Attorney General to \u201cappoint a United States attorney for the district\nin which the office . . . is vacant\u201d to serve for 120 days, or until the President fills\nthe office by appointment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 546.

On that view, because \u00a7 562 grants the\nAttorney G eneral m ore specific authority to address vacancies in United States\nm arshals\u2019 offices, the section must have meant to set forth the full extent o f the\nAttorney G eneral\u2019s authority in that area. It might also be argued that such a\nreading of \u00a7 562 is necessary to m ake the section\u2019s time limits on interim marshal\ndesignations m eaningful. Allowing the Attorney General to make potentially un\u00ad\nlimited delegations o f the authority to act as a marshal, such an argument might\nconclude, could displace the process o f appointm ent by the President and advice\nand consent by the Senate. The better view is not to read into \u00a7 562 such a limitation on the Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral\u2019s authority under \u00a7\u00a7 509 and 510. Section 562 establishes procedures and\ncriteria that the A ttorney General m ust follow if he wishes to designate a person to\nserve as an interim m arshal pursuant to the authority conferred by the marshal va\u00ad\ncancy statute. One need not, and should not, assume that \u00a7 562 provides the exclu\u00ad\nsive m eans by which the Attorney G eneral may delegate the authority to perform a\nm arshal\u2019s functions, or that \u00a7 562 displaces any additional legal authority that the\nAttorney General otherw ise would possess to address marshal vacancies. 8 Our\ninterpretation preserves a function fo r \u00a7 562 without requiring that it operate so as\nto interfere with law enforcement, co u rt security or the performance of other vital\nfunctions o f the m arshal\u2019s office. T his conclusion finds support in judicial interpretations of the Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral\u2019s authority to delegate under \u00a7\u00a7 509 and 510, and construction of those stat\u00ad\nutes in conjunction with m ore \u201cspecific\u201d statutes governing the Attorney G eneral\u2019s\nauthority to designate or appoint others to perform functions of the Department of\nJustice. See, e.g., In re Subpoena o f Persico, 522 F.2d 41, 54-55 (2d Cir. 1975)\n(Attorney General has authority to assign others to perform prosecutorial functions\n\u201cnot only under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 515 [authorizing specific designation], but also under\n. . . other statutes,\u201d including \u00a7\u00a7 509 and 510); In re G rand Jury Proceedings, 673\nF.

See, e g_, Memorandum for Rudolph W\nGiuliani, Associate Attorney General, from Ralph W Tarr, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of\nLegal Counsel (Dec. 30, 1982). 4 A u thority o f the A ttorney G eneral to M ake Successive D esignations o f Interim U nited States M arshals diminish Attorney G eneral\u2019s power, under \u00a7 509, to \u201cperform the functions of the\nM arshal\u201d or to delegate to another officer the m arshal\u2019s authority to remove deputy\nmarshals). 9\nIV. For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 562 authorizes the\nAttorney General (subject to the limitations the statute explicitly imposes) to des\u00ad\nignate a deputy marshal to serve as interim marshal upon the expiration o f his, or\nanother person\u2019s, prior designation as interim marshal in a judicial district where\nthe m arshal\u2019s office is vacant. We also conclude that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 509, 510\nauthorize the Attorney General to delegate the authority to perform the functions of\na United States marshal to a deputy marshal. We recommend that Attorney Gen\u00ad\neral Orders designating interim United States marshals recite, in an abundance of\ncaution, that the Attorney General acts pursuant to the authority granted by 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 5 0 9 ,5 1 0 , 562.\nJOHN C.

An earlier OLC opinion suggested that \u00a7 510 gave the Attorney General authority to\nmake interim appointments to vacant U.S attorney positions, but not necessarily to vacant U.S. marshal\npositions. That opinion stressed that a marshal was principally \u201can officer of the court,\u201d that a statute\nauthorized district courts to make interim marshal appointments, and that marshals (including interim ap\u00ad\npointees in vacant posts) had to give a personal bond to guarantee proper handling of funds Memorandum\nfor Lawrence E Walsh, Deputy Attorney General, from Robert Kramer, Assistant Attorney General, Office\no f Legal Counsel at 3 (Oct 21, 1959) Those factors have changed' marshals now have substantial investi\u00ad\ngatory and law enforcement duties, 28 U.S C \u00a7 566, the current marshal vacancy statute does not give courts\ninterim appointment power (while the U.S attorney vacancy statute now does, see, supra note 6), and mar\u00ad\nshals are no longer required to give personal bonds. 5",
