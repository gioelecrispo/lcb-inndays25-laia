October 8, 2019 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT You have asked whether the President may direct independent regulatory agencies to comply with the centralized regulatory review process of\nExecutive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, 3 C.F.R. 638 (1994) (\u201cEO\n12866\u201d). EO 12866 requires all agencies to submit an annual regulatory\nplan and agenda to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs\n(\u201cOIRA\u201d) in the Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d). But it\nexempts \u201cindependent regulatory agencies,\u201d as defined in 44 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3502, from the rest of the order, which requires agencies to submit\nsignificant regulatory actions to OIRA for review. OMB has proposed that\nthe President eliminate that exemption and require independent regulatory\nagencies to comply with all of EO 12866. 1\nArticle II of the Constitution vests \u201c[t]he executive Power\u201d in the President, who \u201cshall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d U.S.\nConst. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 1; id. \u00a7 3. By vesting the executive power in the\nPresident alone, the Constitution ensures that \u201ca President chosen by the\nentire Nation oversee[s] the execution of the laws.\u201d Free Enter. Fund v.\nPub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 499 (2010). The President can hardly ensure that the laws are faithfully executed \u201cif he cannot\noversee the faithfulness of the officers who execute them.\u201d Id. at 484. The\nPresident\u2019s constitutional authority therefore extends to the supervision of\nall agencies that execute federal law, including so-called \u201cindependent\u201d\nagencies. Although the Supreme Court has held that Congress may insulate independent agencies to some degree from presidential supervision, the pro- 1 In preparing this opinion, we have solicited and considered the views of the Office of\nManagement and Budget. See Letter for Steven A. Engel, Assistant Attorney General,\nOffice of Legal Counsel, from Neomi Rao, Administrator, OIRA, and Mark Paoletta,\nGeneral Counsel, OMB (Mar. 7, 2018) (\u201cOMB Letter\u201d). 1 43 Op. O.L.C. __ (Oct. 8, 2019) posed executive action would not test any statutory limits. Congress has\noften provided that the heads of those agencies are removable only for\nparticular causes, such as \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in\noffice.\u201d E.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 41. But statutory restrictions on removal, standing alone, do not bar those agencies from complying with EO 12866;\nindeed, the terms of such good-cause restrictions presuppose that the\nPresident may supervise an agency head to ensure compliance with the\nduties of office and with principles of good governance. Other structural\nfeatures associated with independent agencies, such as multi-member\ngovernance, independent litigating authority, or open-meeting requirements, likewise do not preclude those agencies from complying with EO\n12866. We therefore conclude that the President may direct independent\nagencies to comply with EO 12866. I.\nEvery President since Nixon has required systematic review of some\nrulemakings to ensure that federal regulations \u201cachieve legislative goals\neffectively and efficiently\u201d and do not \u201cimpose unnecessary burdens.\u201d",

In a later memorandum to OMB, this\nOffice considered the scope of congressional authority to exempt independent agencies\nfrom regulatory review. See Memorandum for Preeta D. Bansal, General Counsel and\nSenior Policy Adviser, Office of Management and Budget, from David Barron, Acting\nAssistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Regulatory Review and Coordination for Independent Agencies at 11\u201317 (Sept. 3, 2009). We advised that \u201cwe certainly\ncannot rule out the possibility that precluding Presidential supervision in the context of a\nparticular statutory regime might transgress whatever minimum quantum of supervisory\nauthority is required under Morrison,\u201d id. at 16\u201317, but we declined to \u201cresolve definitively the difficult and unsettled constitutional and statutory questions raised\u201d by such a\nproposal, id. at 18. The Barron Memorandum cautioned that directing independent\nagencies under EO 12866 might be \u201clegally controversial\u201d and advised against any\n\u201cdefinitive conclusion\u201d absent a concrete examination of a particular agency\u2019s governing\nstatutes. Id. at 1. As discussed below in Part III, we do not believe that any of the features\ngenerally associated with agency independence would restrict a presidential direction for\nindependent agencies to comply with EO 12866. But under the terms of EO 12866 itself,\nif an agency (be it independent or otherwise) has a specific statutory provision that\nconflicts with the general directives under EO 12866, then that specific statutory provision will control. See EO 12866, \u00a7 9; infra Part IV. 11 43 Op. O.L.C. __ (Oct. 8, 2019) Marine Mammals (Oct. 9, 1981), 1 Pub. Papers of Pres. Ronald Reagan\n914, 914 (1981) (noting that a statute exempting certain rulemakings from\nEO 12291 \u201cshould not be read to infringe in any way on the President\u2019s\nconstitutional responsibility to supervise the Secretary of Commerce and\nthe Secretary of the Interior in their execution of the law\u201d). EO 12866, however, conflicts with no statute. On the contrary, the order directs that the regulatory review process \u201cshall be conducted so as to\nmeet applicable statutory requirements.\u201d EO 12866, pmbl. An agency\nmust follow the order\u2019s overarching principles \u201cunless a statute requires\nanother regulatory approach,\u201d id. \u00a7 1(a), and several of its operative\nprovisions contain similar caveats.

EO 12866 also preserves the statutory discretion vested in the agency. In our 1981 opinion, we concluded that EO 12291 did \u201cnot purport wholly\nto displace, but only to guide and limit, discretion which Congress has\nallocated to a particular subordinate official.\u201d EO 12291 Opinion, 5 Op.\nO.L.C. at 61. So too, EO 12866 channels an agency\u2019s discretion by requiring the agency to follow the President\u2019s regulatory principles and to\nsubmit the proposed rule for OIRA\u2019s review. However, nothing in the\norder \u201cshall be construed as displacing the agencies\u2019 authority or responsibilities, as authorized by law.\u201d EO 12866, \u00a7 9.",

L.

This is\nconsistent with the President\u2019s constitutional supervisory authority under\nArticle II, which may not be delegated. See Centralizing Border Control\n12 Extending Regulatory Review to Independent Regulatory Agencies Policy Under the Supervision of the Attorney General, 26 Op. O.L.C. 22,\n24\u201325 (2002); cf. Free Enter.

At the same time, the President \u201cmay tap advisers within the\nWhite House\u201d (and within agencies) to assist him in implementing presidential policies within the Executive Branch. Centralizing Border Control\nPolicy, 26 Op. O.L.C. at 26. EO 12866 designates OIRA to coordinate\nand implement regulatory policy, while ensuring that agencies retain the\nauthority provided by the laws enacted by Congress, under the ultimate\nsupervision of the President. III. The President\u2019s constitutional authority to direct traditional executive\nagencies under EO 12866 also extends to the \u201cindependent regulatory\nagenc[ies]\u201d identified in 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(5). All of those agencies remain part of the Executive Branch and subject to his superintendence. Although Congress has sought to limit the President\u2019s authority to remove\nthe heads of some of those agencies, such limits on removal do not preclude the President from requiring the agencies to comply with EO 12866. Nor do the other hallmarks of agency \u201cindependence,\u201d such as multimember governance, independent litigating authority, or open-meeting\nrequirements. The President has long required independent regulatory\nagencies to submit an annual regulatory plan and agenda under section 4\nof EO 12866. Congress has not otherwise sought to shield such agencies,\nas a general matter, from complying with the order\u2019s other requirements,\nand we see no persuasive grounds to infer such an unstated limitation on\nthe President\u2019s supervisory authority.

The Supreme Court has confirmed that the President must have some\nconstitutional authority to remove all those executive officers whom he\nappoints, including the heads of independent agencies. See Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 493 (\u201cAs we explained in Myers, the President . . . must\nhave some \u2018power of removing those for whom he can not continue to be\nresponsible.\u2019\u201d).

United States, 295 U.S. 602, 629 (1935). But\neven the authority to remove an official for statutorily identified causes\n\u201cpresupposes that the officer or body that has the removal power must\nsupervise the subordinate officer at least to the extent needed to determine\nwhether \u2018cause\u2019 for removal exists.\u201d Applicability of Executive Order\n12674 to Personnel of Regional Fishery Management Councils, 17 Op.\nO.L.C. 150, 156 n.19 (1993); see also Morrison, 487 U.S. at 692\u201393\n(stating that the power to terminate an independent counsel for good cause\nallowed \u201cample authority to assure that the counsel is competently performing his or her statutory responsibilities in a manner that comports\nwith the provisions of the Act\u201d).

These principles led us to conclude in 1981 that President Reagan could\nhave applied EO 12291 to independent agencies. See Simms Memorandum at 10\u201312; supra Part I. We acknowledged that Congress often \u201cintends the independent agencies to be free of Presidential supervision on\n10 Indeed, that commonsense conclusion also follows from the Court\u2019s recognition that\n\u201c[t]he object of the constitution was to establish three great departments of government;\nthe legislative, the executive, and the judicial departments.\u201d Martin v. Hunter\u2019s Lessee,\n14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 329 (1816). During the Washington Administration, the Justices\nof the Supreme Court embraced that same understanding, advising that th e Opinions\nClause \u201cseems to have been purposely as well as expressly limited to executive Departments,\u201d thereby implicitly excluding the judicial department.

With only three \u201cgreat departments\u201d to choose from, it is apparent that independent\nagencies that execute federal law are part of the \u201cexecutive Departments\u201d and subject to\nthe Opinions Clause. We note that the ratification history of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment\nmay suggest a different reading for the \u201cprincipal officers of the executive departments\u201d\nmentioned there, but the 1967 ratification of that amendment does not illuminate the\noriginal meaning of Article II.

See 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 902(a)(3); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(b)(1)(A) (requiring that the\nSSA\u2019s budget \u201cbe submitted by the President to the Congress without\nrevision\u201d). Our file memorandum recording this informal advice noted\nthat the removal restriction, if valid, might limit the extent to which the\nPresident could \u201corder[] the [SSA Commissioner] to take a particular\nsubstantive policy position\u201d in a proposed action submitted for review\nunder section 6 of EO 12866. Memorandum for the Files, Re: OMB Review of Regulations of the Social Security Administration at 5 (Aug. 7,\n1995). But the President could nonetheless \u201ctell the SSA to submit the\nproposed rule to OIRA, because that [directive] . . . would not displace the\nSSA\u2019s ultimate discretion to promulgate regulations it considers appropriate.\u201d Id. at 7. We noted that permitting at least that degree of supervision\n\u201cmay in fact be constitutionally compelled\u201d under Article II. Id. Consistent with this Office\u2019s advice, EO 12866 continued to apply to the SSA,\nwhich we understand has participated in the regulatory review process in\nthe years since. That history confirms that the presidential supervision\nunder EO 12866 is consistent with statutory tenure protection. See also\nsupra p. 6 (noting that President Clinton\u2019s legal advisers concluded that\nEO 12866 could be applied to independent regulatory agencies). Thus, in the past, we have advised that both EO 12291 and EO 12866\ncould have been applied to independent agencies. Such advice is consistent with our long-standing view that the President \u201cmay exercise a\ncertain amount of managerial authority\u201d over independent agencies and\n\u201cunder penalty of removal \u2018may exact reasonable efficiency and absolute\nintegrity\u2019\u201d from independent agencies.

Requiring an agency to comply with EO 12866 would not\nconflict with those statutes, which do not preclude, and indeed presume,\nongoing presidential supervision of the agency. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Humphrey\u2019s Executor serves as the\nfoundation for any argument to the contrary. In Humphrey\u2019s Executor,\nthe Court addressed whether Congress could prohibit the removal without\ncause of members of the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). In contrast\nwith a \u201cpurely executive\u201d officer, such as the postmaster whose job was at\nissue in Myers, Humphrey\u2019s Executor concluded that the FTC exercised\nwhat it described as \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d and \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d functions,\n295 U.S. at 629, and the Constitution did not grant the President an \u201cillimitable power of removal\u201d over such officers. Id.; see also Wiener, 357\nU.S. at 353\u201354 (interpreting a statute to provide tenure protection to\nmembers of the War Claims Commission, an agency with adjudicative\nfunctions). In the course of upholding the lawfulness of such a restriction, the\nCourt in Humphrey\u2019s Executor spoke in sweeping terms about the congressional intent underlying the FTC Act: Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Office of Financial Research,\nand the SEC.

We cannot read Humphrey\u2019s Executor so broadly. To begin with, the\nquoted passage is dictum. As then-Professor Kagan explained, the \u201cquestion actually decided in the case was much narrower\u201d than its reasoning,\nand \u201cthe Court did not hold that Congress could cut off agencies in all\nrespects from the President.\u201d Kagan, Presidential Administration, 114\nHarv.

Thus, the President\u2019s authority over the officers of the FTC\ncontinues well beyond the time of selection. The same is true of any\nindependent agency whose head or heads are removable by the President\nfor cause. 21 43 Op. O.L.C. __ (Oct. 8, 2019) Humphrey\u2019s Executor also rested on an \u201coutmoded view\u201d of independent agencies as apolitical experts. Simms Memorandum at 10. \u201c[I]ndependent agencies . . . have to make a slew of non-scientific legal and\npolicy judgments\u2014such as how to interpret governing statutes, how to\nexercise policy discretion under those statutes, and whom to charge for\nviolations of the law.\u201d Aiken County, 645 F.3d at 442 n.2 (Kavanaugh, J.,\nconcurring). Indeed, \u201c[i]t is now recognized that rulemaking may legitimately reflect political influences of certain kinds from a number of\nsources, including Congress and the affected public.\u201d Simms Memorandum at 10. It thus makes little sense to presume that Congress intended to\ndivorce such agencies entirely from presidential supervision. In the decades since Humphrey\u2019s Executor, Congress itself has ensured\nthat independent agencies are not \u201cindependent of executive authority.\u201d\n295 U.S. at 625. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, Congress has\nrequired independent agencies to submit proposed information requests\nto OIRA for review. 44 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3502(1), 3507(a), (f ). Under the Congressional Review Act, independent agencies must submit \u201cmajor rules\u201d\nto Congress before the rules \u201ccan take effect.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801(a)(1)(A),\n804(1). Consistent with EO 12866, the statute requires OIRA to review\nthese regulations and determine whether they are \u201cmajor\u201d under the\nstatute. Id. \u00a7 804(2). Congress has also required independent agencies to\ncomply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, see id. \u00a7 601(1), and the\nData Quality Act, see Pub. L. No. 106-554, div. C, \u00a7 515, 114 Stat. 2763,\n2763A-153 to -154 (2000)\u2014the latter of which charged OMB with issuing guidelines to all agencies to ensure data quality and integrity. Accordingly, over the past 80 years, Congress has repeatedly confirmed that\nindependent agencies are part of the Executive Branch and subject to\n\u201cexecutive authority.\u201d For these reasons, we do not believe that the vision of independence\nsuggested by Humphrey\u2019s Executor accurately describes the current state\nof the law. At the same time, we acknowledge that the Court has suggested on occasion that removal restrictions provide an agency head with\nsome measure of independence from the President. See Free Enter.

We therefore conclude\nthat a for-cause limitation on removal does not preclude the President\n13 Other decisions of the Supreme Court have suggested a broader concept of what\nconstitutes \u201ccause\u201d for removal under particular statutes.

Our Office too has\nfavored the broader understanding, in large part to avoid constitutional concerns. See,\ne.g., Separation of Powers, 20 Op.

Those mechanisms include fixed terms in office for the agency\nhead, distinct from the President\u2019s term; composition as a multi-member\nbipartisan board with staggered terms of office; the authority to submit\ntestimony or proposed budgets to Congress without OMB review; and\nindependent litigating authority. See Marshall J. Breger & Gary J. Edles,\nIndependent Agencies in the United States 93\u201395, 163\u2013175 (2015); Kirti\nDatla & Richard L. Revesz, Deconstructing Independent Agencies (and\nExecutive Agencies), 98 Cornell L. Rev. 769, 789\u2013808 (2013); David E.\nLewis & Jennifer L. Selin, Sourcebook of United States Executive Agencies 88\u2013106 (2d ed. Oct. 2018). Those features are not universally shared\nby all the independent regulatory agencies in 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3502(5), nor are\nthey unique to those agencies. But they are common enough that we\nconsider here whether any would conflict with the centralized review\nprocess of EO 12866. We conclude that they do not. 1. Multi-member, Bipartisan Agency Governance. The statutes structuring some independent regulatory agencies as multi-member boards,\nwith staggered terms and bipartisan membership, do not limit the President\u2019s authority to require those agencies to comply with EO 12866. See,\ne.g., 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a)(2)(A) (establishing the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission as \u201can independent agency of the United States Government\u201d composed of \u201cfive Commissioners,\u201d \u201c[n]ot more than three of\n[whom] shall be members of the same political party,\u201d each serving \u201ca\nterm of five years\u201d expiring at staggered one-year intervals); 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 78d(a) (similar provisions for the SEC). Requiring an independent\nregulatory agency to submit its proposed rules to OIRA for review is\nconsistent with those structural features. The SEC, for example, will\ncontinue to be headed by a five-member, bipartisan board as required by\nstatute, whether or not the President directs the Commission to comply\nwith EO 12866. One might argue that Congress chose to delegate rulemaking authority\nto an agency headed by a multi-member, bipartisan board \u201cto minimize\n24 Extending Regulatory Review to Independent Regulatory Agencies presidential interference.\u201d EO 12291 Opinion, 5 O.L.C. Op. at 61. But we\nwould not overstate the degree of insulation. In most instances, the President retains the statutory authority to select the board\u2019s chair, ensuring\nthat he may put his stamp on the agency\u2019s policymaking agenda. 14 In\naddition, EO 12866 preserves an agency\u2019s ultimate discretion and thus\nrespects Congress\u2019s judgment to entrust particular rulemakings to a commission rather than a traditional executive agency. Subject to appropriate\nconsultation, the commission still makes the final decision under EO\n12866. We see no persuasive grounds to infer from the multi-member\nstructure of an independent regulatory agency any additional limits on\npresidential supervision that would bar the application of EO 12866 to the\nagency. 2. Independent Litigating Authority. For similar reasons, EO 12866\nwould not conflict with the authority of an agency to litigate independently of the Department of Justice when the agency has been given such\nauthority. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5564 (Bureau of Consumer Financial\nProtection (\u201cCFPB\u201d)).",

See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5564 (Bureau of Consumer Financial\nProtection (\u201cCFPB\u201d)). Such authority does not imply that there are any\nstatutory limits upon presidential supervision of agency rulemaking. EO\n12866\u2019s centralized review process applies only to regulatory actions that\npromulgate or are expected to lead to the promulgation of \u201ca final rule or\nregulation.\u201d EO 12866, \u00a7 3(e); supra note 2.

In fact, Congress has given\nCabinet departments independent litigating authority in limited circumstances, see, e.g., 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(e)(3)(B) (Department of Labor), yet\nthose agencies have long been subject to EO 12866. 3. OMB Bypass Authority. Congress has given some independent regulatory agencies the authority to bypass OMB by submitting reports, budgets, or testimony directly to Congress without prior OMB review. For the\nCFPB, for example, Congress provided that\n[n]o officer or agency of the United States shall have any authority\nto require the Director or any other officer of the Bureau to submit\nlegislative recommendations, or testimony or comments on legislation, to any officer or agency of the United States for approval,\ncomments, or review prior to the submission of such recommendations, testimony, or comments to the Congress[.]",

Although these statutes do not mention OMB by name, OMB has long\noperated the executive branch clearance processes that these statutes\nallow agencies to bypass. See OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation,\nSubmission, and Execution of the Budget (2017); OMB Circular No. A-19,\nLegislative Coordination and Clearance (1979). In other instances, Congress has effectively prohibited advance OMB review by directing that an\nindependent regulatory agency\u2019s budget requests, prepared testimony, or\nlegislative proposals be submitted concurrently to Congress whenever\nthey are submitted to OMB. See, e.g., 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a)(10)(A) (Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2076(k)(1) (Consumer Products Safety Commission); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7171( j) (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). The Executive Branch has long objected to efforts to minimize presidential supervision of the agencies in testifying and submitting proposed\nlegislation to Congress, treating those restrictions as an infringement of\nthe President\u2019s Article II authority, including his Article II, Section 3\n26 Extending Regulatory Review to Independent Regulatory Agencies authority to recommend to Congress \u201csuch Measures as he shall judge\nnecessary and expedient.\u201d See, e.g., Constitutionality of the Direct Reporting Requirement in Section 802(e)(1) of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, 32 Op. O.L.C. 27, 28\n(2008) (\u201cFor decades, the Executive Branch has consistently objected to\ndirect reporting requirements . . . on the ground that such requirements\ninfringe upon the President\u2019s constitutional supervisory authority over\nExecutive Branch subordinates and information.\u201d); Authority of the Special Counsel of the Merit Systems Protection Board to Litigate and Submit\nLegislation to Congress, 8 Op.

But even\nif these bypass statutes are constitutional, none of them speaks to OMB or\nOIRA review of an agency\u2019s proposed rulemakings; all of them apply\nonly to budget requests, to proposed legislation and testimony, or to some\ncombination thereof. Congress\u2019s decision to enact such bypass statutes is further evidence\nthat independent regulatory agencies are not, merely by virtue of tenure\nprotection, entirely free from presidential supervision (contra the dictum\nin Humphrey\u2019s Executor). Congress has expressly sought to limit OMB\u2019s\nauthority to coordinate the interagency clearance process in various respects, but has not imposed any statutory restrictions on OMB\u2019s authority\nto conduct regulatory review. This only underscores that Congress left the\nlatter untouched.",

This only underscores that Congress left the\nlatter untouched. We must presume that Congress \u201csays what it means and\nmeans what it says\u201d in these statutes. Simmons v. Himmelreich, 136 S. Ct.\n1843, 1848 (2016). By their plain terms, these statutes do not purport to\nforbid requiring independent regulatory agencies to participate in the EO\n12866 centralized review process. Congress has also required two agencies to submit certain financial operating plans and forecasts to OMB, but then provided in a \u201crule of con27 43 Op. O.L.C. __ (Oct. 8, 2019) struction\u201d that those requirements \u201cmay not be construed as implying\u201d\nthat OMB has \u201cany jurisdiction or oversight over the affairs or operations\u201d of the agencies. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1827(c)(3) (Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation); see also id. \u00a7 5497(a)(4)(E) (CFPB). By its own terms, that\nrule of construction simply precludes the inference that the agencies\u2019\nsubmission of required documents otherwise implies OMB supervision. The rule of construction, like OMB bypass statutes generally, does not\nspeak to or limit the President\u2019s authority under Article II to require an\nagency to participate in centralized regulatory review of the agency\u2019s\nproposed rulemakings. 4. Sunshine Act. Congress has required multi-member agencies to\ncomply with the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b, but\nthe requirements of that law do not preclude application of EO 12866. The Sunshine Act applies to any \u201cagency . . . headed by a collegial body\ncomposed of two or more individual members, a majority of whom are\nappointed to such position by the President with the advice and consent of\nthe Senate.\u201d Id. \u00a7 552b(a)(1). The Act requires that \u201cevery portion of\nevery meeting\u201d of such an agency \u201cbe open to public observation,\u201d subject to various exceptions, id. \u00a7 552b(b), and it defines a \u201cmeeting\u201d as\n\u201cthe deliberations of at least the number of individual agency members\nrequired to take action on behalf of the agency where such deliberations\ndetermine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official agency\nbusiness,\u201d id. \u00a7 552b(a)(2). The public is entitled to at least one week\u2019s\nadvance notice of any such meeting. Id. \u00a7 552b(e)(1). The Act\u2019s requirements do not apply to formal rulemakings, see id. \u00a7 552b(c)(10); Time,\nInc. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 667 F.2d 329, 334 (2d Cir. 1981), but there is no\ncomparable exception for informal rulemakings\u2014the kind of rulemakings\nto which EO 12866 applies, see EO 12866, \u00a7 3(d)(1). Thus, the Act requires covered agencies, such as the SEC and FTC, to meet in public\nwhenever a quorum of agency members convenes to engage in noticeand-comment rulemaking. The Sunshine Act\u2019s requirements would not preclude compliance with\nEO 12866, because most discussions between a covered agency and OIRA\nwould likely not qualify as a \u201cmeeting.\u201d As the Supreme Court explained\nin FCC v. ITT World Communications, Inc., 466 U.S. 463 (1984), Congress was cognizant in drafting the Sunshine Act that \u201cthe administrative\nprocess cannot be conducted entirely in the public eye.\u201d Id. at 469.",

The\nAct is therefore limited to \u201cmeetings\u201d as defined above. See id. at 471\n28 Extending Regulatory Review to Independent Regulatory Agencies (holding that a \u201cmeeting\u201d must involve deliberations \u201csufficiently focused\non discrete proposals or issues as to cause or be likely to cause the individual participating members to form reasonably firm positions\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Many of the consultations that occur in the\nEO 12866 process likely would not meet that standard. As the Court\nexplained, \u201c\u2018informal background discussions that clarify issues and\nexpose varying views\u2019 are a necessary part of an agency\u2019s work,\u201d and the\nAct was not intended to \u201cprevent such discussions.\u201d Id. at 469\u201370 (brackets omitted).

An exchange of views between OIRA and the staff\nof an agency (or its Chairman) during the EO 12866 process would not\nqualify. Thus, the Sunshine Act would be consistent with applying EO\n12866 to independent agencies. * * * * * We thus conclude that none of the common statutory hallmarks of independent agencies would stand in the way of applying EO 12866 to such\nagencies. Nothing in the centralized regulatory review process is inconsistent with their traditional \u201cindependence.\u201d EO 12866 expressly preserves the substantive rulemaking discretion afforded to independent\nagencies, just as it preserves the substantive discretion enjoyed by nonindependent agencies. It does so, however, within the framework of\npresidential supervision and OIRA administrative expertise that has\npromoted good administrative governance since the earliest days of the\nReagan Administration. Finally, we note that our conclusion is consistent with those of the Administrative Conference of the United States and the American Bar Association, both of which have long endorsed the President\u2019s authority to\nextend EO 12866 to independent agencies. 15 A 2017 report by the House 15 See, e.g., Section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice, ABA, Improving\nthe Administrative State: A Report to the President-Elect of the United States at 10\n(2016); Letter for Ron Johnson, Chairman, and Thomas R.

IV. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the President may require\nindependent regulatory agencies to comply with the centralized regulatory\nreview process prescribed by EO 12866. There is nothing in the statutory\ncomposition of independent agencies or in their other generally shared\nattributes that would preclude the full application of EO 12866 to them.

EO 12866\nexpressly contemplates, however, that it would yield to such a provision,\nand such a potential conflict would therefore pose no barrier to the general extension of EO 12866. Should an independent agency identify a specific statutory provision\nthat it believes requires modification of the processes and procedures of\nEO 12866, we would be happy to examine the matter. Please let us know\nif we may be of further assistance in that or in any other regard. STEVEN A. ENGEL\nAssistant Attorney General\nOffice of Legal Counsel 31",
