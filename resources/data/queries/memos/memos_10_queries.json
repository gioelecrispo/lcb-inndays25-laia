See Letter for Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General, Office\nof Legal Counsel, from Stephen D. Potts, Director, Office of Government Ethics\n(June 25, 1996) (\u201c Potts Letter\u201d )- We conclude that the statute forbids the rep\u00ad\nresentation. 1 While an attorney with the Navy\u2019s Military Sealift Command (\u201c MSC\u201d ), the\nformer employee represented the MSC in a case before the Federal Maritime Com\u00ad\nmission (\u201c FMC\u201d ), Government o f Guam v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., Docket No.\n89-26. He has now joined the law firm representing the Government of Guam\nin the case. He wishes to appear on behalf of Guam before the FMC and in any\nsubsequent judicial review proceedings. Section 207(a)(1) provides: Any person who is an officer or employee . . . of the executive\nbranch of the United States . . ., or of the District of Columbia,\nand who, after the termination of his or her service or employment\nwith the United States or the District of Columbia, knowingly\nmakes, with the intent to influence, any communication to or ap\u00ad\npearance before any officer or employee of any department, agency,\ncourt, or court-martial of the United States or the District of Colum\u00ad\nbia, on behalf of any other person (except the United States or the\nDistrict of Columbia) in connection with a particular matter\u2014\n(A) in which the United States . . . is a party or has a direct and\nsubstantial interest,\n1 Section 207(a)(1) covers a former em ployee\u2019s \u201c communication to or appearance before1' agencies and courts,\nmade \u201c w ith the intent to influence.\" Here, w e use forms o f the word \u201c represent\u201d as a shorthand, without meaning\nto specify the exact scope o f the statute. T here is no dispute in the present case that the former employee would\nbe engaged in \u201c co m m u n icatio n ^]\u201d and \u201d appearance[s] M within the meaning o f the law. 326 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 and the Government o f Guam (B) in which the person participated personally and substantially\nas such officer or employee, and\n(C) which involved a specific party or specific parties at the time\nof such participation,\nshall be punished as provided in section 216 of this title.",

Here, the former employee, while with the MSC, \u201c participated personally and\nsubstantially\u201d in the \u201c particular matter\u201d in question, which involves \u201c specific\nparties.\u201d See Potts Letter at 2. The former employee, however, makes two basic\narguments that the statute does not apply. First, he argues that Guam is not a\n\u201c person\u201d under \u00a7207 and that his representation is, therefore, not \u201c on behalf\nof any other person.\u201d See Memorandum for the Director, U.S. Office of Govern\u00ad\nment Ethics, from Former Employee, Re: Request fo r Advisory Opinion Con\u00ad\ncerning the Application o f 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1), at 3 (Feb. 26, 1996). Second,\nhe argues that his representation is not on behalf of a person \u201c except the United\nStates,\u201d because Guam is an instrumentality of the United States. Id. at 3-4. He\nmaintains, in addition, that his representation would square with the policy of\nthe statute because Guam and the MSC have no adverse interests in the FMC\nproceedings, and he urges the relevance of the principle that criminal statutes must\nbe strictly construed. Id. at 4-5. These arguments are unpersuasive. First, although Guam is not a \u201c person\u201d under some other statutes, see, e.g.,\nNgiraingas v. Sanchez, 495 U.S. 182 (1990) (Guam not a \u201c person\u201d under 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983), it is a \u201c person\u201d under \u00a7207. That provision treats even the United\nStates and the District of Columbia as persons; it applies to representation of \u201c any\nother person (except the United States or the District of Columbia).\u201d It also treats\nstate and local governments as \u201c persons\u201d : a one-year \u201c cooling o f f \u2019 period for\nrepresentation by former high-level officials of \u201c persons other than the United\nStates,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(c), (d) & (e), is expressly made inapplicable to represen\u00ad\ntation undertaken by employees of state and local governments, on behalf of those\ngovernments. See id. \u00a7207(j)(2)(A). Representation of state or local governments\nby former federal employees, therefore, could violate \u00a7 207(a)(1), the provision\nat issue here. By providing exemptions for work on behalf of the United States,\nthe District of Columbia, and (in some circumstances) state and local governments,\nand by restricting certain other work on behalf of state and local governments,\nthe statute bespeaks an intent to cover units of government as \u201c persons.\u201d Cf.\nUnited States v. Smith, 499 U.S. 160, 167 (1991) (quoting Andrus v. G lover\nConstr. Co., 446 U.S. 608, 616-17 (1980)) (\u201c \u2018Where Congress explicitly enumer\u00ad\nates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to\nbe implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d ). Guam\nis therefore a \u201c person\u201d under \u00a7207. 327 Opinions o f the Office o f Legal Counsel in Volume 20",

Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd., 764 F.2d 1285, 1286,\n1289 (9th Cir. 1985), cert, denied, 475 U.S. 1081 (1986) (Commerce Clause and\nantitrust laws), it is not the \u201c United States\u201d for purposes of \u00a7207. It would be\nanomalous for Guam to be an instrumentality of the United States under a statute\nthat even treats the United States and the District of Columbia as separate entities. Section 207(a)(1) applies to \u201c any communication to or appearance before any\nofficer or employee . . . of the United States or the District of Columbia, on\nbehalf of any other person (except the United States or the District of Columbia),\u201d\nand clarifies that former officials of the United States may communicate to or\nappear before officers and employees of the District of Columbia, and vice versa. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(3). Thus, the District of Columbia is not covered by the term\n\u201c the United States\u201d in \u00a7207, and there is no apparent reason why an unincor\u00ad\nporated territory with its own government, see, e.g., 48 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71421-1423,\nshould receive different treatment. Furthermore, \u00a7 207 is aimed, among other things, at preventing former employ\u00ad\nees of the United States from \u201c switching sides\u201d in particular matters involving\nspecific parties, such as litigation. See, e.g., 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2637.101(c)(1) (1996). 2\nGuam and the United States may now appear separately in litigation and take\nopposite sides. As Judge (now Justice) Kennedy explained, \u201c the executive branch\nof the Government of Guam [before 1971] might have been deemed under the\ncontrol of the United States\u201d as to litigation, because the Governor was appointed\nby the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, but\n[o]nce the Governorship of Guam was made an elected office, the\nUnited States relinquished its control over the executive of the Gov\u00ad\nernment of Guam. The executive branch is responsible now to the\npeople of Guam. That the Government of Guam is now capable\nof acting independently of the United States in deciding whether\nto sue the United States is evidenced by the institution of the\npresent action. G overnm ent o f Guam v. United States, 744 F.2d 699, 701 (9th Cir. 1984). Given this possibility of conflict between the United States and Guam and given the\nstatutory structure, we believe that Guam does not fall within the term \u201c the United\nStates\u201d as used in \u00a7207. To be sure, there may be some instances where, even within the executive\nbranch of the federal government, an employee who leaves one agency and joins\n2 H ie statute is also designed to restrict trading on past friendships and associations and prevent the unfair use\no f inside information. 5 C.F.R. \u00a72637.101(c)(2), Roswell B.

(The regulation cited, 5 C.F.R. \u00a72637.I01(c), applies only to persons who\nleft the governm ent before statutory amendments became effective on January 1, 1991, but the earlier regulations\n\u201c remain []persuasive\u201d to the extent the statute has not changed.

It is basically an intra-govemmental regulatory body whose employees some\u00ad\ntimes come from other agencies having worked on pending matters before the\nFLRA or who may wish to leave [the] FLRA for an agency which has a matter\npending at the FLRA in which they are officially involved.\u201d OGE Informal Opin\u00ad\nion 86x1 (1986). We do not believe, however, that these instances are analogous\nto the present case. The employee who transfers from one executive agency to\nanother remains under the control of the executive branch and subject to its ethics\nregulations. As the Office of Government Ethics has noted, \u201c [t]he FLRA . . .\nhas been very sensitive to these situations and has used its standards of conduct\nto provide guidance for its employees.\u201d Id. Congress has left these conflicts to\nbe policed by regulations issued by agencies plainly within the United States gov\u00ad\nernment; it hardly follows that \u00a7207 should be construed as inapplicable to an\nentity \u201c capable of acting independently of the United States.\u201d Government o f\nGuam, 744 F.2d at 701. We may assume, as the former employee argues, that the United States and\nGuam do not have adverse interests in the action before the FMC and that there\nis no \u201c reasonably probable scenario\u201d for future adversity. See Memorandum from\nMSC Designated Agency Ethics Official, Re: Government o f the Territory o f\nGuam et al. v. Sea-Land and APL, FMC D ocket No. 8 9 -2 6 (Feb. 23, 1996). But\n\u00a7207 is a prophylactic statute that is \u201c intended to prevent even the appearance\nof wrongdoing and that may apply to conduct that has caused no actual injury\nto the United States.\u201d Crandon v. United States, 494 U.S. 152, 164 (1990) (de\u00ad\nscribing another conflict of interest law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7209). It creates a prohibition\napplicable to specified types of circumstances, as listed in the statute, where con\u00ad\nflicts may arise. On its face, the language of \u00a7 207 draws no distinction between\nmatters in which the interests of the person represented by the former employee\ncoincide with the interests of the United States and those in which the interests\ndiverge or are adverse. The statute reaches \u2018\u2018any investigation, application, request\nfor a ruling or determination, rulemaking, contract, controversy, claim, charge,\naccusation, arrest, or judicial or other proceeding.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7207(i)(3) (empha\u00ad\nsis added).",

See a lso OGE Informal Opinion 80x4 (1980); 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a72637.201 (b)(5) (1996).
