      "content": "(Slip Opinion) Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment\nCongress has constitutional authority to impose a deadline for ratifying a proposed\nconstitutional amendment. It exercised this authority when proposing the Equal Rights\nAmendment and, because three-fourths of the state legislatures did not ratify before\nthe deadline that Congress imposed, the Equal Rights Amendment has failed of adoption and is no longer pending before the States. Accordingly, even if one or more state\nlegislatures were to ratify the proposed amendment, it would not become part of the\nConstitution, and the Archivist could not certify its adoption under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 106b. Congress may not revive a proposed amendment after a deadline for its ratification has\nexpired. Should Congress wish to propose the amendment anew, it may do so through\nthe same procedures required to propose an amendment in the first instance, consistent\nwith Article V of the Constitution. January 6, 2020 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE GENERAL COUNSEL\nNATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION You have asked for our views concerning the legal status of the Equal\nRights Amendment (\u201cERA\u201d). Consistent with Article V of the Constitution, two-thirds of both Houses passed a joint resolution proposing the\nERA, which would become part of the Constitution when ratified by\nthree-fourths of the States. See 86 Stat. 1523 (1972) (\u201cERA Resolution\u201d). Consistent with the last seven amendments adopted before 1972, Congress conditioned ratification on a deadline, requiring that the necessary\nnumber of States (thirty-eight) approve the amendment within seven\nyears. See id. As that deadline approached, only thirty-five States had\nratified the ERA, and several had sought to rescind their initial approvals. Congress took the unprecedented step of voting, with a simple majority in\neach House, to extend the deadline by three years, until June 30, 1982. See 92 Stat. 3799 (1978). That new deadline came and went, however,\nwithout additional ratifications. The ERA thus failed to secure the necessary ratifications within either of Congress\u2019s deadlines. Nearly four decades later, ERA supporters have renewed their push to\nratify the amendment. Some have urged Congress to restart the ratification process by proposing it anew. See, e.g., Remarks of Justice Ruth\nBader Ginsburg, Georgetown University Law Center (Sept. 12, 2019)\n(\u201c[T]he ERA fell three States short of ratification. I hope someday it will\nbe put back in the political hopper, starting over again, collecting the\n1 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 44 necessary number of States to ratify it.\u201d). 1 Others, however, have urged\nthe outstanding States to ratify the long-expired ERA Resolution, arguing\nthat the congressional deadline was invalid or could be retroactively\nnullified by Congress. In 2017, Nevada voted to ratify the ERA, see S.J.\nRes. 2, 79th Leg. (Nev. 2017), and in 2018, Illinois did the same, see S.J.\nRes. Const. Amend. 0004, 100th Gen. Assemb. (Ill. 2018). If the ratification period remains open, and if the efforts by five States to rescind their\nearlier ratifications are disregarded, then thirty-seven States could be\ncredited with having voted to ratify the ERA. After falling just short of\nratifying the ERA during its 2019 session, the Virginia legislature is\nexpected to vote again early this year.",

      "content": "After falling just short of\nratifying the ERA during its 2019 session, the Virginia legislature is\nexpected to vote again early this year. Congress has charged the Archivist of the United States with the\nresponsibility to publish a new constitutional amendment upon receiving\nthe formal instruments of ratification from the necessary number of\nStates. Whenever the National Archives and Records Administration\n(\u201cNARA\u201d) receives \u201cofficial notice\u201d that an amendment to the Constitution \u201chas been adopted,\u201d the Archivist \u201cshall forthwith cause the amendment to be published\u201d along with a certificate identifying the States that\nratified the amendment and declaring \u201cthat the [amendment] has become\nvalid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the Constitution of the\nUnited States.\u201d 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 106b. In view of this responsibility, NARA has\nreceived inquiries from Members of Congress and from several States\nasking about the status of the ERA. Accordingly, you have asked for our\nviews on the legal status of the proposed amendment. 2 We conclude that Congress had the constitutional authority to impose\na deadline on the ratification of the ERA and, because that deadline has\nexpired, the ERA Resolution is no longer pending before the States. The\nSupreme Court has upheld Congress\u2019s authority to impose a deadline for\nratifying a proposed constitutional amendment. See Dillon v. Gloss, 256\nU.S. 368, 375\u201376 (1921) (\u201cOf the power of Congress, keeping within\n1 https://www.facebook.com/georgetownlaw/videos/justice-ginsburg-to-address-newgeorgetown-law-students/2325195750861807 (remarks starting at 1:03:35); see also\nMarcia Coyle, Partisan Divisions Are \u2018Not Serving Our Country Well,\u2019 Justice Ginsburg\nSays, Nat\u2019l L.J., Sept. 12, 2019 (quoting Justice Ginsburg\u2019s remarks on the ERA), https://\nwww.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/09/12/partisan-divisions-are-not-serving-ourcountry-well-justice-ginsburg-says/. 2 See Letter for Steven A. Engel, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel,\nfrom Gary M. Stern, General Counsel, National Archives and Records Administration\n(Dec. 12, 2018). 2 Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment reasonable limits, to fix a definite period for the ratification we entertain\nno doubt.\u201d). Although Congress fixed the ratification deadline in the\nproposing clause of the ERA Resolution, rather than in the proposed\namendment\u2019s text, that choice followed established practice. After incorporating ratification deadlines in the text of four amendments, see U.S.\nConst. amends. XVIII, XX\u2013XXII, Congress placed deadlines in the resolutions proposing each of the next four amendments. Both Houses of\nCongress, by the requisite two-thirds majorities, adopted the terms of the\nERA Resolution, including the ratification deadline, and the state legislatures were well aware of that deadline when they considered the resolution. We therefore do not believe that the location of the deadline alters its\neffectiveness. The more difficult question concerns whether Congress, having initially\nspecified that state legislatures must ratify the proposed amendment\nwithin seven years, may modify that deadline. In 1977, this Office advised\nthat Congress could extend the ERA\u2019s deadline before it had expired. See\nMemorandum for Robert J. Lipshutz, Counsel to the President, from John\nM. Harmon, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re:\nConstitutionality of Extending the Time Period for Ratification of the\nProposed Equal Rights Amendment (Oct. 31, 1977) (\u201cConstitutionality of\nERA Extension\u201d). 3",

Although we disagree with the 1977 opinion\u2019s conclusion that Congress may extend a ratification deadline on an amendment pending before\nthe States, we agree in any event that Congress may not revive a proposed\namendment after the deadline has expired. The Constitution authorizes\nCongress to propose amendments for ratification, but it does not contemThe 1977 opinion is not published in the Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel, but\nit was reprinted in connection with Assistant Attorney General Harmon\u2019s November 1,\n1977 congressional testimony. See Equal Rights Amendment Extension: Hearings on H.J.\nRes. 638 Before the Subcomm. on Civil & Constitutional Rights of the H. Comm. on the\nJudiciary, 95th Cong. 7\u201327 (1978). 3 3 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 44 plate any continuing role for Congress during the ratification period. See\nU.S. Const. art. V. Even if Congress could validly extend the ERA\u2019s\nratification deadline before its expiration, that deadline expired decades\nago. Should the people of the United States wish to adopt the ERA as part\nof the Constitution, then the appropriate path is for Congress (or a convention sought by the state legislatures) to propose that amendment once\nmore, in a manner consistent with Article V of the Constitution. I.\nCongress proposed the ERA to the States after five decades of deliberation over whether such an amendment was necessary to secure equal\nrights for women or might instead cut back on existing protections. The\nfirst ERA proposal was introduced in 1923. It would have provided that\n\u201c[m]en and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States\nand every place subject to its jurisdiction\u201d and that Congress could \u201cenforce this article by appropriate legislation.\u201d S.J. Res. 21, 68th Cong.\n(1923); see also H.R.J. Res. 75, 68th Cong. (1923). The measure faced\nopposition from traditionalists and some leaders of the women\u2019s movement, including many who feared that the amendment would invalidate\nlabor laws that protected women. See Mary Frances Berry, Why ERA\nFailed: Politics, Women\u2019s Rights, and the Amending Process of the Constitution 56\u201360 (1986). The proposal did not advance in 1923, but it was\nre-introduced repeatedly over the next fifty years, and it was the subject\nof multiple committee hearings. 4 The amendment appears to have first\nreached the Senate floor in July 1946, where it fell short of the required\ntwo-thirds majority by a vote of 38 to 35. See 92 Cong. Rec. 9404\u201305\n(1946).",

Rec. 872\u201373 (1950). On both occasions, however,\nthe House did not act on the measure. 4 See, e.g., H.R.J. Res. 42, 79th Cong. (1945); S.J. Res. 8, 77th Cong. (1941); S.J. Res.\n65, 75th Cong.

In 1970, Representative Martha Griffiths obtained the necessary signatures for a discharge petition to move the resolution out of the House Judiciary Committee, and the House approved the resolution by an overwhelming\nmargin. See 116 Cong. Rec. 28004, 28036\u201337 (1970). The Senate, however, did not take a final vote on the resolution. See S. Rep. No. 92-689, at\n4\u20135 (1972). Notably, in the debates over the ERA, opponents had seized\non the absence of a ratification deadline. See, e.g., 116 Cong. Rec. 28012\n(1970) (remarks of Rep. Celler); see also 116 Cong. Rec. 36302 (1970)\n(remarks of Sen. Ervin) (proposing to amend the earlier resolution to\ninclude a seven-year deadline for ratification). In the 92nd Congress, the resolution finally met with bicameral success. The House adopted the ERA Resolution by the requisite two-thirds\nmajority on October 12, 1971. 117 Cong. Rec. 35815 (1971). The Senate\ndid the same on March 22, 1972. 118 Cong. Rec. 9598 (1972). The ERA Resolution reads in its entirety:\nJOINT RESOLUTION\nProposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States\nrelative to equal rights for men and women. Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each\nHouse concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as\nan amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall\nbe valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when\nratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress:\n\u201cARTICLE \u2014\n\u201cSECTION 1.

The seven year time limitation\nassures that ratification reflects the contemporaneous views of the people.\u201d S. Rep. No. 92-689, at 20; see also Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment: A Question of Time, 57 Tex. L. Rev.\n919, 921 (1979) (stating that ERA supporters \u201cthought the stipulation\ninnocuous, a \u2018customary\u2019 statute of limitations, not a matter of substance\nworth opposing\u201d (footnote omitted)). Congress therefore made the deliberate choice to subject the proposed amendment to a seven-year ratification deadline. After Congress adopted the ERA Resolution, the Acting Administrator\nof the General Services Administration transmitted certified copies of the\nfull text of the resolution to the States with a request that each governor\nsubmit the proposed amendment \u201cto the legislature of your state for such\naction as it may take.\u201d Constitutionality of ERA Extension at 3; see, e.g.,\nLetter for George C. Wallace, Governor, State of Alabama, from Rod\nKreger, Acting Administrator, General Services Administration (Mar. 24,\n1972). 5 Twenty-two States ratified the ERA by the end of 1972. 6 The\nAs we have previously recognized, \u201cSection 106b and its antecedents have long been\nunderstood as imposing a ministerial, \u2018record-keeping\u2019 duty upon the executive branch.\u201d Congressional Pay Amendment, 16 Op. O.L.C. 85, 98 (1992). From 1791 to 1951, the\nSecretary of State reported on the ratification of new amendments, a practice that Congress formally endorsed in 1818. See Act of Apr. 20, 1818, ch. 80, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 439. The\nAdministrator of General Services held the duty from 1951 to 1984. See Pub. L. No. 82248, ch. 655, sec. 2(b), \u00a7 106b, 65 Stat. 710, 710 (1951). In 1984, the role was transferred\nto the Archivist. See Pub. L. No. 98-497, \u00a7 107(d), 98 Stat. 2280, 2291 (1984). 6 The States were Hawaii, New Hampshire, Delaware, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska,\nTexas, Tennessee, Alaska, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Colorado, West Virginia, Wisconsin, New York, Michigan, Maryland, Massachusetts, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and\n5 6 Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment political winds shifted, however, and only thirteen more States ratified\nwithin the next five years. 7",

In connection with these hearings, Assistant Attorney General Harmon\nreleased an opinion, which he had provided to the Counsel to the President, concluding that the proposed extension of the ERA would likely be\nconstitutional. See Constitutionality of ERA Extension at 1. The opinion\nadvised that \u201crespectable arguments can be made on both sides of this\nquestion,\u201d since Article V \u201ccan be viewed as envisioning a process\nwhereby Congress proposes an amendment and is divested of any power\nonce the amendment is submitted to the States for ratification.\u201d Id. at 7. Nevertheless, the opinion ultimately concluded that Congress\u2019s authority\nto \u201cestablish a \u2018reasonable\u2019 time in which ratification may occur,\u201d id.,\nmay be subject to modification by a later Congress at least where the\ndeadline has not yet expired, see id. at 5\u20138, 16\u201317. The opinion reasoned\nthat the ERA\u2019s deadline was not in the proposed amendment\u2019s actual text\nand therefore concerned only a \u201c\u2018subsidiary matter[] of detail\u2019\u201d that\nCongress could revise by a simple majority vote of both Houses.

Several States and state legislators challenged the validity of the resolution extending the ratification deadline, and a federal district court held\nthat Congress had exceeded its authority in passing the extension resolution. See Idaho v. Freeman, 529 F. Supp. 1107, 1150\u201354 (D. Idaho 1981),\nvacated as moot, 459 U.S. 809 (1982).

The Supreme Court allowed briefing on appeals from\nthe district court, granted certiorari before judgment in the court of appeals, and stayed the district court\u2019s judgment. See Nat\u2019l Org. for Women,\nInc. v. Idaho, 455 U.S. 918 (1982). But before the Court was able to\naddress the validity of Congress\u2019s deadline extension on the merits, the\nextended deadline expired without ratifications by any additional States. The Court then vacated the district court\u2019s judgment and remanded the\ncases with instructions to dismiss the complaints as moot. See Nat\u2019l Org.\nfor Women, Inc. v. Idaho, 459 U.S. 809 (1982). After the expiration of the 1982 deadline, many of the ERA\u2019s supporters acknowledged that the ratification effort had failed and would have to\nbegin anew. See Berry, Why ERA Failed at 81 (\u201cIn the aftermath of\nERA\u2019s defeat, proponents began to assess the reasons for failure.\u201d); see\nalso Adam Clymer, Time Runs Out for Proposed Rights Amendment, N.Y.\nTimes, July 1, 1982, at A12 (\u201cThe drive to ratify the proposed Federal\nequal rights amendment . . . failed tonight in the states, still three legislatures short of the 38 that would have made it the 27th Amendment to the\nConstitution.\u201d); Marjorie Hunter, Leaders Concede Loss on Equal Rights,\nN.Y.

The ERA\u2019s supporters in Congress offered new resolutions to reintroduce the ERA,\nwhich, if approved by two-thirds majorities, would have restarted the\nratification process. See 128 Cong.

In January 1983, Joint Resolution 1 was introduced in the House, proposing the ERA for ratification by state legislatures with a new seven-year\ndeadline. See H.R.J. Res. 1, 98th Cong. (1983). The House voted on the\nresolution, but it fell short of the necessary two-thirds majority. See 129\nCong. Rec. 32668, 32684\u201385 (1983).

(Ill. 2018). The Virginia legislature\nnarrowly failed to approve the amendment in 2019, but ERA supporters\nwill try again this year. 12 If the ratification votes from 1972 to 1977\nremain valid, and the five rescissions of those ratifications are disregarded, then thirty-seven of the States may be viewed as having approved the\nERA Resolution. In that case, the approval by Virginia, or by another\nstate legislature, would require a determination as to whether the ERA\nResolution remains pending, notwithstanding the congressional deadline. The passage of House Joint Resolution 79, or a similar resolution, would\nlikewise require a determination as to whether Congress may revive the\nERA Resolution by retroactively removing the earlier deadline. Accordingly, you have requested our opinion on these matters. 11 See also Press Release, H.

Congress required that the ERA Resolution be ratified within a fixed\nperiod, and whether the effective deadline was in 1979 or 1982, that time\nhas come and gone. The ERA Resolution thus has expired unless the\ndeadline was somehow invalid in the first place. Yet in Dillon, the Supreme Court squarely upheld Congress\u2019s authority to set a ratification\ndeadline, 256 U.S. at 374\u201376, and that conclusion is consistent not only\nwith Article V of the Constitution, but with the history of the seven\namendments proposed and ratified since Dillon. For the last four of those\namendments, Congress placed the deadline in the proposing clause\u2014the\nclause containing the procedural rules for ratification that, like the\namendment itself, has always been adopted by two-thirds of both Houses\nof Congress.

In connection\nwith promises made during the state ratifying conventions for the original\nConstitution, the First Congress in 1789 proposed twelve amendments to\nthe States.

See\nSprague, 282 U.S. at 732 (recognizing that \u201cthe choice of mode rests\nsolely in the discretion of Congress\u201d). In making such determinations, Congress has specified the mode of ratification in the proposing clause included within every resolution proposing a constitutional amendment. For every successful amendment, both\nHouses of Congress approved the proposing clause at the same time as the\ntext of the proposed amendment, and they did so by a two-thirds vote. Congress included such a clause in the very first set of amendments\nproposed to the States, ten of which were ratified in 1791 as the Bill of\nRights (and one of which was ratified in 1992 as the Twenty-Seventh\nAmendment). The resolution recited that Congress was proposing twelve\nGeorge Tucker ed., 1803) (observing that the convention process \u201cwill probably never be\nresorted to, unless the federal government should betray symptoms of corruption,\u201d and\ndescribing the convention process as a \u201cradical and effectual remedy\u201d). As a historical\nmatter, the state legislatures have never successfully petitioned for such a convention, and\nevery amendment proposed to the States to date has come from Congress in the first\ninstance. 14 The Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict a civil officer in an impeachment trial, U.S. Const. art.

B.\nArticle V does not expressly address how long the States have to ratify\na proposed amendment. The \u201carticle says nothing about the time within\nwhich ratification may be had\u2014neither that it shall be unlimited nor that\nit shall be fixed by Congress.\u201d Dillon, 256 U.S. at 371. The text does\ndirect that \u201c[t]he Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall\ndeem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution[.]\u201d U.S.\nConst. art. V (emphases added). This language authorizes Congress to\npropose amendments for ratification when two-thirds majorities in each\nchamber deem it necessary, thereby implying that Congress may propose\namendments for the period that the requisite majorities deem necessary. See Dillon, 256 U.S. at 375 (\u201c[I]t is only when there is deemed to be a\nnecessity therefor that amendments are to be proposed, the reasonable\nimplication being that when proposed they are to be considered and disposed of presently.\u201d). Article V thus requires Congress to make a judgment concerning the needs of the moment and, from that, the Supreme\nCourt has inferred the power to set a deadline by which the States must\nratify, or reject, Congress\u2019s judgment. See id. at 375\u201376. The Court reached this conclusion in Dillon, which upheld Congress\u2019s\nauthority to impose a deadline for ratifying the Eighteenth Amendment,\nwhich established Prohibition.

The Court reached this conclusion in Dillon, which upheld Congress\u2019s\nauthority to impose a deadline for ratifying the Eighteenth Amendment,\nwhich established Prohibition. See U.S. Const. amend. XVIII, \u00a7\u00a7 1\u20132. In section 3 of the Amendment, Congress conditioned its effectiveness\nupon the requirement that it be ratified within seven years. See id. \u00a7 3\n(\u201cThis article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an\namendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several States, as\nprovided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the\nsubmission hereof to the States by the Congress.\u201d). The Senate had previously considered proposing ratification deadlines for the Fourteenth and\nFifteenth Amendments. See Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 3d Sess. 912\u201313,\n1309\u201314 (1869); Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. 2771 (1866). But\nthe Eighteenth Amendment was the first amendment to include one. In Dillon, a prisoner detained in violation of the National Prohibition\nAct (which was enacted pursuant to federal power authorized by the\nEighteenth Amendment) argued that the presence of the deadline invali16 Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment dated the amendment because \u201cCongress has no constitutional power to\nlimit the time of deliberation or otherwise attempt to control what the\nlegislatures of the States shall do in their deliberation.\u201d Br. for Appellant\nat 4, Dillon v. Gloss, 256 U.S. 368 (1921) (No. 251). In rejecting this\nclaim, the Court observed that \u201csome\u201d of the first seventeen amendments\nhad been ratified \u201cwithin a single year after their proposal and all within\nfour years.\u201d Dillon, 256 U.S. at 372. Four other proposed amendments,\nhowever, had failed to obtain the necessary votes from the States and\n\u201clain dormant for many years,\u201d leaving it an \u201copen question\u201d whether they\n\u201ccould be resurrected.\u201d Id. at 372\u201373. To avoid such future uncertainty,\nthe Court explained, Congress fixed a seven-year deadline for the ratification of the Prohibition amendment. Id. at 373; see also 55 Cong. Rec.\n5557 (1917) (remarks of Sen. Ashurst) (expressing support for a provision\n\u201climiting the time in the case of this amendment or any other amendment\nto 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or even 20 years, so that we will not hand down to\nposterity a conglomerate mass of amendments floating around in a cloudy,\nnebulous, hazy way\u201d). In upholding Congress\u2019s authority to impose deadlines, the Court recognized that Article V does not expressly address the timing of ratification. See Dillon, 256 U.S. at 371. It nevertheless read the text to imply a\ndegree of contemporaneity between an amendment\u2019s proposal and its\nratification, which \u201care not treated as unrelated acts but as succeeding\nsteps in a single endeavor, the natural inference being that they are not to\nbe widely separated in time.\u201d Id. at 374\u201375.

The Court\nreasoned that, \u201c[a]s a rule[,] the Constitution speaks in general terms,\nleaving Congress to deal with subsidiary matters of detail as the public\ninterests and changing conditions may require; and article V is no exception to the rule.\u201d Id. at 376 (footnote omitted).

See id. at 97, 105. Because the ERA Resolution contained a\ndeadline (which has expired), we do not need to consider in this opinion the 1992 opinion\u2019s reading of Dillon. 17 18 Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment course in the proposing clauses of the Twenty-Fourth, Twenty-Fifth, and\nTwenty-Sixth Amendments. See 76 Stat. at 1259; 79 Stat. at 1327; 85\nStat. at 825. There is no reason for deadlines declared in proposing clauses to be any less binding on the ratification process than those included in\nthe text of proposed amendments. In Dillon, the Supreme Court held that Congress\u2019s decision to fix \u201ca\ndefinite period for ratification\u201d is \u201ca matter of detail which Congress may\ndetermine as an incident of its power to designate the mode of ratification\u201d under Article V. 256 U.S. at 376. In the first resolution proposing\nconstitutional amendments, Congress identified the mode of ratification in\nthe resolution\u2019s proposing clause, separate from the text of the proposed\namendments themselves. See supra pp. 14\u201315. Congress has specified the\nmode of ratification in the proposing clause of every resolution proposing\na constitutional amendment since then. See supra note 15. Each time, twothirds of both Houses of Congress approved these measures. Insofar as\nCongress and the States have relied upon proposing clauses to specify the\nmode of ratification since 1789, we think it clear that Congress may\nexercise its integrally related authority to set a deadline in precisely the\nsame manner. Chief Justice Hughes suggested as much when he observed\nthat the Child Labor Amendment did not include a ratification deadline\n\u201ceither in the proposed amendment or in the resolution of submission.\u201d Coleman, 307 U.S. at 452. As we recognized in 1977, \u201c[t]he history of congressional use of a\nseven-year limitation demonstrates that Congress moved from inclusion\nof the limit in the text of proposed amendments to including it within the\nproposing clauses . . . without ever indicating any intent to change the\nsubstance of their actions.\u201d Constitutionality of ERA Extension at 15. After the Court\u2019s 1921 decision in Dillon confirmed the validity of the\nEighteenth Amendment\u2019s ratification deadline, Congress included a\nseven-year deadline in the Twentieth, Twenty-First, and Twenty-Second\nAmendments.

By including such a provision in the amendment itself, Congress ensured that approvals secured after the seven-year\ndeadline would be ineffective.

V\u2014the amendment, by its\nown terms, would be legally inert. Members of Congress recognized, however, that these textual deadlines\ncame at a cost. With each amendment, the Nation\u2019s highest law became\nincreasingly cluttered with extraneous sections imposing conditions on\nratification that had no prospective effect. Once three-fourths of the States\nratified amendments within the prescribed deadlines, the deadlines, having already fulfilled their purpose, were nonetheless added to the constitutional text. To avoid exacerbating that problem, Congress adopted an\nalternative way of setting a ratification deadline when it proposed the\nTwenty-Third Amendment. Rather than including the deadline in the\namendment\u2019s text, Congress put it in the proposing clause specifying the\nmode of ratification. See 74 Stat. at 1057. As Senator Kefauver had explained: The general idea was that it was better not to make the 7-year provision a part of the proposed constitutional amendment itself. It was\nfelt that that would clutter up the Constitution. . . . We wanted to put\nthe 7-year limitation in the preamble. So the intention of the preamble is that it must be ratified within 7 years in order to be effective. 101 Cong. Rec. 6628 (1955); see also Appointment of Representatives:\nHearing on S.J.

There is no doubt about the power of Congress to put it there; and it will\nbe equally effective.

See Certification of\nAmendment to Constitution of the United States Granting Representation\nin the Electoral College to the District of Columbia, 26 Fed. Reg. 2808\n(Apr. 3, 1961). And Congress repeated the very same course by including\ndeadlines in the proposing clauses for the Twenty-Fourth, Twenty-Fifth,\nand Twenty-Sixth Amendments. See 76 Stat. at 1259; 79 Stat. at 1327;\n85 Stat. at 825. 19 In 1977, we observed that Congress appears to have\nadopted this approach without any discussion about potentially placing\nthe deadlines elsewhere. See Constitutionality of ERA Extension at 14\u201315. And we have found no indication that Members of Congress (or any\ncourt) seriously questioned the binding nature of a deadline stated in a\nresolution\u2019s proposing clause rather than the text of its proposed amendment. In the case of the ERA Resolution, Congress again included a ratification deadline in the proposing clause. Members suggested that, by this\ntime, it had become the customary way of setting a deadline. See, e.g.,\nS. Rep. No. 92-689, at 20 (1972) (describing the deadline as part of the\n\u201ctraditional form of a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment for ratification by the States\u201d and stating that it \u201chas been included\nin every amendment added to the Constitution in the last 50 years\u201d).

We have not identified the expression of any similar concern\nwith respect to the Twenty-Third or any subsequent Amendment, and, as discussed below,\nwe believe this concern is misplaced. 19 In proposing the Twenty-Third and Twenty-Fourth Amendments, Congress provided\nthat the amendment would be valid \u201conly if ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of\nthe several States within seven years from the date of its submission\u201d (emphasis added).

See Constitutionality of ERA Extension at 15. 21 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 44 opponents had faulted an earlier version of the resolution for the absence\nof a deadline. See, e.g., 116 Cong. Rec. at 28012 (remarks of Rep. Celler,\nChairman of the House Judiciary Committee) (decrying the fact that,\nwithout a deadline, \u201c[t]his amendment could roam around State legislatures for 50 years\u201d and arguing that the \u201ccustomar[y]\u201d seven-year deadline\nshould be added); id. at 36302 (remarks of Sen. Ervin) (proposing a\nseven-year deadline and noting that \u201cwe still have floating around some\nunratified amendments that were submitted at the time of the original\nsubmission of the Bill of Rights\u201d). And ERA supporters confirmed that,\nwhile they expected prompt ratification, the seven-year deadline would\nimpose a binding time limit. See 117 Cong. Rec. at 35814\u201315 (remarks of\nRep. Griffiths) (recognizing that the deadline will ensure that the resolution \u201cshould not be hanging over our head forever\u201d); 118 Cong. Rec. at\n9552 (remarks of Sen. Hartke) (recognizing that if the ERA is not \u201cratified within 7 years,\u201d then \u201cwe must begin the entire process once again\u201d). In proposing the ERA to the States with a deadline, Members of Congress\nthus recognized that the deadline was a binding condition upon its ratification. Apart from the seven-year deadline in the proposing clause, the ERA\nResolution included a separate timing requirement\u2014a delay on effectiveness for two years after ratification\u2014in section 3 of the text of the proposed amendment. But this distinction did not make the seven-year deadline any less mandatory than the two-year delay. Unlike with ratification\ndeadlines, Congress has never placed an amendment\u2019s delayed effective\ndate in a proposing clause. Nor is it clear that it could effectively do so,\nbecause Article V declares that a proposed amendment \u201cshall be valid to\nall Intents and Purposes, as Part of [the] Constitution, when ratified.\u201d\nU.S. Const. art. V (emphasis added). Including the two-year delay in the\namendment itself could be necessary to amend the effect that Article V\nwould otherwise have on the amendment\u2019s effective date. After Congress proposed the ERA Resolution, state legislatures considered whether to ratify it subject to all of the conditions imposed by Congress, including the seven-year deadline. Of the thirty-five state legislatures that ratified between 1972 and 1977, twenty-five expressly voted\nupon a state measure that included the text of the ERA Resolution in\nits entirety (and hence the deadline). See Senate Extension Hearings at\n739\u201354, 756\u201361. Five others did not expressly vote on the entire text of\nthe ERA Resolution, but the seven-year deadline was otherwise repeated\nin the measures that they approved. See id. at 739\u201340, 742\u201343, 746\u201347,\n22 Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment 752\u201354, 758. And South Dakota\u2019s legislature expressly provided that its\nratification would be formally withdrawn if the ERA were not adopted\nwithin the seven-year deadline. S.J. Res. 2, 54th Leg.

Accordingly, the States that ratified the ERA Resolution plainly did so with\nthe knowledge of the timing condition and with the understanding that the\nseven-year deadline was part and parcel of the amendment proposal. Although some ERA supporters have recently questioned the enforceability of the deadline, no one involved with the ERA around the time of\nits proposal seems to have done so. As the original ratification period\nneared its end, Congress weighed extending the deadline precisely to\navoid the failure of the amendment. For instance, Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, the primary sponsor of the extension resolution, testified\nthat \u201c[t]he cosponsors of [the] resolution have every hope that the equal\nrights amendment will be ratified before March 22, 1979, but do believe\nthere might be need for an insurance policy to assure that the deadline\nwill not arbitrarily end all debate on the ERA.\u201d House Extension Hearings at 4 (emphasis added). And while this Office advised that Congress\ncould extend the deadline, we nonetheless recognized that the proposed\namendment would otherwise expire. See Constitutionality of ERA Extension at 15. Even more telling, the Supreme Court necessarily recognized the enforceability of the deadline by finding that the legal controversy over the\nERA extension became moot when the extended deadline lapsed. After\nthe district court in Idaho v. Freeman held that Congress could not extend\nthe deadline, the federal government and others sought review in the\nSupreme Court. See, e.g., Pet. of Adm\u2019r of Gen. Servs. for Writ of Cert.\nBefore J., Carmen v. Idaho, No. 81-1313 (U.S. Jan. 22, 1982); Pet. for\nWrit of Cert. Before J., Nat\u2019l Org. for Women, Inc. v.

All of this history confirms that the deadline in the proposing clause of\nthe ERA Resolution was a valid and binding exercise of Congress\u2019s\nauthority to set a deadline on ratification. Congress in 1972 required the\nERA to be ratified by a certain date as an incident to its authority to set\nthe mode of ratification. See Dillon, 256 U.S. at 376. Two-thirds of both\nHouses of Congress approved the amendment with that accompanying\ncondition, and the state legislatures that ratified did so as well. Under the\ntext and structure of Article V, and consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion in\nDillon, that condition was legally effective. Because the deadline lapsed\nwithout ratifications from the requisite thirty-eight States, the ERA Resolution is no longer pending before the States, and ratification by additional\nstate legislatures would not result in the ERA\u2019s adoption. III. Although the ERA Resolution expired decades ago, there remains the\nquestion whether Congress may revive the ERA ratification process. As\nnoted above, the House Judiciary Committee has favorably reported a\njoint resolution \u201c[r]emoving the deadline for the ratification of the equal\nrights amendment,\u201d which would purport to make the ERA \u201cvalid to all\nintents and purposes as part of the United States Constitution whenever\nratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States.\u201d H.R.J.\net al.

However, it also seemed ludicrous prior to\n1978 to suggest an extension of time for the ratification of a constitutional amendment by\na simple majority vote.\u201d). 24 Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment Res. 79, 116th Cong. (as ordered to be reported by H. Comm. on the\nJudiciary, Nov. 13, 2019); see also supra note 11 and accompanying text. We therefore must consider whether this pending resolution, if adopted by\nboth Houses of Congress, would reopen the ratification of the ERA Resolution. Congress, of course, could restart the amendment process by reproposing the ERA to the States. We do not believe, however, that Congress in 2020 may change the terms upon which the 1972 Congress proposed the ERA for the States\u2019 consideration.",

We do not believe, however, that Congress in 2020 may change the terms upon which the 1972 Congress proposed the ERA for the States\u2019 consideration. Article V does not expressly\nor implicitly grant Congress such authority. To the contrary, the text\ncontemplates no role for Congress in the ratification process after it proposes an amendment. Moreover, such a congressional power finds no\nsupport in Supreme Court precedent. While the controlling opinion in\nColeman suggested that Congress\u2014and not the Court\u2014may judge what\nconstitutes \u201ca reasonable limit of time for ratification,\u201d the opinion concerned only those instances \u201cwhen the limit has not been fixed in advance.\u201d 307 U.S. at 454 (opinion of Hughes, C.J.). By its own terms, that\nopinion does not extend to the circumstances of the ERA, where Congress\nfixed a deadline before the proposal went to the States and that period has\nnow expired. A.\nThose who believe that the ERA Resolution may be revived argue that\nCongress\u2019s authority under Article V would allow simple majorities\nin each House to eliminate the earlier ratification deadline and thereby\nextend the ratification process. See 165 Cong. Rec. H8741 (daily ed.\nNov. 8, 2019) (statement of Rep. Speier) (identifying Article V as the\nconstitutional authority for House Joint Resolution 79). Relying upon\nCongress\u2019s prior action to extend the ERA deadline, they argue that, since\nthe deadline rests in the proposing clause rather than the amendment\u2019s\ntext, it is open to congressional revision at any time, including decades\nafter its expiration. See, e.g., Held, 3 Wm & M. J. Women & L. at 128\u2013\n29; Astor, supra note 10 (\u201c\u2018It\u2019s been extended by Congress, so if you can\nextend it, you can certainly strike it,\u2019 said Representative Jackie Speier of\nCalifornia, the lead sponsor of a bipartisan House resolution to repeal the\ndeadline.\u201d). They contend not only that this approach would permit the\nStates to ratify the ERA Resolution long after the deadline, but that the\nthirty-five ratifications from the 1970s, as well as the two from the 2010s,\n25 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 44 would count towards the thirty-eight necessary to complete ratification. 21\nDespite Congress\u2019s having proposed the ERA Resolution to the States\nwith an express deadline, and the state legislatures\u2019 having voted upon it\nwith that understanding, this contingent of ERA supporters believes that a\nconcurrent resolution of Congress could void that earlier widespread\nunderstanding. We do not believe that Article V permits that approach. Congress\u2019s authority to fix a \u201cdefinite period for ratification\u201d is \u201can incident of its\npower to designate the mode of ratification.\u201d Dillon, 256 U.S. at 376. Congress may fix such a deadline for a proposed amendment \u201cso that all\nmay know what it is and speculation on what is a reasonable time may be\navoided.\u201d Id. Congress would hardly be setting a \u201cdefinite period for\nratification\u201d if a later Congress could simply revise that judgment, either\nby reducing, extending, or eliminating the deadline that had been part of\nthe proposal transmitted to the States.",

As we recognized in our\nNotably, these proponents further argue that States may not rescind their earlier ratifications, which means that a resolution would amend the terms of the proposal upon\nwhich the state legislatures voted between 1972 and 1977 and purportedly lock them into\ntheir earlier votes upon different terms, without any input from, or opportunity for reconsideration by, those legislatures.

See Federalist No.\n85, at 593 (Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cBy the fifth article of the plan the congress will be\nobliged, \u2018on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the states . . . to call a\nconvention for proposing amendments.\u2019\u201d). 27 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 44 is self-executing.

V.\nIn other words, the amendment becomes immediately effective, and\nArticle V contemplates no additional role for Congress in modifying the\nproposal or in accepting or approving ratifications by the States. For these reasons, constitutional commentators have long recognized\nthat \u201cCongress may not withdraw an amendment once it has been proposed.\u201d Constitutionality of ERA Extension at 18 n.22; see also Lester\nBernhardt Orfield, The Amending of the Federal Constitution 51\u201352\n(1942) (\u201cThe practice has been to regard such a withdrawal as ineffectual.

It therefore cannot\nexist.\u201d). Similarly, we believe that Article V does not authorize Congress\nto adjust the terms of an amendment previously proposed to the States,\nwhether it seeks to alter the mode of ratification or the deadline for ratification. Recognizing congressional authority to modify the terms of a proposed\nconstitutional amendment would present numerous questions that lack\nanswers in the text of the Constitution or the history of past amendments. Could Congress modify a substantive provision within a pending amendment, or is its modification power limited to procedural terms? Could a\nlater Congress hostile to a pending amendment shorten the deadline or\ndeclare it expired (and if so, how would such a power differ from a power\nto withdraw the pending amendment)? Must Congress adopt such changes\nby the same two-thirds vote of both Houses by which an amendment is\nproposed, or would a simple majority vote of each House suffice? And\nmust the President sign the joint resolution modifying a proposal, or\nwould the modification become immediately effective without presentment? Compare U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7, cls. 2\u20133, with Hollingsworth v.\nVirginia, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 378, 381 n.*, 382 (1798). In concluding that\n28 Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment Congress could extend the ERA\u2019s deadline, our 1977 opinion hazarded\nanswers to all of these questions, while recognizing the absence of any\nauthoritative guidance from the Constitution, caselaw, or historical practice. See Constitutionality of ERA Extension at 16\u201326. We think that the\nbetter inference to draw from the Constitution\u2019s silence is that there is no\nmodification authority in the first place. If Congress wants to remove a\nratification deadline from a proposed amendment, then it must propose an\nentirely new constitutional amendment, giving the States a new opportunity to consider that proposal. Article V does not provide for any other\nsupervisory mechanism by which Congress can adjust those terms. B.\nAlthough the text of Article V does not contemplate any further role for\nCongress after it has proposed a constitutional amendment, the Supreme\nCourt suggested one exception in Coleman, where a majority of justices\nconcluded that, when a proposed amendment contains no deadline, then\nCongress, not the courts, should have the responsibility for deciding\nwhether the States had ratified the amendment within a reasonable time. In Coleman, members of the Kansas legislature had challenged the State\u2019s\n1937 ratification of the Child Labor Amendment based, in part, on the\nground that it was untimely because Congress had proposed the amendment in 1924.

In addressing that question, the Court\nfractured on whether Dillon\u2019s requirement that an amendment be ratified\nwithin a \u201creasonable time\u201d was a matter subject to judicial resolution. There was no majority opinion, but two separate opinions, joined by a\ntotal of seven justices, agreed that where a proposed amendment lacked\nany deadline, what constituted a \u201creasonable time\u201d for ratification was a\nnonjusticiable political question. Chief Justice Hughes\u2019s controlling opinion, which was joined by Justices Stone and Reed and styled as the \u201cOpinion of the Court,\u201d concluded\nthat the political branches, and not the Court, should decide whether an\namendment had been ratified within a \u201creasonable time.\u201d See Coleman,\n307 U.S. at 454 (opinion of Hughes, C.J.). In so ruling, he reasoned that\n\u201cthe question of a reasonable time in many cases would involve . . . an\nappraisal of a great variety of relevant conditions, political, social and\neconomic,\u201d and these conditions were \u201cappropriate for the consideration\nof the political departments of the Government.\u201d Id. at 453\u201354. The Chief\nJustice advised that Congress should address that question \u201cwhen, in the\n29 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 44 presence of certified ratifications by three-fourths of the States, the time\narrives for the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment.\u201d Id. at 454\n(emphasis added). Justice Black, joined by Justices Roberts, Frankfurter,\nand Douglas, would have gone further and treated any congressional\nproclamation that an amendment had been ratified as \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201c\u2018conclusive upon the courts.\u2019\u201d Id. at 457 (Black, J., concurring) (quoting Leser\nv. Garnett, 258 U.S. 130, 137 (1922)). 24\nNeither of these Coleman opinions identified any textual foundation for\nany power of Congress to \u201cpromulgate\u201d an amendment ratified by threefourths of the States. The dissenting justices criticized the majority opinions for addressing a point that had not been \u201craised by the parties or by\nthe United States appearing as amicus curiae.\u201d Id. at 474 (Butler, J.,\ndissenting). And Coleman\u2019s conclusion has been frequently criticized as\nlacking foundation in the text, caselaw, or historical practice of congressional amendments. See, e.g., Congressional Pay Amendment, 16 Op.\nO.L.C. at 99 (\u201c[C]ongressional promulgation is neither required by Article\nV nor consistent with constitutional practice.\u201d); Dellinger, 97 Harv.

See, e.g., National Prohibition Cases,\n253 U.S. 350 (1920) (holding that the requirements of Article V were met in connection\nwith the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment); Sprague, 282 U.S. at 716 (rejecting the\nclaim that Congress was obliged to call a convention to propose the Eighteenth Amendment); Hollingsworth, 3 U.S. at 381 n.*, 382 (stating that \u201c[t]he negative of the President\napplies only to the ordinary cases of legislation,\u201d and thus holding that the Eleventh\nAmendment had been \u201cconstitutionally adopted\u201d). As then\u2013Circuit Judge John Paul\nStevens recognized, \u201csince a majority of the [Coleman] Court refused to accept [Justice\nBlack\u2019s] position in that case, and since the Court has on several occasions decided\nquestions arising under article V, even in the face of \u2018political question\u2019 contentions, that\nargument is not one which a District Court is free to accept.\u201d Dyer v. Blair, 390 F. Supp.\n1291, 1299\u20131300 & n.20 (N.D. Ill. 1975) (Stevens, J.) (footnote omitted). In contrast with\ncases involving the requirements of Article V, the Court has treated questions about\nwhether a State has ratified an amendment as nonjusticiable. See Leser, 258 U.S. at 137\n(holding a State official\u2019s \u201cduly authenticated\u201d acknowledgement of ratification to be\n\u201cconclusive upon the courts\u201d); cf. White v.

L. Rev. at 887 (\u201cColeman was a very bad decision when handed\ndown, and the Court almost certainly would decide it differently today.\u201d)\n(footnote omitted). Nothing in Article V suggests that Congress has any\nrole in promulgating an amendment after it has been ratified by the requisite number of state legislatures or conventions. To the contrary, Dillon\nheld that the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment was \u201cconsummated\u201d on the date that the thirty-sixth State had ratified it, and not thirteen\ndays later when the Acting Secretary of State had proclaimed it under the\nstatutory predecessor to 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 106b. See Dillon, 256 U.S. at 376. The\nCourt in Dillon did not suggest that there was any need for Congress to\npromulgate the amendment, and Congress did not purport to do so. Chief Justice Hughes\u2019s opinion would create a strange situation in\nwhich state legislatures voting on an amendment would not know until\nafter the fact\u2014and potentially long after the fact\u2014whether a future Congress would conclude that their ratifications had occurred within a \u201creasonable time.\u201d See Congressional Pay Amendment, 16 Op.

Coleman, 307 U.S. at\n449\u201350. There, Secretary of State George Seward had responded to irregularities in the ratifications of Ohio and New Jersey by issuing a conditional certification of the amendment \u201cif the resolutions of the legislatures\nof Ohio and New Jersey . . . are to be deemed as remaining in full force\nand effect.\u201d Proclamation No. 11, 15 Stat. 706, 707 (1868). The House\n25 In addition, the Coleman rule would suggest that Congress could block a constitutional amendment that was proposed, over Congress\u2019s objection, by a convention called\nby the States, simply by declaring that the States had not ratified it within a \u201creasonable\ntime.\u201d And because Congress\u2019s decision to block the amendment would be a political\nquestion, no court could second-guess that determination. That would vitiate the States\u2019\naffirmative power under Article V to bypass Congress. See supra notes 13 and 23. 31 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 44 and Senate responded by adopting a concurrent resolution declaring the\nFourteenth Amendment to be part of the Constitution. See Proclamation\nNo. 13, 15 Stat. 708, 709\u201310 (1868). One week later, the Secretary of\nState issued a second proclamation \u201cin execution of \u201d the States\u2019 ratifications and the concurrent resolution certifying the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 710\u201311. Based on that one episode, Chief Justice Hughes concluded that Congress could determine the timeliness of Kansas\u2019s ratification if and when\nCongress exercised its promulgation authority after three-fourths of the\nStates had submitted ratifications. But that vision of Congress\u2019s role in the\nratification process was \u201cinconsistent with both the text of Article V of\nthe Constitution and with the bulk of past practice.\u201d Congressional Pay\nAmendment, 16 Op. O.L.C. at 102. As Professor Walter Dellinger later\nobserved, \u201c[t]he action of the Reconstruction Congress with respect to the\nfourteenth amendment was literally unprecedented.\u201d Dellinger, 97 Harv.\nL. Rev. at 400. Congress had played no official role in promulgating the\nfirst thirteen amendments or any amendment since. Indeed, only two of\nthe other twenty-six amendments have been the subject of any congressional action at all, and in neither case was Congress\u2019s action deemed\nnecessary to promulgate the amendment. 26 Accordingly, the notion of a\nfreestanding authority of Congress to determine the validity of a constitutional amendment after the States have submitted their ratifications finds\nlittle support in the text of Article V, historical practice, or other Supreme\nCourt precedent. 26 The Fifteenth Amendment, like the Fourteenth, was plagued with Reconstruction\nirregularities, and the Senate initially referred to committee a joint resolution declaring\nthe Amendment to be valid and part of the Constitution, but it later passed a simple\nresolution requesting the views of the Secretary of State.",

Coleman addressed whether an amendment, which had been proposed\nthirteen years earlier, could still be ratified within a \u201creasonable time,\u201d\nand the Court held that the political branches, not the Court, must decide\nthat question. See Coleman, 307 U.S. at 454 (opinion of Hughes, C.J.). Although Chief Justice Hughes contemplated that, where an amendment\u2019s\nproposal lacked a ratification deadline, Congress could determine timeliness after the States had ratified the amendment, he did not suggest that\nCongress could nullify a deadline it had previously imposed on the States. To the contrary, the Chief Justice repeatedly emphasized that Congress\nhad not imposed any deadline on the Child Labor Amendment. His opinion stated that \u201c[n]o limitation of time for ratification is provided in the\ninstant case either in the proposed amendment or in the resolution of\nsubmission.\u201d Id. at 452 (emphasis added). The Court assumed that the\nquestion of \u201cwhat is a reasonable time\u201d may be \u201can open one when the\nlimit has not been fixed in advance\u201d by Congress. Id. at 454 (emphasis\nadded). But it concluded that, even if an amendment would lapse after\nsome period, \u201cit does not follow that, whenever Congress has not exercised that power, the Court should take upon itself the responsibility of\ndeciding what constitutes a reasonable time and determine accordingly the\nvalidity of ratifications.\u201d Id. at 452\u201353. The opinion thus repeatedly made\nclear that the Court was addressing the case where Congress did not\ninclude a deadline when proposing the amendment. Nothing in Coleman\nsupports the view that when Congress proposed an amendment and included a time limit \u201cin the resolution of submission,\u201d id. at 452, it would\nlater be free to revise that judgment.",

C.\nApart from Coleman itself, the proponents of reviving the ERA ratification process rely heavily upon Congress\u2019s 1978 decision to modify the\nERA\u2019s original deadline before it expired. The precedent of the ERA\nextension, however, is a thin reed. The action reflected something that\nCongress had never done before in our Nation\u2019s history, and the only\nfederal court to review the measure held it unconstitutional. See Idaho v.\nFreeman, 529 F. Supp. at 1153. Although this Office at the time issued an\n33 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 44 opinion recognizing Congress\u2019s authority to extend the deadline, we\nrecognized that it was \u201cdifficult to conclude with certainty that [the extension resolution] is or is not constitutional,\u201d and that \u201crespectable arguments can be made on both sides of this question.\u201d Constitutionality of\nERA Extension at 1, 7. Since then, this Office has adopted a narrower\nview of Coleman than the one reflected in our 1977 opinion, but even if\nwe adhered to all of the reasoning in the 1977 opinion, we do not believe\nthat opinion would support reviving the ERA Resolution nearly forty\nyears after the deadline expired. In Constitutionality of ERA Extension, this Office concluded that, when\nthe ratification deadline was not placed in the text of the proposed constitutional amendment, but only in the proposing clause, that condition on\nratification should be treated as equivalent to a statute subject to congressional modification. See id. 7\u20138, 15\u201316. The Office relied on Coleman\nas recognizing a congressional authority \u201cyears after an amendment has\nbeen proposed . . . to determine the reasonableness of the intervening time\nperiod\u201d and to modify a deadline placed in the proposing clause. Id. at\n7\u20138. At the same time, our opinion admitted that there was an argument\nthat \u201cArt[icle] V itself can be viewed as envisioning a process whereby\nCongress proposes an amendment and is divested of any power once the\namendment is submitted to the States for ratification,\u201d and that, \u201c[a]s\nsuggested by the language of the Coleman opinion, the question of a time\nlimit is no longer open once a time limit is imposed by the proposing\nCongress.\u201d Id. at 7. This Office later read Article V to further limit Congress\u2019s role in proposing amendments. In Congressional Pay Amendment, we rejected the\nproposition that Coleman had recognized an exclusive congressional\nauthority to determine when a constitutional amendment had been validly\nratified. See 16 Op. O.L.C. at 101\u201302. In a footnote, our 1992 opinion\nquestioned the 1977 opinion\u2019s interpretation of Coleman, although we\nsuggested that the extension of the ERA ratification deadline might be\nviewed as the \u201c\u2018reproposal\u2019 of a constitutional amendment\u201d (a purely\ncongressional action) rather than \u201cthe certification of a ratified amendment\u201d (an action in which Article V gives Congress no role). Id. at 102\nn.24. At the same time, we opined that, \u201c[t]o the extent that our earlier\nopinions suggest that Congress alone must make the determination of the\nadoption of a constitutional amendment, we reject them today.\u201d Id.",

For\nthe reasons discussed above, we also take a narrower view of Coleman\nthan the one advanced in our 1977 opinion, and we do not believe that the\n34 Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment decision supports the authority of Congress to revise a deadline included\nin an amendment previously proposed to the States. Yet even under the reasoning of Constitutionality of ERA Extension,\nthere was a distinction between congressional action to extend a pending\nratification deadline and action to revive it after the fact. That opinion\nconcluded that, under Coleman, Congress might reconsider whether a\nseven-year deadline was a \u201creasonable time\u201d for ratification, but the\nopinion simultaneously suggested that any such authority could not survive the deadline\u2019s expiration. As we observed, \u201c[c]ertainly if a time limit\nhad expired before an intervening Congress had taken action to extend\nthat limit, a strong argument could be made that the only constitutional\nmeans of reviving a proposed amendment would be to propose the\namendment anew by two-thirds vote of each House and thereby begin the\nratification process anew.\u201d Constitutionality of ERA Extension at 5\u20136. The\nActing Solicitor General effectively took the same view in Supreme Court\nlitigation about the extension of the ERA Resolution, defending the extension until the deadline expired, but then acknowledging that the effort to\nratify the ERA had come to an end. See Mem. for Adm\u2019r of Gen. Servs.\nSuggesting Mootness at 3\u20134, Nat\u2019l Org. for Women (\u201c[T]he amendment\nhas failed of adoption . . . . Even if all of the ratifications remain valid, the\nrescissions are disregarded, and Congress is conceded the power to extend\nthe ratification period as it did here, only 35 of the necessary 38 states can\nbe regarded as having ratified the Amendment.\u201d). The proponents of the 1978 ERA extension also relied upon Congress\u2019s\ngeneral authority to extend statutes of limitations. As Justice Ginsburg\nexplained in 1979, \u201c[i]n form and function, the seven-year provision is a\nstatute of limitations. Generally, statutes of limitations may be extended\nshould the legislature determine that its initial estimate was inaccurate.\u201d Ginsburg, 57 Tex. L. Rev. at 927 n.43; see also House Extension Hearings at 129 (testimony of Prof. Ruth Bader Ginsburg) (\u201cIt is the general\nrule that extensions [of ] statutes of limitation may be directed by the\nlegislature. . . . If the objective was simply to exclude [stale] claims, an\nextension of the limitation period for a reasonable time is well-accepted\nand fully comports with constitutional constraints.\u201d). 27 It is true that 27 We again note that, several months ago, Justice Ginsburg publicly stated her view\nthat the ERA \u201cfell three States short of ratification\u201d and the ratification process must\nbegin anew: \u201cI hope someday [the ERA] will be put back in the political hopper, starting 35 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 44 Congress may extend a limitations period, sometimes even after pending\nclaims have expired.",

Donaldson, 325 U.S. 304\n(1945); Campbell v. Holt, 115 U.S. 620 (1885); see also Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 228 (1995) (\u201c[T]he length and indeed\neven the very existence of a statute of limitations upon a federal cause of\naction is entirely subject to congressional control.\u201d). But Congress changes the terms of a statute of limitations only by enacting a new law, and\nthat change is adopted through the same constitutionally required procedures as the prior one. See U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7. There is no constitutional shortcut that would permit revisions without adoption by both Houses\nand presentment to the President. By the same token, we do not believe\nthat Congress may change the terms upon which an amendment has been\nproposed to the States except by following the same procedures that were\nrequired in connection with the earlier proposal, namely proposal by twothirds majorities and a new round of consideration by the States. Because Congress and the state legislatures are distinct actors in the\nconstitutional amendment process, the 116th Congress may not revise the\nterms under which two-thirds of both Houses proposed the ERA Resolution and under which thirty-five state legislatures initially ratified it. Such\nan action by this Congress would seem tantamount to asking the 116th\nCongress to override a veto that President Carter had returned during the\n92nd Congress, a power this Congress plainly does not have. See Pocket\nVeto Case, 279 U.S. 655, 684\u201385 (1929) (\u201c[I]t was plainly the object of\nthe [relevant] constitutional provision that there should be a timely return\nof the bill, which . . . should enable Congress to proceed immediately with\nits reconsideration [.]\u201d (emphasis added)). Because the 1972 ERA Resolution has lapsed, the only constitutional way for Congress to revive the\nERA, should it seek to do so, would be for two-thirds of both Houses of\nCongress to propose the amendment anew for consideration by the States. IV. In view of our foregoing conclusions, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether the earlier ratifications of the ERA by five state legislatures\nwere validly rescinded. See supra note 8 and accompanying text. The\nquestion of a State\u2019s authority to rescind its ratification, before an\nover again, collecting the necessary number of States to ratify it.\u201d See supra note 1 and\naccompanying text (emphasis added). 36 Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment amendment has been ratified by three-fourths of the States, is a significant\none that has not been resolved. See Ginsburg, 57 Tex. L. Rev. at 920\n(describing the doctrine of rescission as \u201cthe most debatable issue\u201d concerning the ERA\u2019s legal status shortly after the 1978 extension). In\nConstitutionality of ERA Extension, we concluded that the Constitution\ndoes not permit rescissions, even if Congress had changed the ratification\ndeadline after the State had voted upon the amendment.

Freeman disagreed, however, reasoning\nthat Dillon\u2019s interpretation of Article V requires a contemporaneous\nconsensus of the people of the United States, and therefore implies that a\nstate legislature, as the representative of one portion of the people, remains free to change its position until three-fourths of the States have\nagreed in common to support ratification. See 529 F. Supp. at 1146\u201350. The Supreme Court did not reach the question before the extended deadline expired. Although we have disagreed in this opinion with some of the\nconclusions in the 1977 opinion, we believe that the expiration of the\nERA Resolution makes it unnecessary for us to revisit this question. Regardless of the continuing validity of the five States\u2019 ratifications,\nthree-fourths of the States did not ratify the amendment before the deadline that Congress set for the ERA Resolution, and therefore, the 1972\nversion of the ERA has failed of adoption. V.\nFor the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the ERA Resolution\nhas expired and is no longer pending before the States. Even if one or\nmore state legislatures were to ratify the 1972 proposal, that action would\nnot complete the ratification of the amendment, and the ERA\u2019s adoption\ncould not be certified under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 106b. In addition, we conclude\nthat when Congress uses a proposing clause to impose a deadline on the\nStates\u2019 ratification of a proposed constitutional amendment, that deadline\nis binding and Congress may not revive the proposal after the deadline\u2019s\nexpiration. Accordingly, should Congress now \u201cdeem [the ERA] necessary,\u201d U.S. Const. art. V, the only constitutional path for amendment\nwould be for two-thirds of both Houses (or a convention sought by twothirds of the state legislatures) to propose the amendment once more and 37 Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 44 restart the ratification process among the States, consistent with Article V\nof the Constitution.
