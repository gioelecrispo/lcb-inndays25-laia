      "content": "CJS Appropriations Act \u00a7 540, 129 Stat. at\n2332. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that this provision has\nthe effect of barring the Department, for the remainder of fiscal year\n2016, from denying OIG timely access to requested materials pursuant to\nTitle III, Rule 6(e), or section 626 of FCRA, or from preventing or impeding OIG\u2019s access to such materials. As a result, the Department may (and\nmust) disregard the limitations in those statutes in making disclosures to\nOIG for the remainder of the fiscal year. I.\nWe begin with the relevant statutory background and governing legal\nprinciples. With the exception of the subsequently enacted CJS Appropriations Act, these statutes and principles are discussed in depth in this\nOffice\u2019s recent opinion, Access of Department of Justice Inspector General to Certain Information Protected from Disclosure by Statute, 39 Op.\nO.L.C. 12 (2015) (\u201cIG Access\u201d). The Inspector General Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. app. (\u201cIG Act\u201d), established an Office of Inspector General in a large number of federal agencies. 5 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 2(A), 8G(a)\u2013(b), 12(2). In 1988, Congress extended\nthat Act to the Department and established OIG. See Inspector General\nAct Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-504, \u00a7 102(c), (f ), 102 Stat. 2515, 2515, 2520\u201321 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 8E, 12(1)\u2013\n(2)). The IG Act grants inspectors general several authorities with respect\nto the agencies within which their offices are established, including, in\nsection 6(a)(1), the authority \u201cto have access to all records, reports, audits,\nreviews, documents, papers, recommendations, or other material available\nto the applicable establishment which relate to programs and operations\nwith respect to which that Inspector General has responsibilities under\nthis Act.\u201d 5 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 6(a)(1). Section 8E of the Act qualifies this\nauthority in certain circumstances, providing that the Attorney General\nmay \u201cprohibit the Inspector General from carrying out or completing any\naudit or investigation, or from issuing a subpoena . . . if the Attorney\n40 Effect of Appropriations Rider on Access of DOJ Inspector General to Information General determines that such prohibition is necessary to prevent the\ndisclosure\u201d of certain sensitive materials. Id. \u00a7 8E(a)(2). On its face, the\nIG Act thus \u201crequires the Department to disclose \u2018all\u2019 materials [requested\nby OIG] that are available to the Department, relate to an OIG review of\nprograms or operations within its investigative jurisdiction, and are not\ncovered by a determination to withhold them under section 8E.\u201d IG Access, 39 Op. O.L.C. at 20. As we explained in our IG Access opinion, however, the IG Act is \u201cnot\nin all circumstances the only statute that governs OIG\u2019s access to Department materials.\u201d Id. at 19. The three statutes about which you have\nasked\u2014Title III, Rule 6(e), and FCRA\u2014also govern access, including\nOIG\u2019s access, to certain highly sensitive Department materials. Title III\nprovides that an investigative or law enforcement officer \u201cviolat[es]\u201d the\nlaw by \u201cwillful[ly] disclos[ing]\u201d the contents of a lawfully intercepted\nwire, oral, or electronic communication \u201cbeyond the extent permitted by\u201d\nTitle III.",

Rule 6(e) provides that \u201cattorney[s] for the\ngovernment\u201d and other persons \u201cmust not disclose a matter occurring\nbefore [a] grand jury\u201d\u2014such as testimony that witnesses have delivered in\nconfidential grand jury proceedings\u2014except pursuant to a specific exception.

These statutes permit Department officials to disclose covered materials to OIG in \u201cmost, but not all, of the circumstances in which OIG might\nrequest [them].\u201d IG Access, 39 Op. O.L.C. at 15; see id. at 21\u201369 (examining each statute in detail to identify the circumstances in which it permits disclosure to OIG). In particular, Title III and Rule 6(e) allow Department officials to disclose the contents of intercepted communications\nand grand jury materials to OIG in connection with any OIG investigation\nor review that relates to the Department\u2019s criminal law enforcement\nactivities, and section 626 of FCRA allows the FBI to disclose protected\nconsumer information to OIG if the disclosure could assist in the approval\nor conduct of foreign counterintelligence investigations. See id. at 68. But\nthe statutes do not permit disclosures that \u201chave either an attenuated or no\n41 40 Op. O.L.C. 39 (2016) connection\u201d with the Department\u2019s criminal law enforcement activities, or\nthe approval or conduct of foreign counterintelligence investigations. Id.\nat 68. Accordingly, if OIG were to request access to protected materials in\none of those limited circumstances in which Title III, Rule 6(e), or section\n626 prohibits their disclosure, Department officials would face potentially\nconflicting statutory commands. On the one hand, the IG Act states that\nDepartment officials must grant OIG access to \u201call materials\u201d that OIG\nrequests and that fall within OIG\u2019s investigative jurisdiction; on the other\nhand, Title III, Rule 6(e), and section 626 state, respectively, that officials\nwould \u201cviolat[e]\u201d the law by disclosing, \u201cmust not disclose,\u201d or \u201cmay not\ndisseminate\u201d the requested materials. See id. at 19\u201320. In our IG Access opinion, we resolved this conflict by applying two\nwell-established legal principles. First, we observed that \u201cin a range of\ncontexts . . . the Supreme Court and this Office have declined to infer that\nCongress intended to override statutory limits on the disclosure of highly\nsensitive information about which Congress has expressed a special\nconcern for privacy, absent a clear statement of congressional intent to\nthat effect.\u201d Id. at 70. The Court and this Office had previously concluded\nthat this principle required a clear statement before a statute could be\nconstrued to authorize the disclosure of information protected by Rule\n6(e) or Title III\u2014i.e., confidential material (such as witness testimony)\ndeveloped in the course of grand jury proceedings, or the contents of\nprivate communications lawfully wiretapped by the government.

And we concluded in the IG Access opinion that \u201cthe logic of\nthese opinions . . . extends to section 626 of FCRA\u201d as well, given the\n\u201cstrict duty of confidentiality\u201d and the \u201cpenalties for improper disclosure\u201d\nimposed by section 626, as well as the \u201chighly sensitive\u201d nature of the\ninformation section 626 protects\u2014i.e., private consumer banking and\ncredit information obtained by the FBI from credit agencies, frequently\nwithout the consumer\u2019s knowledge. Id. at 73. Second, we invoked the \u201crule of relative specificity,\u201d which holds that\n\u201c\u2018[w]here there is no clear [congressional] intention otherwise, a specific\nstatute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one, regardless of\nthe priority of enactment.\u2019\u201d Id. at 74 (alterations in original) (quoting\nMorton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550\u201351 (1974)).

Accordingly, we concluded that, like the clear statement\nprinciple pertaining to highly sensitive information, the rule of relative\nspecificity \u201crequire[d] a clear statement\u201d before it could be inferred that\n\u201cthe general right of access granted by section 6(a)(1) [of the IG Act]\ntakes precedence over the specific, carefully delineated limits on disclosure Congress set forth in\u201d Title III, Rule 6(e), and section 626. Id. at 78. Applying these two principles, we concluded that the IG Act does not\ncontain such a clear statement. Id. at 79. The Act, we observed, \u201cdoes not\nmention\u201d any of the three withholding statutes, or\ncontain general language addressing potential conflicts with other\nstatutory confidentiality provisions, such as a statement that the inspector general\u2019s right of access shall apply \u2018notwithstanding any\nother law\u2019 or \u2018notwithstanding any statutory prohibition on disclosure\u2019\u2014language that might, at least in some circumstances, provide\na clearer indication that the general access language was supposed to\noverride more specific statutory protections of confidential information. Id. at 79\u201380 (citing Brady Act Implementation Issues, 20 Op. O.L.C. 57,\n62 (1996)). Although the IG Act grants inspectors general a right \u201cto have\naccess to all records\u201d available to their respective agencies and within\ntheir investigative jurisdiction, the Supreme Court and this Office have\nrepeatedly concluded that \u201c\u2018expansive modifiers\u2019\u201d like \u201call\u201d and \u201cany\u201d do\nnot, on their own, supply the kind of clear statement needed to overcome\ncompeting interpretive presumptions.

No. 113-235, 128 Stat. 2130 (2014) (\u201c2015 Appropriations Act\u201d),\ngranted OIG access to information otherwise protected from disclosure by\nTitle III, Rule 6(e), or section 626 of FCRA. Section 218 of the 2015\nAppropriations Act stated: No funds provided in this Act shall be used to deny the Inspector\nGeneral of the Department of Justice timely access to all records,\ndocuments, and other materials in the custody or possession of the\nDepartment or to prevent or impede the Inspector General\u2019s access\nto such records, documents and other materials, unless in accordance\nwith an express limitation of section 6(a) of the Inspector General\nAct, as amended, consistent with the plain language of the Inspector\nGeneral Act, as amended. The Inspector General of the Department\nof Justice shall report to the Committees on Appropriations within\nfive calendar days any failures to comply with this requirement. Id. \u00a7 218, 128 Stat. at 2200. We acknowledged that OIG had made \u201csubstantial\u201d arguments that this rider required the Department to grant it\naccess to materials otherwise protected by Title III, Rule 6(e), and section\n626. IG Access, 39 Op. O.L.C. at 92. But we ultimately concluded that the\nrider did not override Title III, Rule 6(e), and section 626 in the limited\ncircumstances in which those statutes bar OIG\u2019s access to protected information. We began our analysis of section 218 by observing that there were \u201cat\nleast three conceivable constructions of the phrase \u2018express limitation of\nsection 6(a) of the Inspector General Act.\u2019\u201d Id. at 93. First, this phrase\ncould be interpreted to prohibit Department officials from denying OIG\naccess to materials except under \u201climitations\u201d on OIG\u2019s access that \u201cappear in section 6(a) itself or that expressly refer to that section\u201d\u2014a reading that would have barred the Department from withholding materials\nfrom OIG under Title III, Rule 6(e), or section 626 of FCRA, as well as\nunder section 8E of the IG Act itself. Id. Second, the provision could be\ninterpreted\u2014as OIG proposed\u2014to refer to \u201conly those limitations on\ndisclosure that are specifically directed at disclosures to OIG under the IG\nAct, whether or not they explicitly refer to section 6(a).\u201d Id.

Under this reading, the Department would be permitted\nto withhold information under Title III, Rule 6(e), and section 626, as well\nas section 8E of the IG Act. See id. We concluded that the first interpretation, although a natural reading of\nthe phrase \u201cexpress limitation of section 6(a),\u201d was untenable. As noted\nabove, this reading would have meant that the rider had implicitly repealed (among other things) section 8E of the IG Act itself, a provision\nthat \u201cdoes not refer explicitly to section 6(a).\u201d Id. We thought that result\nimplausible in light of the \u201cstrong presumption against implied repeals in\nappropriations acts,\u201d and because other parts of the rider made clear that it\nwas intended to be consistent with the plain language of the Inspector\nGeneral Act. Id. Having found this natural reading of section 218\u2019s key phrase untenable, we went on to consider the second and third readings we had identified.

Although \u201cnot the most natural reading of section 218\u2019s text,\u201d this reading was in our view plausible because\n\u201csection 6(a) is the principal provision in the IG Act that governs disclosures to OIG.\u201d Id. The third reading was likewise \u201creasonably grounded in\nthe statutory text.\u201d Id. at 95. \u201cStatutes like Title III, Rule 6(e), and section\n626\u201d of FCRA, we explained, \u201ccan be considered \u2018limitations of section 6(a)\u2019 in that they supersede section 6(a) in situations where both\nsection 6(a) and one of those statutes would apply.\u201d Id. And they can be\nconsidered \u201cexpress\u201d limitations because \u201cthey explicitly contemplate . . .\nnondisclosure in the circumstances they address\u201d\u2014as opposed to, for\nexample, general statutory provisions that implicitly authorize an agency\nto withhold information, or agency practices grounded in regulations or\nother non-statutory authorities. Id. Although we thought that both the second and the third readings of section 218 were plausible, we concluded that the third was more consistent\nwith the relevant principles of statutory interpretation. We noted that, in\norder to override the limitations on disclosure imposed by Title III, Rule\n45 40 Op.

In a joint explanatory statement, the statute\u2019s\ndrafters explained simply that \u201c[s]ection 540 requires agencies funded by\nthe Act to provide Inspectors General with timely access to information.\u201d 161 Cong.

II. As we explained in the IG Access opinion (and as discussed above), an\nappropriations act may be construed to override the limitations on disclosure contained in Title III, Rule 6(e), and section 626 of FCRA only if the\nact contains a \u201c\u2018clear\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018unambiguous[]\u2019\u201d statement that Congress\nintended it to have that effect. IG Access, 39 Op. O.L.C. at 97; supra\npp. 45\u201346. We conclude that section 540 of the CJS Appropriations Act\n47 40 Op. O.L.C. 39 (2016) contains such a clear and unambiguous statement, and therefore that it\neffectively bars the Department from withholding materials from OIG\npursuant to Title III, Rule 6(e), or section 626 for the remainder of fiscal\nyear 2016. As a result, the Department may (and must) disregard the\nlimitations in those statutes in making disclosures to OIG during the\nremainder of that year. To start, there is no question that section 540 on its face imposes a restriction on the Department\u2019s use of fiscal year 2016 funds to deny, prevent, or impede OIG\u2019s access to Department materials. The first part of\nthat provision states that \u201c[n]o funds provided in this Act shall be used\u201d to\ndeny, prevent, or impede the access of \u201can Inspector General funded\nunder this Act\u201d to materials \u201cavailable to the department or agency over\nwhich the Inspector General has responsibilities under the Inspector\nGeneral Act of 1978.\u201d The \u201cAct\u201d referred to in section 540 is the CJS\nAppropriations Act, which appropriates funds both to the Department\ngenerally and to OIG specifically for fiscal year 2016. See Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2016 \u00a7 3, 129 Stat. at 2244 (\u201cExcept as expressly\nprovided otherwise, any reference to \u2018this Act\u2019 contained in any division\nof this Act shall be treated as referring only to the provisions of that\ndivision.\u201d); CJS Appropriations Act tit.

Furthermore, by prohibiting the Department from using fiscal year\n2016 funds to withhold materials pursuant to Title III, Rule 6(e), or\nsection 626 of FCRA, the appropriations rider effectively prohibits the\nDepartment from withholding materials pursuant to those statutes for the\nremainder of fiscal year 2016.

Moreover, for at least three reasons, we believe section 540\u2019s prohibition on using fiscal year 2016 funds to withhold these materials from We recognize that funds that are not \u201cprovided in\u201d the CJS Appropriations Act, such\nas funds held over from a previous fiscal year, are not subject to section 540.

However, we understand that the\nvast majority of the Department\u2019s salaries and operations are funded by annual appropriations. See, e.g., id. tit.

Thus, even if OIG requested\nmaterials from the Department in the narrow circumstances in which such materials are\nprotected from disclosure to OIG by Title III, Rule 6(e), or section 626, and even if none\nof the Department employees with custody of those materials were paid with fiscal year\n2016 funds or used resources supported by such funds to process the request, OIG\u2019s\nrequest could always be elevated to a supervisory official who was paid with fiscal year\n2016 funds and had the authority to obtain and disclose the materials notwithstanding the\nrestrictions in Title III, Rule 6(e), or section 626. 2 50 Effect of Appropriations Rider on Access of DOJ Inspector General to Information OIG\u2014unlike the analogous provisions in the IG Act or section 218 of the\n2015 Appropriations Act\u2014is \u201c\u2018clear\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018unambiguous[],\u2019\u201d and therefore satisfies the clear statement rules described in our IG Access opinion. IG Access, 39 Op. O.L.C. at 83, 95, 97. First, in our view, the only plausible construction of section 540 is that it forbids the use of fiscal year 2016\nfunds to withhold materials from OIG pursuant to Title III, Rule 6(e), or\nsection 626 of FCRA. As just discussed, section 540 states that the Department may not use such funds to withhold materials from OIG \u201cunder\nany provision of law\u201d except a provision that expressly limits inspector\ngeneral access, and under no reasonable construction does that language\npermit the Department to use fiscal year 2016 funds to withhold materials\nunder Title III, Rule 6(e), or section 626. Thus, unlike section 218 of the\n2015 Appropriations Act, section 540 is not \u201csusceptible to alternative\ninterpretations, one of which would permit withholding under Title III,\nRule 6(e), and section 626,\u201d and it therefore cannot be construed in a\nmanner consistent with those statutes. Id. at 95; see The Last Best Beef,\nLLC v. Dudas, 506 F.3d 333, 339 (4th Cir. 2007) (stating that where an\nappropriations rider is \u201cin absolute contradiction with\u201d an earlier-enacted\nstatute, and an agency \u201csimply cannot comply simultaneously\u201d with both\nenactments, the agency is \u201cbound to follow Congress\u2019s last word on the\nmatter even in an appropriations law\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Second, unlike both section 218 and the IG Act, section 540 expressly\n\u201caddress[es] potential conflicts with other statutory confidentiality provisions.\u201d IG Access, 39 Op.

That language is similar to statutory grants of\naccess \u201cnotwithstanding any other law\u201d that we have previously found\nsufficient, at least in some circumstances, to override competing limitations on disclosure. See, e.g., Brady Act Implementation Issues, 20 Op.\nO.L.C. at 62 (stating that the Brady Act\u2019s grant of access \u201cnotwithstanding any other law\u201d overrides the limitations on disclosure found in the\nPrivacy Act); IG Access, 39 Op.

Third, section 540 sets forth only one circumstance in which it would\npermit the Department to use fiscal year 2016 funds to withhold materials\nfrom OIG: where a provision of law \u201cexpressly refers to the Inspector\nGeneral and expressly limits the Inspector General\u2019s right of access.\u201d CJS\nAppropriations Act \u00a7 540. That narrow exception would be largely superfluous if section 540 did not otherwise prohibit the Department from\nusing such funds to withhold (and thus, in effect, bar the Department from\nwithholding) materials available to the Department pursuant to statutory\nprovisions. And the inclusion of this one exception implies that Congress\ndid not intend to allow others. See, e.g., Hill, 437 U.S. at 188 (stating that\nbecause Congress \u201ccreate[d] a number of limited \u2018hardship exemptions\u2019\u201d\nto the Endangered Species Act, \u201cwe must presume that these were the\nonly \u2018hardship cases\u2019 Congress intended to exempt\u201d); cf.

O.L.C. at 83\u201384 (describing as \u201cplausible\u201d OIG\u2019s argument that the\nIG Act overrode other statutory prohibitions on disclosure based on a\nnegative inference from section 6(b)(1) of the IG Act, but concluding that\n\u201cthe inference OIG invoke[d]\u201d was not sufficiently strong to provide a\n\u201cclear manifestation of congressional intent\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Moreover, section 8E(a) of the IG Act falls comfortably within\nthe exception\u2019s scope. See 5 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 8E(a)(2) (stating that the Attorney General \u201cmay prohibit the Inspector General from carrying out or\ncompleting any audit or investigation, or from issuing any subpena, . . . to\nprevent the disclosure of \u201d certain sensitive information (emphases added)). A straightforward interpretation of section 540 thus does not invite\nthe result we thought \u201cimplausible\u201d when construing section 218 of the\n2015 Appropriations Act\u2014namely, an implied partial repeal of a section\nof the IG Act itself. IG Access, 39 Op. O.L.C. at 93. Finally, to return to the question you asked, it follows directly from this\nprohibition on withholding that the Department may (and must) disregard\nthe limitations in Title III, Rule 6(e), and section 626 of FCRA when it\nmakes disclosures to OIG. As discussed above, for the remainder of the\nfiscal year, section 540 effectively bars the Department from withholding\n52 Effect of Appropriations Rider on Access of DOJ Inspector General to Information materials from OIG under Title III, Rule 6(e), or section 626. And in so\ndoing, section 540 effectively overrides the limitations in those statutes\nwith respect to disclosures to OIG during that period. It is therefore plainly permissible\u2014and indeed required\u2014for the Department to disregard\nthose limitations in making disclosures to OIG for the remainder of the\nfiscal year. III.",
