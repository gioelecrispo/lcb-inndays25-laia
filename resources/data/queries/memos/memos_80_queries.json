As summarized in section 113(a)(3),2 section 113 provides that\nwhen EPA finds that \u201c any person has violated, or is in violation o f \u2019 the Act\nor its implementing regulations, EPA may issue an administrative penalty order\nor a compliance order, bring a civil action, or request the Attorney General to\ncommence a criminal action. The questions presented to us are whether the Act\nauthorizes EPA to issue an administrative penalty order to a federal agency under\nsection 113(d), and if so, whether that authority can be exercised consistent with\nthe Constitution. 3 The Act authorizes EPA to issue two kinds of administrative penalty orders. Section 113(d)(1) authorizes EPA to \u201c issue an administrative order against any\nperson assessing a civil administrative penalty of up to $25,000, per day of viola\u00ad\ntion\u201d when EPA \u201c finds that such person\u201d has violated the Act or its imple\u00ad\nmenting regulations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413(d)(1). Such a penalty may be assessed only\nafter opportunity for a hearing on the record in accordance with the Administrative\nProcedure Act (\u201c APA\u201d ), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7554, 556 (1994). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413(d)(2). In addition, section 113(d)(3) authorizes EPA to implement a field citation pro\u00ad\ngram under which \u201c persons\u201d who commit minor violations of the Act or the\nregulations may receive field citations assessing civil penalties not to exceed\n$5,000 per day. Id. \u00a7 7413(d)(3). Field citations may be issued without a hearing,\nbut persons who have received citations may request a hearing. \u201c Such hearing\nshall not be subject to [the APA], but shall provide a reasonable opportunity to\nbe heard and to present evidence.\u201d Id. The Act provides for the two types of\nadministrative penalty orders to be litigated in the courts in a variety of ways. Persons against whom either kind o f penalty is imposed may seek judicial review\nin federal district court, and in any such proceeding the United States may seek\nan order requiring that the penalties be paid. Id. \u00a7 7413(d)(4). In addition, if a\nperson fails to pay any penalty after receiving an order or assessment from EPA,\n\u201c the Administrator shall request the Attorney General to bring a civil action in\nan appropriate district court to enforce the order or to recover the amount ordered\nor assessed.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7413(d)(5).

DOD rejects EPA\u2019s argument that the inclusion of federal\nagencies in the Act\u2019s general definition of \u201c person\u201d constitutes \u201c a sufficiently\nexpress statement to allow [EPA] to exercise enforcement authority against other\nExecutive Branch agencies.\u201d Id. at 5.\nII. We agree with DOD that the interpretation of the Clean Air Act advanced by\nEPA \u2014 that EPA is authorized to initiate enforcement proceedings under section\n113(d) against federal agencies \u2014 raises substantial separation of powers concerns,\nthus warranting application of the clear statement principle. in 1994, this Office was asked whether the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment ( \u201c HUD\u201d ) has the authority under the Fair Housing Act to initiate\nenforcement proceedings against other federal agencies.",

Our insistence in the Fair Housing Act Opinion that the statute must \u2018\u2018contain[ ]\nan express statement that Congress intended HUD to have such authority\u201d was\nconsistent with a long line of opinions of the Supreme Court and this Office that\nrequire a clear statement of congressional intent when separation of powers or\nfederalism concerns would be raised. Many of these opinions are cited in an\nopinion that we issued subsequent to the Fair Housing Act Opinion. See Applica\u00ad\ntion o f 28 U.S.C. \u00a7458 to Presidential Appointments o f Federal Judges, 19 Op.\nO.L.C. 350 (1995) (concluding that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7458 (1994), which prohibits\nappointment or employment of relatives of judges in same court, does not apply\n112 A d m inistrative A ssessm ent o f C ivil P enalties'A gainst F ederal A g en cies Under the Clean A ir A ct to presidential appointments of judges).

Based on the foregoing discussion, we must find a clear statement of congres\u00ad\nsional intent before we can conclude that the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to\ninitiate enforcement proceedings against other executive branch agencies. As dis\u00ad\ncussed below, we believe that the statutory text provides a very strong basis for\nfinding a clear statement of such intent and that this conclusion is fully supported\nby the legislative history of the Act, particularly the 1977 amendment of the defi\u00ad\nnition of \u201c person\u201d to include federal agencies. A straightforward review of the relevant provisions of the Clean Air Act\u2019s statu\u00ad\ntory text supports EPA\u2019s position that the statute gives EPA authority to assess\ncivil penalties against federal agencies administratively. EPA\u2019s authority under\nsection 113(d) is available with respect to \u201c persons\u201d who violate the Act.5 The\nterm \u201c person\u201d is defined in section 302(e): \u201c When used in [the Clean Air Act]\n. . .

We have also reviewed the evolution of the relevant provisions\nof the Clean Air Act as reflected by various amendments to the Act over the\nyears. As discussed below, that history fully supports the conclusion that Congress\ncontemplated EPA enforcement against other federal agencies. 5 Section 113(d)(1) provides for assessment o f civil penalties against \u201c persons\u201d . \u2018\u2018The Administrator may issue\nan administrative order against any person\n\u201d 42 U S C \u00a7 7413(d)( 1) Section 113(d)(3) achieves the same\nresult, but uses indirect language \u201c The Administrator may implement\na field citation program . . .

L. No. 101-549, \u00a7701, 104 Stat. 2399, 2677-79. We have reviewed\nthe legislative history of the 1990 Amendments and have found no discussion\nof the application of those provisions to federal agencies. We have not limited\nour legislative history review to the 1990 Amendments, however, because the\nadministrative enforcement authorities provided by those amendments merely\nsupplemented the enforcement authorities EPA already had with respect to \u201c per\u00ad\nsons\u201d under the other provisions of section 113. Thus, Congress\u2019s intent in pro\u00ad\nviding EPA those other authorities is controlling. EPA\u2019s other enforcement authorities under section 113 originated with the Clean\nAir Act Amendments of 1970 (\u201c the 1970 Amendments\u201d ), Pub. L. No. 91-604,\n\u00a74(a), 84 Stat. 1676, 1686-87. As with the current version of section 113, the\n1970 version authorized federal enforcement against \u201c persons.\u201d However, at that\ntime the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cperson\u201d did not include agencies of the federal\ngovernment. 6 The 1970 Amendments also revised section 118 of the Act to make\nfederal agencies subject to the substantive requirements of the Act: \u201c [Federal\nagencies] shall comply with Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements\nrespecting control and abatement o f air pollution to the same extent that any per\u00ad\nson is subject to such requirements.\u201d Id. \u00a75, 84 Stat. at 1689.7 Thus, the 1970\nversion of section 118 referred only to federal agencies complying with sub\u00ad\nstantive requirements; it did not contain any language subjecting federal agencies\nto enforcement authority.",

Nor are federal agencies limited to using the hearing process to raise a dispute to the appropriate level within the executive branch:\nfederal agencies will have the opportunity to consult with the EPA Administrator\nbefore any assessment is final, see id., and the Attorney General could seek to\nresolve the matter if either EPA or the respondent federal agency sought to litigate\nthe matter, see id. at 6. The critical point for constitutional purposes is that the Act does not preclude\nthe President from authorizing any process he chooses to resolve disputes between\nEPA and other federal agencies regarding the assessment of administrative pen\u00ad\nalties. \u201c [I]t is not inconsistent with the Constitution for an executive agency to\nimpose a penalty on another executive agency pursuant to its statutory authority\nso long as the President is not deprived of his opportunity to review the matter.\u201d NRC Opinion, 13 Op. O.L.C. at 136-37. DOD attempts to distinguish our NRC Opinion, which concluded that the\nadministrative enforcement authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n(\u201c NRC\u201d ) under the Atomic Energy Act, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a72282 (1994), could be\nexercised against federal agencies consistent with Article II.

It notes that the Atomic\nEnergy Act contains an express authorization to the Attorney General, in cir\u00ad\ncumstances where the NRC has requested that the Attorney General institute a\ncivil action to collect a penalty, \u201c to compromise, mitigate, or remit such civil\npenalties.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72282(c). See DOD Response at 10-11. DOD then asserts\nthat the Clean Air Act is different because it \u2018\u2018limits the discretion of the Attorney\nGeneral to compromise, mitigate or remit a penalty assessment.\u201d Id. DOD appar\u00ad\nently bases that assertion on the language in section 113(d)(5) stating that in any\ncivil action \u2018\u2018the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such order or assessment\nshall not be subject to review.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413(d)(5). DOD\u2019s assertion that the Clean Air Act limits the Attorney General\u2019s discretion\nis incorrect. Section 113(d)(5) acts as a limitation only on the authority of the\ncourts in any action that is brought before the courts. It is not a limitation on\nthe Attorney General, acting under Executive Order No. 12146 or any litigation\nreview process, o r\u2014 more to the point \u2014 the President acting through whatever\nexecutive branch process he may authorize. The absence of any limitation on the\nPresident\u2019s discretion is the dispositive factor for constitutional purposes, and in\nthat respect the two statutory regimes are the same. Neither statute precludes reso\u00ad\n116 A dm inistrative A ssessm ent o f Civil P enalties A gainst F ederal A gencies Under the Clean A ir A ct lution within the executive branch, including resolution by the President, of dis\u00ad\nputes between the enforcement agency and other federal agencies. 9\nB.\nEPA acknowledges that the civil action provisions contained in sections\n113(d)(4) and 113(d)(5) of the Act, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7413(d)(4), 7413(d)(5),\n\u201c raise the possibility of one executive branch agency suing another in federal\ncourt over the administrative penalty,\u201d EPA Memorandum at 9, but it takes the\nposition that \u201c [t]he constitutional concerns . . . could be avoided by an interpreta\u00ad\ntion that the general reference to review in federal district court reasonably means\nonly judicial review that was otherwise constitutional.\u201d Id. In particular, EPA\nemphasizes that \u201c nothing in the Clean Air Act mandates that two executive branch\nagencies end up in federal court. There is at most an opportunity for any agency\nto seek judicial review, and a requirement that EPA \u2018request\u2019 that the Attorney\nGeneral file a collection action.\u201d Id. EPA concludes that \u201c the mere possibility\nthat an interagency lawsuit might result does not invalidate an agency\u2019s ability\nto assess civil penalties against another executive branch agency, where the\nAttorney General has adequate discretion to control the filing of such a lawsuit.\u201d Id. at 10.",

As stated in Section II of this opinion, \u201c this Office has consistently said that\n\u2018lawsuits between two federal agencies are not generally justiciable.\u2019 \u201d Fair\nHousing Act Opinion, 18 Op.

We agree with EPA,\nhowever, that this Article III barrier to use of the civil action remedies of section\n113(d) is not a barrier to EPA\u2019s exercise of its administrative enforcement\nauthority under the Act. Put another way, we agree that the administrative\nauthority can be exercised consistent with Article HI. The Act does not require\nthat civil actions be brought in the event of a dispute of an assessment by EPA;\nit merely authorizes the bringing of such actions. Thus, as is the case with the comparable provisions contained in the Atomic\nEnergy Act, which we concluded in our NRC opinion could be applied consistent\nwith Article III, \u201c this constitutional issue need not arise, because the framework\n9 Nor does ihe Clean Air A ct\u2019s citizen suit provision operate to preclude resolution within the executive branch\nSection 304 provides thai \u201c any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf . . against any person\n(including\nthe United States\n) who is alleged\nto be in violation of .

If the Attorney General and\nthe President determine that no civil penalties should be collected,\nthe Attorney General may simply refrain from bringing a lawsuit. If the Attorney General determines that certain civil penalties are\nappropriate, however, the Attorney General would still not bring\na lawsuit because of the constitutional problems noted above. Rather, procedures internal to the executive branch are adequate\nto resolve the dispute through the determination that [the federal\nagency responsible for the federal facility] is liable. Id. at 143. The only difference between the two statutes that is relevant to the Article III\nquestion is that section 113(d)(4) of the Clean Air Act would also authorize the\nagency responsible for the federal facility to initiate a civil action to contest an\nEPA administrative order. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413(d)(4). The difference is not\nsignificant for constitutional purposes, however, because, as we have explained,\nthe Act is permissive only and does not require any federal agency to bring a\ncivil action. Moreover, the Attorney General and the President possess the\nauthority to forestall litigation between executive branch entities. The Attorney\nGeneral is responsible for conducting litigation on behalf of most federal agencies\nand therefore can ensure that no civil action is filed by those agencies against\nanother federal entity. We would expect that the relatively few federal agencies\nthat have relevant independent litigating authority similarly would decline to file\ncivil actions, consistent with the conclusions set forth in this memorandum.
