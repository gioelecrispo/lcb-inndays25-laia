The Supreme Court has expressly (and unanimously) recognized\nthat the Constitution gives the President the power to protect the confidentiality\nof White House deliberations. This power is rooted in the \u201c need for protection\nof communications between high Government officials and those who advise and\nassist them in the performance of their manifold duties.\u201d United States v. Nixon,\n418 U.S. 683, 705 (1974). \u201c A President and those who assist him must be free\nto explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions\nand to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately.\u201d\nId. at 708. The Court has also stressed the separation of powers nature of executive\nprivilege, stating that \u201c [t]he privilege is fundamental to the operation of Govern\u00ad\nment and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.\u201d\nId.\n\n324\n\n\fApplicability o f Executive Privilege to Deliberations Regarding Assertion o f Privilege\n\nYou have not inquired concerning whether executive privilege could properly\nbe asserted in the context of any specific congressional demand for these docu\u00ad\nments.\nCHRISTOPHER H. SCHROEDER\nActing Assistant Attorney General\nOffice o f Legal Counsel\n\n325",
