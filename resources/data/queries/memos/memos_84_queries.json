W e conclude that the agencies lack such authority. 2\nI.\nThe purpose of the CRA is \u201cto require each appropriate Federal financial super\u00ad\nvisory agency to use its authority when exam ining financial institutions, to encour\u00ad\nage such institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local com m unities in\nwhich they are chartered consistent with the safe and sound operation of such in\u00ad\nstitutions.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2901(b). To further this end, the CRA requires the agen\u00ad\ncies to assess an \u201cinstitution\u2019s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire\ncom m unity,\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2903(a)(1), and to \u201ctake such record into account in its\nevaluation of an application for a deposit facility by such institution.\u201d 12 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2903(a)(2). \u201c[A pplication for a deposit facility\u201d is defined to include applica\u00ad\ntions for approval to open a branch, to relocate a main or branch office, or to\nmerge with or acquire another institution. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2902(3). The agencies\nmust prepare a written evaluation of each institution\u2019s performance under the CRA,\nassign a rating to that performance, and disclose that rating to the public. 12\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2906.

S ee Community Reinvestment Act Regulations, 58 Fed. Reg.\n67,466-67,508 (1993). The proposed regulations provide that financial institutions\n\u201chave a continuing and affirmative obligation to help m eet the credit needs o f their\ncomm unities, including low- and m oderate-incom e areas, consistent with safe and\nsound operations.\u201d S ee id. at 67,479 (\u00a7 25.2). The proposed regulations state that\nan institution rated by an agency to be in \u201cSubstantial N oncom pliance\u201d with that\nobligation shall be subject to enforcement actions under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818, which\nauthorizes the agencies to issue cease-and-desist orders and levy civil monetary\npenalties. See id. at 67,480 (\u00a7 25.6(b)). The potential monetary penalties the in\u00ad\nstitutions would face range from not more than $5,000 a day for each day during\nwhich a \u201cfirst tier\u201d violation continues to a m aximum daily penalty of $1,000,000\nor one percent o f the institution\u2019s total assets, whichever is lower, for a \u201cthird tier\u201d\nviolation. S ee 12 U .S.C. \u00a7 1818(i)(2). As discussed below, we do not believe that the agencies are authorized to bring\nactions under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818 to enforce the CRA. O ur conclusion is based on\nthe clearly expressed intent of C ongress in enacting the CRA,3 and rests on two\nindependent rationales: (1) the CRA application evaluation procedure is the exclu\u00ad\nsive enforcem ent m echanism authorized by Congress; and (2) enforcem ent under\n12 U .S.C. \u00a7 1818 is unavailable because the CRA does not impose an obligation\nthat could provide the basis for a \u00a7 1818 action or authorize the agencies to impose\nsuch an obligation. II. W e believe that Congress has plainly spoken on the question o f what enforce\u00ad\nm ent tools are available to the agencies under the CRA. The CRA provides for\nenforcem ent only in the application context, requiring that the agencies shall take\nan institution\u2019s record of meeting the credit needs of its community into account\nwhen evaluating that institution\u2019s application for a deposit facility. Congress speci\u00ad\nfied only this one enforcem ent mechanism in the CRA, and we do not believe it is\nperm issible for the agencies to em ploy other enforcem ent mechanisms, on the\nauthority o f the CRA, in the absence o f some basis in the text of the statute.

The CRA contains no express directive for the agencies to use any other modes\nof enforcement, much less such coercive enforcem ent as cease-and-desist orders\nand monetary penalties, and there is no basis for inferring such authority from any\nprovision in the statute. The statute\u2019s only general grant of authority to the agen\u00ad\ncies is the authority to promulgate im plem enting regulations. We reject the argu\u00ad\nment that a delegation of broad enforcement authority can be inferred from the\nstatute\u2019s delegation of authority to issue implementing regulations and the fact that\nthe CRA does not explicitly state that the agencies may only sanction financial in\u00ad\nstitutions through the application process.",

The legislative history o f the CRA firmly supports our conclusion that the CRA\ndoes not authorize the agencies to employ other methods of enforcement. Neither\nthe House Conference Report nor the Senate Report makes any mention of a\nmethod of sanction other than through the application process,4 and when intro\u00ad\nducing the bill on the Senate floor, Senator Proxmire stated that \u201c[t]he require\u00ad\nments in the bill apply only to applications otherwise required under existing law\nor regulations and do not provide any new authority to the bank regulatory agen\u00ad\ncies.\u201d 123 Cong.

To move from an enforcement scheme that relies upon a\nsystem o f regulatory incentives to a scheme that entails cease-and-desist orders and\npotentially substantial monetary penalties is a leap that we do not believe can be\njustified on the basis o f the text, purpose, and legislative history of the CRA.

By its terms, the CRA provides only that the agencies must evaluate an institu\u00ad\ntion\u2019s record of meeting the credit needs of the community, that the agencies must\ntake that record into account when considering an institution\u2019s application for per\u00ad\nmission to merge or expand, and that the agencies must prepare a written record of\ntheir evaluations for public dissemination. Nowhere does the CRA expressly im\u00ad\npose any obligation on financial institutions themselves. The statute\u2019s references\nto financial institutions are couched in precatory rather than mandatory terms.

The authority to\n\u201cencourage\u201d does not include the authority to impose an obligation enforceable by\ncease-and-desist orders and money penalties. See N ew York v. H eckler , 719 F.2d\n1191, 1196 (2nd Cir. 1983) (holding that statutory language directing entities re\u00ad\nceiving federal funding \u201cto encourage family participation\u201d in m inors\u2019 receipt of\ncontraceptive services did not authorize HHS to promulgate regulations requiring\nparental notification following a m inor\u2019s purchase of contraception). W e em phasize that our conclusion that \u00a7 1818 sanctions are not available is\nnot intended to suggest that the provisions of the proposed CRA regulations re\u00ad\ngarding an obligation to help meet the credit needs of the community are invalid\nfor other purposes under the CRA or any other statute, such as to assist the exercise\nof agency authority during examinations and in the application process. Nor is it\n254 A uthority o f the F ederal F inancial Supervisory A gencies U nder the C om m unity R einvestm ent A ct intended to suggest that other provisions of the proposed CRA regulations impos\u00ad\ning requirements on financial institutions, such as data collection and reporting\nrequirements, are not authorized by the grant of authority to promulgate regula\u00ad\ntions. Moreover, we express no opinion on the availability of \u00a7 1818 sanctions for\nviolations of a law, rule, or regulation in any context other than the CRA. IV. The purpose of the CRA is to require the federal financial supervisory agencies,\nin the execution of their examination function, to encourage financial institutions to\nmeet community credit needs. The CRA requires that the agencies assess financial\ninstitutions\u2019 records in this regard and consider their records when evaluating their\napplications for deposit facilities. In connection with this requirement, the agen\u00ad\ncies may promulgate regulations placing reasonable requirements on financial in\u00ad\nstitutions to enable the agencies to assess their performance.",
