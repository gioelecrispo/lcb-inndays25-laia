(\u201c CCC\u201d )\nto negotiate licenses with the Department of Commerce and other federal govern\u00ad\nment agencies, pursuant to which such agencies would, in exchange for a fee,\nobtain permission to reproduce certain copyrighted materials by photocopying.' See Letter for Dawn E. Johnsen, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of\nLegal Counsel, from Andrew J.

You inform us that a \u201c key factor\nin our decision whether such negotiations [with the CCC] even are appropriate\nis whether there are any circumstances under which the Copyright Act might\nrequire a government agency to obtain such a license: if a license is never nec\u00ad\nessary, there would be no reason to consider entering into negotiations with the\nCCC, or with individual authors of works.\u201d Id. Accordingly, you have asked for\nour opinion on the following question: \u201c whether a government agency ever is\nrequired to secure either permission or licensing before making unauthorized\nreproduction and use of materials that are protected by copyright law, or whether\nall government reproduction and use of such materials per se qualifies for the\n\u2018fair use\u2019 exception from the obligations of the Copyright Act.\u201d Id.

The license fee is based on a limited photocopying survey that accounts for the\nlicense\u2019s employee population and the copying fees for the journals regularly copied by that licensee Upon payment\nof the fee, the licensee is authorized for a specified term to make unlimited numbers of photocopies, for internal\nuse, from CCC-registered publications",

As we explain below, while government reproduction of copyrighted material\nfor governmental use would in many contexts be noninfringing because it would\nbe a \u201c fair use\u201d under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n(1994), there is no \u201c per se\u201d rule under which such government reproduction of\ncopyrighted material invariably qualifies as a fair use. 2 It is important to note,\nhowever, that we have been unable to discern any disagreement within the federal\ngovernment on this specific question: To our knowledge, no agency of the execu\u00ad\ntive branch has argued, or advised, that government copying is per se a fair use. In particular, the Department o f Justice did not urge such a categorical rule in\nthe Williams & Wilkins litigation, see infra note 15 (brief for the United States\nin the Supreme Court did not dispute that photocopying by the government may\nin some circumstances constitute copyright infringement); and, to our knowledge,\nthe Department has not thereafter proffered any arguments, nor provided any\nadvice, inconsistent with the views expressed in that brief. 3 We do not, in this opinion, reach any conclusions about the circumstances under\nwhich government agencies should negotiate to obtain photocopying licenses. We\ncaution, however, that a general practice of government agencies entering into\nlicensing agreements in which they pay licensing fees for uses that are fair may,\nover time, undermine the government\u2019s ability to argue successfully that such uses\nare fair. For this and other reasons, government agencies may wish to ensure that,\nif they do negotiate licensing arrangements, such arrangements cover only those\ngovernment photocopying practices that otherwise would, in fact, be infringing. In Part I of this opinion, we provide some background on the fair use doctrine. In Part II, we review the case law regarding government photocopying and fair\nuse, as well as Congress\u2019s enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976, and conclude\nthat government photocopying o f copyrighted materials does not invariably qualify\nas a fair use. Finally, in Part III, we provide some guidance on the factors that\nan agency should consider in determining whether a particular photocopying prac\u00ad\ntice would be a fair use and whether to negotiate a license with respect to par\u00ad\nticular photocopying practices. 2 In framing the particular question you have asked us to consider, you refer to \u201c unauthorized reproduction and\nuse o f materials that are protected by copyright law.\u201d Pincus Letter at 1.",

Fair Use and Government Photocopying The federal government can be liable for violation of the copyright laws.

However, there is no basis for concluding that\nthe photocopying of copyrighted materials by the federal government automati\u00ad\ncally or invariably constitutes a fair use. The case law provides very little guidance on the question of when government\nphotocopying is a fair use. Reported cases involving application of the fair use\ndoctrine to governmental conduct are rare. Indeed, the Williams & Wilkins deci\u00ad\nsion, to which your letter refers and which we discuss below, is one of the only\npublished opinions containing a significant discussion of governmental fair use. 8 And, outside the context of public schools, we have found only one case \u2014\ninvolving circumstances far removed from those at issue in this opinion \u2014 in\nwhich a court has rejected a government\u2019s assertion that its use of copyrighted\nmaterials was fair. 9 What is more, even outside the context of governmental use,\n6 See also H.R.

Williams & Wilkins appealed to the Supreme Court. In that Court, the Depart\u00ad\nment of Justice argued that the Court of Claims correctly analyzed the fair use\nquestion, and that the Court should affirm the judgment in favor of the United\nStates.

An equally divided Court,\nwithout opinion, affirmed the low er court judgment. See 420 U.S. 376 (1975). Congress was well aware of the dispute in Williams & Wilkins and of the Court\no f Claims\u2019 plea that Congress enact legislation to resolve the difficult fair use\nquestions raised in that case. See, e.g., Senate Report at 71. And, in the 1976\nAct, Congress did take three steps with respect to the matter of photocopying. First, in section 106 of the Act, Congress expressly affirmed that the rights of\na copyright owner include the rights \u201c to reproduce the copyrighted work in\ncopies\u201d and to \u201c authorize\u201d such reproduction.",

In answering that question, there is an\ninescapable tension. On the one hand, because of the highly fact-bound nature\nof the fair use inquiry, it is difficult to ascertain in advance which governmental\npractices will, or will not, be fair uses: There is an \u201c endless variety of situations\nand combinations of circumstances that can rise in particular cases.\u201d",

Such uncertainty, when viewed\nin isolation, might weigh in favor of entering into relatively broad licensing agree\u00ad\nments, so as to ensure that an agency\u2019s photocopying will never be infringing. On the other hand, and in addition to the desire to avoid unnecessary costs, there\nis an important legal consideration that counsels against entering into unnecessary\nlicensing agreements and in favor of limiting such agreements to encompass only\nthose photocopying practices that are infringing \u2014 namely, the concern that gen\u00ad\neral custom and usage may be integral to the fair use analysis.16 Indeed, at least\none court has opined, in particular, that whether it is \u201c fair,\u201d under the copyright\nlaw, to engage in a photocopying practice without compensation may depend,\nin part, on whether similarly situated entities customarily agree to pay a fee to\nthe copyright holders. 17 We have no occasion here to consider whether that court\nwas correct in this regard; but it is possible that other courts may follow suit. Accordingly, if government agencies routinely agree to pay licensing fees to\nengage in photocopying practices that were fair uses at the time, there is a chance\nsome courts may conclude that a growing or longstanding custom o f paying such\nfees weighs against a finding that such photocopying practices are fair uses when\nunlicensed. Thus, an agency that decides to negotiate a photocopying license\nshould seek to limit the scope of the licensing agreement so as not to cover those\nphotocopying practices that the agency, in good faith, concludes are not infringing. In the end, each agency must do its best to evaluate whether any o f its\nphotocopying practices are infringing, and, if so, to obtain proper authorization\nfor such uses of copyrighted materials. Although, as we have explained, there\nmay be many government photocopying practices that are fair uses (or that are,\nfor other reasons, not infringing), under some circumstances government\nphotocopying may not be a fair use. In evaluating whether their practices are\ninfringing, agencies should be guided by Williams & Wilkins, which, as noted\nabove, is still binding precedent in the Federal Circuit. However, as explained\nabove, the holding in Williams & Wilkins itself was dependent on the particular\nfacts of that case, and the 8150 calculus may be different with respect to govern\u00ad\n16 See, e g , Williams & Wilkins * 487 F 2 d at 1355-56, see also Harper & Row, 471 U S . at 550 (the fair use\ndoctnne traditionally \u201c was predicated on the author\u2019s implied consent to \u2018reasonable and customary\u2019 use when he\nreleased his work for public consum ption\u201d )\n17 See Princeton Univ.",

Even if the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit were to adopt the reasoning of these decisions,\nthe rationale of those decisions would not apply with full force in the context\nof government photocopying, since the decisions each rested, in part, on the fact\nthat each of the defendants \u201c acquire[d] conspicuous financial rewards from its\nuse of the copyrighted material.\u201d Id. at 922; see also Princeton Univ.

Nevertheless, the ongoing debate among the judges in cases such as these (and\nin W illiams & Wilkins) demonstrates that the boundaries of fair use in the\nphotocopying context are uncertain, highly contested, and especially dependent\nupon the particulars of a given case. And, while in some cases it might be fairly\neasy for an agency to determine that a government practice is noninfringing,19\nusually that will not be the case: Whether a particular government photocopying\npractice is a fair use often will depend upon a \u201c \u2018sensitive balancing of\n18 M oreover, the subsequent advent of the CCC, and the possibility of reasonable licensing agreements with that\norganization, may affect at least one of the factors that led the Court of Claims to rule against the copyright holder\nin Williams & Wilkins.",

Similarly, in order to determine whether\nany other benefits to the broader public interest would sufficiently outweigh the\ncosts of any reduction in the incentives for creativity, it is necessary to engage\nin a comprehensive evaluation of all pertinent factors. We think that, in the par\u00ad\nticular context of government photocopying, the following specific considerations\n(each of which bears on the four enumerated statutory factors) might have a\nsignificant impact on the fair use calculus:\n(a)\nOne important consideration that courts typically address under the first\nstatutory factor (\u201c the purpose and character of the use, including whether such\nuse is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes\u201d ) is whether\nthe use in question is undertaken in order to increase the user\u2019s profits. In most,\nif not all, cases, the purposes for which the government makes photocopies do\nnot include profitmaking or commercial exploitation. Although the nonprofit\nnature of the government\u2019s use of photocopies would not be dispositive, see\nCampbell, 510 U.S. at 584, it certainly would be \u201c one element,\u201d id., germane\nto the fair use question. 25 The commercial/nonprofit distinction may be especially\nsignificant where, as in most cases of photocopying, the secondary use is not\n\u201c transformative\u201d \u2014 i.e., where the copyrighted material is merely copied in its\noriginal form and is not transformed into another valuable product. See id. at 579\n(the more transformative the use, the less significant to the analysis will be the\nquestion of commercialism). 26\n\u201c courts might regard as fair\u201d the \u201c reproduction o f a [copynghted] work in legislative or judicial proceedings or\nreports\u201d ), reprinted in 1976 U.S C.C.A N. at 5678-79; Senate Report at 61-62 (same).

Accordingly, even where the government copies materials that contain protected\n\u201c expression,\u201d or factual compilations that arrange or select facts in a manner\nsufficiently original to trigger some limited, \u201c thin\u201d copyright protection,29 the\nphotocopying more likely will be a fair use if the purpose of the copying is simply\nto obtain, collect, or study the facts and ideas contained in the materials. This\nwill be the case especially where, for purposes of photocopying, the facts and\nideas cannot readily be segregated from the protected expression, and where the\ngovernment\u2019s copying of the protected expression therefore is merely incidental\nto its copying of unprotected facts and ideas.30\n(e) The fourth factor that the statute expressly identifies as relevant to the fairuse analysis is the \u201c effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of\nthe copyrighted work.\u201d This factor requires courts \u201c to consider not only the extent\nof the market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but\nalso \u2018whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the\ndefendant . . . would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential\nmarket\u2019 for the original.\u201d Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 (quoting 3 Nimmer\n\u00a7 13.05[A][4], at 13-102.61 (1993)). The importance of this factor \u201c will vary,\nnot only with the amount of harm, but also with the relative strength of the\nshowing on the other [fair-use] factors.\u201d Id. at 590 n.21.\n29\u201c [T]he copynght in a factual compilation is thin,\u201d extending only to the selection or arrangement of the facts,\nif any, that is original or expressive Feist, 499 U S at 348 As the Court explained The mere fact that a work is copynghted does not mean that every element of the work may be protected\nOriginality remains the sine qua non of copyright, accordingly, copyright protection may extend only to\nthose components o f a work that are original to the author. . . Thus, if the compilation author clothes\nfacts with an onginal collocation o f words, he or she may be able to claim a copynght in this written\nexpression.

By analogy, in the context\nof publication (rather than mere reproduction) o f copynghted materials, the Supreme Court has indicated that it\nmay be permissible to copy protected expression verbatim where \u201c necessary adequately to convey the facts,\u201d or\nwhere particular expression is \u201c so integral to the idea expressed as to be inseparable from it \u201d Harper & Row,\n471 U S at 563, see also Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv L Rev. at 1113-15. Perhaps the most\nfamous case of this sort is Time Inc v Bernard Geis A sso cs, 293 F. Supp. 130 (S D N Y 1968), in which the\ncourt held that it was fair use to depict frames from the copyrighted Zapruder film in a book about the Kennedy\nassassination, where there was \u201c a public interest in having the fullest information available on the murder of President\nKennedy,\u201d and where such photographs made the author\u2019s theory o f the assassination \u201c easier to understand,\u201d id\nat 146. 103 Opinions o f the Office o f L egal Counsel in Volume 23 The most obvious way in which copying can have an adverse market effect\nis where it directly curtails demand for purchase of the original work, such as\nwhere an entity uses photocopying in lieu of additional subscriptions of the\noriginal work that it otherwise would purchase. See, e.g., Texaco , 60 F.3d at 92729. Furthermore, with the advent of the CCC, it now can be argued that the failure\nto pay a licensing fee for the photocopying of materials covered by the CCC\nhas an adverse effect on another potential \u201c market\u201d that was not present at the\ntime of W illiams & Wilkins \u2014 namely, the potential \u201c licensing fee\u201d market.

Because this sort of \u201c harm \u201d to a licensing fee \u201c market\u201d could, by definition,\nexist whenever an entity refuses to provide the requested compensation for its\ncopies, what is significant is not the simple question of whether any such market\nharm exists, but rather, the magnitude and effect of the harm. \u201c Market harm is\na matter of degree.\u201d Campbell, 510 U.S. at 590 n.21.31 Harm to this potential\n\u201c licensing fee\u201d market, like other forms of market harm, should be germane to\nthe fair-use analysis only if, and to the extent that, such harm would deter \u201c \u2018the\ncreation and publication of edifying matter.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 578 n.10 (quoting Leval,\nToward a F air Use, 103 Harv. L. Rev. at 1134). If \u201c unrestricted and widespread\n[photocopying] o f the sort engaged in by the [government],\u201d Campbell, 510 U.S.\nat 590 (internal quotation marks omitted) would not appreciably alter the incen\u00ad\ntives to create and disseminate the underlying works (and other \u201c edifying\u201d\noriginal creations), the harm to the fee \u201c market\u201d should have correspondingly\nlimited impact when evaluating this fair use factor. Conclusion There is no \u201c per se\u201d rule that government reproduction of copyrighted mate\u00ad\nrial\u2014 including, in particular, government photocopying of copyrighted materials\nfor internal government use \u2014 automatically qualifies as a fair use under section\n107 of the Copyright Act of 1976. However, government photocopying would\nin many contexts be noninfringing because it would be a \u201c fair use\u201d ; and there\nare good reasons that, if an agency decides to negotiate photocopying licensing\nagreements, it should seek to limit the scope of any such arrangement to cover\nonly those government photocopying practices that otherwise would, in fact, be\ninfringing.
