      "content": "Applicability of Ineligibility Clause to Appointment of\nCongressman Tony P. Hall\nThe Ineligibility Clause of the Constitution would not bar the President from appointing Congressman\nTony P. Hall as United States Representative to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture, with the rank of Ambassador. May 30, 2002 MEMORANDUM OPINION FOR THE DEPUTY COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT You have asked for our opinion whether the Ineligibility Clause, U.S. Const.\nart. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 2, would bar the President from appointing Congressman Tony P.\nHall as United States Representative to the United Nations Agencies for Food and\nAgriculture, with the rank of Ambassador. As we previously advised you orally,\nwe believe that the Ineligibility Clause would not bar the appointment. Under the Ineligibility Clause, \u201c[n]o Senator or Representative shall, during the\nTime for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the\nAuthority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments\nwhereof shall have been encreased during such time.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 2.\nCongressman Hall\u2019s current term began January 3, 2001, see U.S. Const. amend. XX, \u00a7 1; 146 Cong. Rec. D1228 (Dec. 15, 2000), and he thus cannot be appointed\nto an office \u201cthe Emoluments whereof\u201d were raised after that date. 1 The office of United States Representative to the United Nations Agencies for\nFood and Agriculture was created under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 287(d) (2000), a section of\nthe United Nations Participation Act providing that the President may appoint\n\u201csuch . . . persons as he may deem necessary to represent the United States in\norgans and agencies of the United Nations.\u201d Under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 287(g), \u201c[a]ll\npersons appointed in pursuance of authority contained in this section shall receive\ncompensation at rates determined by the President upon the basis of duties to be\nperformed but not in excess of rates authorized . . . for chiefs of mission, members\nof the Senior Foreign Service, and Foreign Service officers occupying positions of\nequivalent importance.\u201d The President has delegated to the Secretary of State his\nauthority to fix this compensation, see Memorandum for the Secretary of State,\nfrom President William J. Clinton, Re: Delegation of Authority on Rates of\nCompensation for U.S. Representatives to the United Nations, 62 Fed. Reg. 18,261\n(Apr. 15, 1997), and the Secretary of State in turn has delegated such \u201cmanage- 1\nWe do not address here whether a rollback of a salary increase can satisfy the Ineligibility Clause.

Hall ment-related functions\u201d to the Under Secretary of State for Management, see\nDelegation of Authority No. 198 (Sept. 16, 1992). The last occupant of the office was former Senator George S. McGovern, who\nleft the position on September 27, 2001. 2 At the beginning of Senator McGovern\u2019s\nservice, the responsible official at the State Department assessed the \u201cduties to be\nperformed\u201d by Senator McGovern and determined that he should receive the pay\nof a \u201cMinister-Counselor\u201d in the Senior Foreign Service compensated at a rate\nequivalent to Level 5 of the Executive Schedule (\u201cFE-MC 5,\u201d which is equivalent\nto \u201cES 5\u201d). See Exec. Order No. 12293, \u00a7 4, 3 C.F.R. \u00a7 137 (1982), reprinted in 22\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3901 note (2000). On two recent occasions, Presidents have exercised\ntheir authority under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5382 to raise the salary specified for Level 5 of\nthe Executive Schedule, to which the FE-MC 5 pay is tied. The first increase was\nordered December 23, 2000, and took effect January 14, 2001, Exec. Order\nNo. 13182, 3 C.F.R. \u00a7 330 (2001); the second was ordered December 28, 2001,\nand took effect January 13, 2002, Exec. Order No. 13249, 3 C.F.R. \u00a7 832 (2002). We will assume that one or both of these increases should be deemed to have\noccurred during the time for which Congressman Hall was elected. 3 If the\n\u201cEmoluments\u201d of the office of United States Representative to the United Nations\nAgencies for Food and Agriculture include an FE-MC 5 salary, then that office is\none \u201cthe Emoluments whereof . . . have been encreased\u201d during the time for which\nCongressman Hall was elected. We do not believe, however, that the FE-MC 5 pay or any other salary can\nproperly be seen as the emoluments of this office. On the contrary, the office itself\nhas no fixed emoluments. The President or his delegate is free to set any level of\npay he deems suitable for the duties he expects the particular appointee to perform,\nas long as the pay does not exceed the statutory ceilings. Therefore, if appointed,\nCongressman Hall will not necessarily succeed to the same compensation that\nSenator McGovern was receiving. Indeed, the instrument that directed how much\nSenator McGovern was to be paid was a \u201cNotification of Personnel Action,\u201d\nwhich was personal to him, rather than an order referring generally to the pay of\nthe office. Section 287(g) calls for the President or his delegate to set the pay of\n2 As we understand the facts, only one other person\u2014Millicent Fenwick, during the 1980s\u2014has\nheld the position of United States Representative to the United Nations Agencies for Food and\nAgriculture, with the Senate-confirmed rank of Ambassador. We understand that the paperwork\nshowing how her pay was fixed no longer exists. For the facts set out in this memorandum, we rely on\nthe Department of State. 3 Arguably, the relevant date for the first increase was the date on which the President issued his\norder, which preceded Congressman Hall\u2019s current term.",

Att\u2019y Gen. 381 (1969) (under a statute providing for an\neffective date after a report to Congress and a waiting period to allow congressional action, the relevant\ndate was the date on which the increase took effect). Moreover, because the office was vacant at the\ntime of the second increase and because (as explained below) the pay of the office must be set each\ntime a new appointee assumes the office, arguably the pay of the office was not tied to the FE-MC 5\nrate, or any other rate, at the time of the second increase. 41 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 51 10/22/12 11:13 AM Opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel in Volume 26 \u201c[a]ll persons appointed in pursuance of authority contained in\u201d section 287, and\nthis compensation pertains to the \u201cperson[],\u201d not to the office. This is not a case in which the President raised the pay for a class of offices, in\nwhich the office in question was included. Cf. Appointment of Member of Congress to a Civil Office, 3 Op. O.L.C. at 286-87 (judicial salaries); 1987 Opinion,\nsupra note 1, at 1 n.1 (same); Member of Congress\u2014Appointment to Civil Office\nPrior to Pay Increase, 42 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 381 (1969) (salaries of cabinet officers). Nor even is it a case in which the statute calls on the President to set the salary for\na specified office. Cf. Memorandum for the Files, from William H. Rehnquist,\nAssistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Appointment of Congressman to the Office of Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity at 1 (Apr. 14,\n1969) (\u201c1969 Memorandum\u201d) (third attachment to Letter for Edward L. Morgan,\nDeputy Counsel to the President, from William H. Rehnquist, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Office of Legal Counsel (Apr. 14, 1969)) (the statute required the\nPresident to fix the salary of the Director). Instead, the President is to fix the salary\nof a \u201cperson[]\u201d appointed to an office that the President largely defines. Under the\nstatute here, the President or his delegate is to set a salary each time a person is\nappointed. To be sure, it would not be an unnatural reading of the Ineligibility Clause if\nthe salary paid to Senator McGovern were considered the emoluments of the\noffice of United States Representative, within the meaning of the Clause. That\nsalary was, after all, actually paid for Senator McGovern\u2019s work in the office. Nevertheless, we believe that, on the better view of the Ineligibility Clause, this\nsalary does not constitute the emoluments of the office because the office does not\ncontinue to carry that salary after Senator McGovern\u2019s resignation.",

The President\nor his delegate will have to act affirmatively to set a salary when Senator McGovern\u2019s successor is appointed and will have the discretion to set the salary for the\nnext occupant of the office at any rate that does not exceed the salary cap. 4 The\nIneligibility Clause was designed to limit the danger that offices might be created\nor their emoluments increased \u201cin order to gratify some members\u201d of Congress,\n1 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 380 (Max Farrand ed., rev.\ned. 1966) (statement of James Madison), but this danger, insofar as it arises from\naction taken with respect to an office before a member\u2019s appointment, exists only\nif the prior action would carry over to the office when the member assumes it.

The Budget Director\u2019s salary had been raised during the time for which a prospective Director\nof OEO had been elected to Congress, and the 1969 Memorandum found that if the Director of the\nOEO received a salary at the new ceiling, the Ineligibility Clause would be violated. Id. at 1-2. We take\nit, however, that once the President had set a salary for the office of OEO Director, that salary would\nhave continued to apply to successors in the office, unless the President acted to change his earlier\ndecision. 42 227-329 VOL_26_PROOF.pdf 52 10/22/12 11:13 AM Applicability of Ineligibility Clause to Appointment of Congressman Tony P. Hall lead to some expectations about the salary to be paid to Congressman Hall, see\n119 Cong. Rec. 38,331 (1973) (letter of then-Professor Stephen G. Breyer, arguing\nthat past salary increases, even if not given to an appointee, make future increases\nlikely), this expectation is, in the end, a matter of speculation. Until the President\nacts or his delegate acts, there are no emoluments attached to the office in\nquestion. JAY S.
