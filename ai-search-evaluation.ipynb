Your taxes can be affected if your SSN is used to file a fraudulent return or to claim a refund or credit. • The IRS doesn’t initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages (including shortened links), telephone calls, or social media channels to request or verify personal or financial information. This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), pass- words, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts. • Go to IRS. gov/IdentityTheft, the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take. • Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers assigned to taxpayers to help prevent the misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent federal income tax returns.

For purposes of section 1.472-8(e)(1), for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1981, an inventory price index computed in the manner provided by section 1.472-8(e)(1) will be accepted by the Commissioner as an appropriate method of computing an index, and the use of such inventory price index to compute the LIFO value of a dollar-value inventory pool will be accepted as accurate, reliable, and suitable. A taxpayer using the inventory price index computation method provided by section 1.472-8(e)(3) must use such method in determining the value of all goods for which the taxpayer has elected to use the LIFO method. Treas. Reg. § 1.472-8(e)(3)(iii) in effect for years prior to 2001 provides: Selection of consumer or producer price indexes--(A) In general. An inventory price index computed as provided by section 1.472-8(e)(3) is computed with reference to the consumer or producer price indexes for specific categories of inventory items in the CPI Detailed Report or Producer Prices and Price Indexes published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Treas. Reg. § 1.472-8(e)(3)(iii)(C) in effect for years prior to 2001 provides: Other selection requirements. Manufacturers, processors, wholesalers, jobbers, and distributors may select indexes from only Producer Prices and Price Indexes. Retailers may select indexes from either the CPI Detailed Report or Producer Prices and Price Indexes, but if equally appropriate indexes could be selected from either publication, a retailer using the retail inventory method must select the index from the CPI Detailed Report and a retailer not using the retail inventory method must select the index from Producer Prices and Price Indexes. If a retailer using the retail inventory method selects a price index from Producer Prices and Price Indexes, the selected index must be converted into a retail price index. If a retailer not using the retail inventory method selects an index from the CPI Detailed Report, the selected index must be converted into a cost price index. Manufacturers, processors, wholesalers, jobbers, and distributors, must convert selected indexes into cost price indexes. Revenue Ruling 54-49, 1954-1 C.B. 32, provides: A specialty store on the cost inventory method does not ordinarily compute the net markon percentages for its respective departments, for this is a tool of the retail inventory method.

All other filers requesting the deceased taxpayer's refund must file the return and attach Form 1310. For more details, use Tax Topic 356 or see Pub. 559.

This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), pass- words, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts. • Go to IRS. gov/IdentityTheft, the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take. • Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers assigned to taxpayers to help prevent the misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent federal income tax returns.

Treas. Reg. § 1.472-8(e)(3)(iii)(C) in effect for years prior to 2001 provides: Other selection requirements. Manufacturers, processors, wholesalers, jobbers, and distributors may select indexes from only Producer Prices and Price Indexes. Retailers may select indexes from either the CPI Detailed Report or Producer Prices and Price Indexes, but if equally appropriate indexes could be selected from either publication, a retailer using the retail inventory method must select the index from the CPI Detailed Report and a retailer not using the retail inventory method must select the index from Producer Prices and Price Indexes. If a retailer using the retail inventory method selects a price index from Producer Prices and Price Indexes, the selected index must be converted into a retail price index. If a retailer not using the retail inventory method selects an index from the CPI Detailed Report, the selected index must be converted into a cost price index.
